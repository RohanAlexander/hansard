The whole point of of time in this debate focusing on the the government's proposal is to reduce emissions in Australia. At the most basic argument, the carbon tax fails in this Residents in my electorate have constantly purpose. The only way the government is contacted me about the impact that this going to reach its emissions reduction targets carbon tax is going to have on their family, is to buy offshore carbon credits from their household or their business. People tell foreign carbon traders. Under Labor's me how this tax is going to mean that their proposal, the government itself estimates that small business is going to struggle even more Australia will be spending $3½ billion than before when their expenses go up under purchasing carbon credits from foreign the carbon tax. Labor members have spent a carbon traders in 2020.

They informed me carbon tax can reduce emissions is if people that their annual power bill is $1.3 million, use less coal produced electricity and less oil 70 per cent of which is for street lighting. powered transport. The problem with this is Based on the government's own figures, the that the use of electricity is inelastic-not carbon tax will have an instant impact of entirely, but quite significantly.

There is no governance of the country. The government chance to reflect on our own policy is trying to nobble the resources of the PBO commitments and on the calibration of those and the basis from which it can start.

In relation to the importance of that point and the question that goes to this amendment This has not been a long standing regarding forecasts, I simply make the point commitment of the government. They rushed that it is essential that, when the public is in legislation in response to our policy being given an opportunity to test the value proposal, and their legislation is deficient. of the proposals that have been put forward That is why the shadow Treasurer has by the respective parties, they can have some needed to bring forward an amendment, confidence that the parameters and the which he has done so very ably. What he has forecasts upon which those costings have brought forward is an amendment to make been based are comparable. If that were not sure that the Parliamentary Budget Office, the case, that would lead to a very when it is brought into effect, will be an destructive and very wasteful discussion, independent parliamentary budget office, particularly in the course of election that it will not be unduly restricted in what it campaigns, around parameters and can look at and what it can do in the assumptions rather than where that debate performance of its role and function. Critical should be focused, which is on the question to that, of course, is the fact that it should be of the actual costs of the proposals that have able to have regard to its own ability to been put forward by the respective parties, so perform economic forecasts and budget that the electors, the people of Australia, can estimates. It can of course have regard to go to that election in full confidence that the Treasury's economic forecasts and budget policies of the respective parties have been estimates, but it also should be able to properly and comparably costed so that they initiate its own if in fact it believes it is can make their judgments. It is on that basis required. that we are opposed to the amendment that The government's bill restricts the ability the member for North Sydney has brought of the Parliamentary Budget Office to look at forward. only Treasury and Finance figures, and this of course goes to the power of the Parliamentary Budget Office to perform its own functions.

297,The Speaker,"Order! It being 10.30 (2) any variation to this arrangement to be madeMonday, 19 September 2011 Canning Electorate: Paid Parental Leave compliance burden being imposed on employers by the Gillard Labor government with regard to paid parental leave-PPL-payments. The red tape affects many businesses in my electorate, particularly small businesses. Mr Don Pember, the CEO of the Mandurah Retirement Village, tells me that the Labor government's way of handling these payments is significantly affecting his business. Mr Pember has expressed his concerns with regard to the additional administrative work his organisation must undertake to make these payments. This is because the Labor government has chosen to dump the responsibility for making the paid parental leave payments on the employer. The extra administrative work is gained through the double handling of payments by both Centrelink and the employer. When the Labor government decided that, from July this year, employers were to be responsible for processing the PPL payments and also having to deal with Centrelink to gain the initial funds to do so, they effectively forced employers to become PPL pay clerks. The coalition believes that the government expenditure incurred to establish the Centrelinkadministered PPL system should have continued to deliver benefits to the Australian people beyond the six-month shelf-life the Gillard government determined. Mandurah Retirement Village employs more than 100 female employees and at least five per cent of the workforce could be on maternity leave at any one time. This means more of the village's resources are being dedicated to administering these payments. This includes familiarising the PPL pay clerks with their obligations and responsibilities; changes to payroll and accounting systems and software; the processing of payments; and compliance, verification and reporting requirements. On top of this, there are significant fines that can be issued to employers who fail to comply with the various obligations under the scheme. I would add that the coalition, through the shadow Minister for Small Business, Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, Bruce Billson, actually attempted to remove the unnecessary administrative compliance burden via the Paid Parental Leave (Reduction of Compliance Burden for Employers) Amendment Bill 2010. Unfortunately, those on the Labor side voted it down, and the burden continues for the Mandurah Retirement Village and other small businesses like it. This is a disgrace. It just demonstrates that the Labor Party has no sympathy for small businesses on this compliance double handling. In fact they are not interested in small business at all; they are interested in red tape rather than in seeing a properly administered scheme that saves small businesses the extra time in compliance that this initiative has put on them.

I attended their open day not that long ago. They invited the community and the residents close by and it was attended by many people, including young people and families, and everyone had a shot at hitting the ball with the racket. It was a great day. The club itself has been there for many years as a facility allowing local residents to participate in the great sport of tennis, whether people play it seriously or just for fun. In fact, I remember many years ago going down there myself and having a hit when I was a kid and a teenager, because I lived close by. I would like to congratulate everyone involved in the club; the president, Robbie Tregoweth; the vice president, Chris Brock; and the club captain, Anthony Mezic. They are doing an enormous amount of work on promoting the club in the area, on attracting new members on a regular basis and on ensuring that they let the community know about the club and that they are there for people to participate in that wonderful sport of tennis. The club is currently seeking funding to refurbish and do some resurfacing of their tennis courts. It is interesting that the club courts are on the edge of Mellor Park, which is a park with massive gum trees. A couple of these gum trees are right on the edge of these courts. Fortunately or unfortunately they are significant trees, and they are lifting up the surface of the court. Therefore, we recently made representations to the council to ask for some funding. I was very pleased when the City of West Torrens confirmed that they are going to provide $60,000 in funding to resurface this particular project. You cannot cut down the trees because they are significant and beautiful 100to 150-year-old gum trees, so they are going to lift the surface above the ground and keep the surface at a raised level so the roots do not interfere with the surface and they can continue to enjoy playing tennis on these wonderful courts in this wonderful park. I know the club are also in discussions with Tennis SA to see what further funding they can be provided with to pay for the rest of the project. I look forward to a very, very positive outcome. The club, as I said, services the community in a great way to allow people to exercise and to take up the wonderful sport of tennis. I wish the club members an enjoyable and very successful summer season, which is about to begin.

Karryne's petition draws the attention of the House and of the people of Australia to the fact that Northern Territorians do indeed abhor the appalling treatment of our livestock in rogue Indonesian abattoirs. However, the blanket ban imposed by the Gillard Labor government has had a significant impact on the Northern Territory's economy. It is an industry worth over $300 million a year and the ban has severely impacted businesses and families-families like Karryne's. While the trade has restarted, the impact is still being felt across Northern Australia.

It was really wonderful just to see so many supportive Territorians travel to witness history in the making. Jake Dignan was awarded the Joe Grant medal for the grand final best on field; Darren Ewing was the highest goal kicker for the season; and Thunder captain Cameron Ilett was awarded the Grogan medal. The win was also great for Will Farrer, who celebrated his 21st birthday yesterday. He had a fantastic day kicking some great goals and also displaying his marking capability. We all know Andrew Mcleod was a legend in the Crows but he has been even better in the Territory Thunder and it was great watching the game with his dad, Jock.

Fraser Electorate: Superannuation Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (10:40): According to the Australian Taxation Office, Australians have around $19 billion in lost superannuation accounts. That is a bit over $1,000 for every adult in the country. Lost superannuation accounts arise when people change jobs and forget to update their superannuation accounts or when they take a career break. When you have your money spread across more accounts, you might end up paying excess fees or having your money invested in the wrong assets. Many people never claim lost superannuation so they do not enjoy the standard of living in retirement that is rightfully theirs. If MAIN COMMITTEE",212,Constituency Statements

To address the issue of lost superannuation, Chris Bourke MLA suggested that he and I run a campaign to let Canberrans know how to find their lost superannuation. Chris pointed out that lost superannuation is a particular problem in postcode 2615. In that postcode alonewhich covers suburbs like Dunlop, Holt, Flynn, Melba, Spence and Macgregor-there is $45 million in lost superannuation. So we launched a campaign to let Canberrans know about the ATO SuperSeeker website and the hotline, 13 28 65. In Civic we chatted to a part-time actor, who had recently found $6,000 in lost superannuation from a previous job. In Kippax we met Kevin Rourke, who had read about our campaign in the Northside Chronicle. Kevin logged on to our laptop on Saturday and found lost superannuation for a job he had as a panel beater in the mid-1980s. The employer had died and Kevin had not known which superannuation fund he had put the money in. Thanks to the ATO's SuperSeeker website, Kevin has been reunited with his retirement savings from a quarter of a century ago. My thanks go to Louise Crossman and Barbara Phi from my office and Margaret Watt from Chris Bourke's office, who came up with the idea. I am also grateful to Lisa Mosley from WIN News, who helped us publicise the campaign locally. Quote of the day went to a shopper outside Charnwood Woolworths. Chris Bourke said to her, 'Did you know there is $45 million in lost superannuation in this postcode alone?' Quick as a flash, she replied, 'I'll take it!' Finally, I want to use this chance to mention Eddie Sharp, who has been selling the Big Issue magazine in Canberra for over a year, working through the Woden Community Service. Eddie came up to say g'day when we launched the superannuation campaign in Civic. We were shocked to learn that he died of a heart attack the next day. Eddie was just 44. My condolences go to his family and his large circle of friends for their loss. Barker Electorate: Exceptional Circumstances Exit Grants Package government's failure to correctly deliver the exit grant package for farmers wishing to exit the industry. This was a Howard government initiative that we administered without a problem. Farmers situated in exceptional circumstance declared areas were made aware that government had extended the EC exit grant package as part of the 2011-12 budget. The total commitment from the Labor government was $14.4 million. An initial $9.6 million was allocated for the 2011-12 financial year. When the money ran out after a quick take-up exhausted the initial amount, an extra $4.8 million was provided, but that is still not enough. For farmers in Barker, this meant that many missed out on this package. My office has fielded calls from constituents who are rightly very angry and upset because they have made arrangements for their future on advice from agencies only to find out there is no more money. For two families from the Riverland, this means that they proceeded to sell their properties after seeking advice from Centrelink and being pre-assessed as eligible. After successfully selling their respective properties in a tough market-as you can understand, given the hardship the EC areas have experienced-these families were then told the money had run out and they would not receive a grant.

I have written to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Joe Ludwig, and to the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, to inform them both about the problems occurring in my electorate, but I am yet to see any support or compassion. The agriculture minister told the Australian on Saturday that it was very clear that this program provided access to a capped amount of funding for exit grants. I would ask the minister: does he have the numbers on how many exit grant applications were banked up from previous financial years and how many new applications received the $14.4 million package? If it is the case that applications were banked up and the whole $14.4 million was used to clear those, then clearly the new applications should have been considered and the minister should explain himself. For many farmers it is a very difficult decision to leave the farm for a new life. Many of these people know of no other job than the land, and leaving it is a last resort. Formula One in Schools Program to past and present students of Brooks High School in Launceston. They are now in Malaysia representing Australia at the Formula One Technology Challenge world finals. The F1 in Schools program is a science, technology, engineering and maths based education competition implemented in high schools around the world. Through the appeal of Formula One racing, the program gives challenges in engineering and design while stimulating an interest in engineering related careers and connecting young people to the industry. Over 35,000 Australian students take part each year. This year a team made up of current and former students of Brooks High School in my electorate of Bass have continued Australia's tradition of achievement in the program. The team, known as the 'PentaGliders', will compete in the world finals in design, analysis, testing, manufacturing and racing of CO2 powered balsawood Formula One cars. It was fantastic to meet the team marketing manager, Amy Winter, the design and aerodynamic engineer, Tristan McCarthy, and to hear about the benefits and achievements of the F1 in Schools program. The students have been enjoying the chance for hands-on learning while improving their public speaking skills, team presentation and awareness of modern engineering technologies. The PentaGliders recently competed at the national titles in Sydney. They won the Australian Grand Prix Corporation fastest car award, the best energy efficient design, and became the first Tasmanian team to win the national titles and progress through to the world finals. Amy, Tristan, resource and graphics manager Nathan Clark and manufacturing engineer Jack Ball are today in Malaysia as the Australian representatives at the world championships. For those interested, the event will be broadcast today at 4 pm on the F1 in Schools website. The F1 in Schools program has allowed the PentaGliders to develop close relationships with sponsors and local industry and business. Sponsors are recognised through local media events, on cars, posters and videos and on the team's uniform. Local industry is also closely involved with the PentaGliders. Businesses such as ACL Bearing, Dixon Plastics and Rio Tinto have been providing assistance to the team. MAIN COMMITTEE",214,Constituency Statements

Bradfield Electorate: Home Insulation Program failed Home Insulation Program on my constituent Mr Doug Mill and his long-established home insulation business, the Demand Group, in my electorate. When the Rudd government announced the Home Insulation Program in February 2009, the Demand Group invested heavily in anticipation of the program-indeed, they felt there was little option. But things started to go very wrong. The problems Doug Mill observed included watering down the skill requirements of installers, the delay in auditing and the reduction in the rebate amounts, which, in turn, led to inferior products. The program began to unravel and was closed in February 2010. It was in the latter stages of the program, and in the mop-up schemes after the program was cancelled, where, in the words of Mr Mill, the 'fun' really started for him and his business as they sought to comply with the new requirements that were imposed. For example, Mr Mill says he faced administrative failure when the government failed to register the insulation products his company used as approved products. Additionally, Mr Mill says, his applications for competency and compliance were rejected based on erroneous information. Mr Mill has commented: Our experience with dealing with this Program through this Government has been disastrous for us financially and has depleted our business to a third the size and is not therefore viable. By completing 1.1 million homes it has taken about 15 years of work away. By overlooking us for Home Insulation Safety Program it has excluded us from millions of dollars of Inspection and rectification work and by allowing untrained people to install it has taken work away from legitimate businesses like ours … The Demand Group, together with similar businesses, has made a legal claim for compensation against the Commonwealth. When these businesses met the Commonwealth lawyers they were told that the Commonwealth was not liable. But the government lawyers suggested they consider making a claim under the Scheme for Compensation for Detriment caused by Defective Administration, the CDDA scheme. Mr Mill therefore made an application to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. After the four different inquiries and investigations that have taken place into the Home Insulation Program, it is clear that there was defective administration in the operation of the scheme, suggesting that the threshold requirement for the application of the CDDA scheme has been met. Long-established businesses in the insulation sector, such as but certainly not limited to the Demand Group, have paid a very high price for the Rudd government's incompetent administration of the Home Insulation Program. I call on the minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency to give careful consideration, in good faith, to the claims lodged by the Demand Group and other affected insulation businesses.

306,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield) (10:49,"I rise to speak of the impact of the government'sBig Steps Campaign Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (10:52): I recently had the pleasure of meeting with seven Western Australian representatives from the Big Steps in childcare campaign, all of whom are managers of early childhood education centres in the Perth metropolitan area. They talked to me about the critical need to ensure the provision of professional wages for professional people in this industry. The Big Steps in childcare campaign, which is supported by the childcare workers union United Voice, aims to tackle the inequities currently present in the childcare industry and to thereby stop droves of childcare professionals leaving this industry for better paid, lower stress, lower responsibility jobs. The people I met shared with me their commitment to the essential work of early years learning and development education. Their vocational passion and expertise are inspiring, and the time during and after conventional work hours that they commit to their profession is above and beyond the pay and conditions they receive. The group presented me with over 30 letters from other centre managers and workers, all expressing their concerns and requests for the improvement of the early childhood education sector. They identified some of the contributing factors towards this crisis as follows: low wages paid to employees, usually not much above the minimum award rates, and absence of pay parity between early childhood workers and school education sectors. The average salary for childcare centre managers in Australia is just over $52,000 a year. For a principal of a small primary school it is $113,000. In WA a first year state school teacher will be on over $55,000 plus allowances compared to an annual salary of around $34,000 for a certificate III childcare worker. Other factors include the lack of opportunities for career progression, expectations on workers to perform unpaid labour and lack of adequate programming and staff development time. The WA representatives I met with explained to me that they will be expected to implement the new early childhood national curriculum in their centres but will not get the same, if any, level of training, support and development as school teachers are predicted to receive. It is not acceptable that people in whom we place the responsibility of educating and caring for those among the most vulnerable in our community-our youngest––who enter this profession because of their love for children and for the educational task, are underrecognised and undercompensated for their work. I was happy to see the support shown by my caucus colleagues when representatives from the Big Steps campaign visited federal parliament last month. Senator Carol Brown spoke in support of the campaign, and I know that many other members of the government are supportive of the cause, including Senator Kate Lundy, who has established the childcare champions group in the Labor caucus. The government is keenly aware of the importance of creating a sustainable and professional childcare sector that can provide affordable and highquality education and care for Australia's children. For that reason I support further reform and funding to deliver a fair and proper set of working conditions. Macarthur Electorate: Relay for Life Relay for Life at the Camden showground.

I would like to publicly congratulate the Rotary Club of Camden for their hard work organising this event, especially its committee members: Greg Eagles, Chris Evans, Bruce Farquharson, John Lee, Rowan Moore, Peter Claxton, Kevyn Moore, Ken Macaulay, Alan Redman, Dylan Evans, Lindsey Thomas, Tania and Brian Franzman, Cindy Cagney, Jo de Souza, Aaron Hodges, John Saunderson, Stephen Humphries, Warwick Richardson and Ross Newport. The Relay for Life brings members of the community together for a night of fun, entertainment, celebration and remembrance. Each Relay for Life event is organised by a local volunteer committee on behalf of the Cancer Council. The atmosphere in Camden on Saturday was electric, with everybody coming together to celebrate life, remember those we have lost, support local carers and offer hope to those living with cancer. On SaturdayI met with Team Footprints, a team made up of two families who have both lost their mums to cancer. The Spain family walk each year in memory of their mum, Jill, who died from lung cancer in 2007. Their friends the Barry family walk to remember their mum, Cathy, who died in 2006 from breast cancer. The group have been friends for many years and said that taking part in such a positive event is what their mums would have wanted. This is the fourth relay the group have taken part in. The first walk was on the first anniversary of Jill's death. The group thought it would be a nice way to honour her fight against cancer. When I met the families on Saturday, they said they supported the Cancer Council because it raised money for research and drug trials which gave them extra time with their mum. Jill was extremely sick when she began a medical trial 16 months before she died. The trial was working really well and Jill went from being on an oxygen tank to going to the gym and walking on a treadmill. The tumours were shrinking but unfortunately the trial drug eventually stopped working. The Spain family said the trial gave them an extra 14 goodquality months with their mum and that inspired them to help raise funds for the Cancer Council each year. The Cancer Council is Australia's leading cancer charity and is dedicated to beating cancer through research. Its groundbreaking work in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer has saved thousands of lives. Sadly, statistics show that one in two of us will still get cancer at some point in our lives. On SaturdayI learnt that more than 200 people are diagnosed with cancer in the Camden local government area each year. The Cancer Council's vital work, funded entirely by the public, will help ensure that thousands will survive. On SaturdayI was very moved to see local survivors and carers walk the first lap of the event together while the rest of us cheered them on. A candlelight ceremony of hope was held at dusk to remember those who we have lost to cancer, and many locals made a personal pledge on how they would make a change to help fight cancer. I felt very proud to see so many people from my community come together on Saturday night to support each other and share in a common hope for a future without cancer, a future where families like the Spain and Barry families would never have to say goodbye to the ones they love. National Disability Insurance Scheme Ms KING (Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure and Transport and Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing) (10:58): They say a measure of a society is the way that it treats its most vulnerable. That is a fairly discomforting thought when you consider the state of Australia's disability sector. Early in August the Prime Minister released MAIN COMMITTEE a report by the Productivity Commission into the long-term care and support for Australians with a disability, and I want to take this opportunity to put on record my support for a national disability insurance scheme and also commend the work of Every Australian Counts. The Productivity Commission found that Australia's disability services system was unfair, underfunded and fragmented. The report states that fundamental change is needed to provide the kind of care we expect for people with disabilities. The Gillard government agrees. We commissioned the report from the Productivity Commission because we knew that the system was not working as well as it should and that reform was necessary. I know that across the electorate of Ballarat there are hard working agencies and organisations and many generous and wholehearted volunteers doing much to make the lives of people with disabilities in our community as fulfilling as possible, but the government knows that there is much more that needs to be done. Many parents who care for their children with disabilities do not have confidence that, when they are too old or frail to shoulder the responsibility, the system will provide the right kind of care for their children. Some people with disabilities do not have the confidence that, when they need basic medical aids like a wheelchair or access to services like rehabilitation, which can help them get into training or work or into independent living, they will get the support they need. Australians who acquire a disability, or whose children or grandchildren might be born with disability, do not have confidence that the system will be there to support them into the future. The Productivity Commission has recommended that Australians should be insured against significant disabilities so that people with disabilities get the kind of care and support we expect for them and so Australians can have peace of mind that, if they acquire a disability through accident or disease, they will get the helping hand that they need. Reform of this kind does take time. The Productivity Commission has said that it would take at least seven years to transform disability services, but we do want to get started right away and I am pleased that the government has committed some $10 million to commence that very important early work. We do have a lot of work ahead of us to deliver the kind of care and support for Australians with disabilities that we expect. This report is the first step and there are many, many more to come. Disability does not discriminate and can and does affect families every single day. We all deserve to have the confidence to know that, if something did happen to us, our partner, our parent or our child, there is a strong system of support in place. order 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. National Standard for Fertiliser Products Debate resumed on the motion by Mr Pyne: That this House: (1) notes that consumers currently have little information made available to them in choosing which fertiliser product for private and domestic use will suit their needs, and which fertiliser products may damage their plants; (2) recognises: (a) that existing voluntary standards produced by Standards Australia, such as AS 4454, do not always provide consumers with sufficient information to ensure their fertiliser product is fit for its purpose; MAIN COMMITTEE",217,Constituency Statements

In accordance with standing(b) that the industry has made calls to urgently address anomalies between all compost standards, particularly contaminant levels, to ensure a high quality product that will improve soil health and productivity; and (c) the recommendation of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural Related Industries in its pricing and supply arrangements in the Australian and Global Fertiliser Market report, to implement, as a matter of priority, uniform description and labelling of fertiliser products to ensure consistency between jurisdictions; and (3) calls on the Australian Government to work with the States and Territories to establish a national standard for fertiliser products for private and domestic use that are made available for sale in Australia: (a) requiring uniform labelling; and (b) prescribing the acceptable range of ingredient levels for fertiliser products such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and pH. contribute to the growing success, usability and uptake of one of Australia's emerging sustainable industries-the industry for compost, soil conditioners and mulches. The motion extends to all fertiliser products sold for private or domestic use, including the use of compost, soil conditioners and mulches as forms of fertiliser products. The motion calls on the government to work with state authorities towards standardising the labelling of compost products and prescribing the acceptable range of ingredient levels to be included in compost made available for sale for private or domestic use. This is an important matter that was brought to my attention by Desmond Kerr in my electorate. Mr Kerr has experienced first hand the consequences of not having proper industry standardisation and labelling in place. When we think about the benefits that compost can have in gardens for private and domestic use, Mr Kerr's story is particularly relevant to understanding the risks dedicated gardeners face in purchasing compost without proper labelling and standards. Mr Kerr purchased compost from a local distributer that had a pH level that was dramatically higher than the neutral level of seven, where I am advised compost pH should roughly sit. Rather than aiding Mr Kerr's plants to grow, by having the incorrect ingredient mix this compost was not fit for purpose and began suffocating his plants by preventing them from receiving the nutrients they required. Purchasing plants and maintaining a garden can be a very expensive pastime. Australians who understand the benefits of compost should be able to purchase it knowing that what they are buying will in fact help their plants and not kill them. Like Mr Kerr, all gardeners should know what is in the compost we are buying, what the pH level of the compost is and what other ingredients it may contain. I understand there are a range of factors influencing the optimal growing potential of compost. Some compost may be more appropriate in certain conditions than others. Some compost products currently being sold, such as the one purchased by Mr Kerr with a pH that was drastically inappropriate for the growing conditions of the area and without proper labelling or standards, create a confidence crisis among gardeners who understand the benefits of purchasing compost and have an impact on the industry. According to key findings published by Nursery and Garden Industry Australia, 86 per cent of Australians have a lawn, implying some form of garden where compost could have an affect either on the growth potential or on the amount of water consumed to maintain their MAIN COMMITTEE",219,Private Members Business
309,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Manager of Opposition Business) (11:04): This motion seeks togarden. Data reveals that over 57 per cent of Australians and over 62 per cent of married couples grow their own vegetables, herbs and fruit plants. Noting the increasing cost-of-living pressures that face families under this Labor government and the benefits gained by growing vegetables, herbs and fruit plants at home, these statistics reinforce the importance of supporting a viable compost industry. Mr Husic: I am staggered that you can make a political point out of this. far too practical, common sense and man-on-the-Clapham-bus for the Labor Party to take any interest in these matters these days. What happened to the old Labor Party, who actually cared? What happened to the old Labor Party who used to care about people in their electorates? With over 72 per cent of Australians intending to purchase plants for their garden during spring, this motion seeks to ensure that these Australians are provided with information on the quality of the compost they intend to buy, creating greater consumer confidence that increases demand for compost across the country. The compost industry in Australia has a turnover of more than $600 million per annum, employs more than 1,900 full-time employees and has an investment in capital of over half a billion dollars. It is growing increasingly larger and developing intellectual property with huge environmental potential. This motion, which seeks to encourage the uptake of compost for private and domestic use, would contribute to the future growth of this important Australian industry. The initiative would contribute to better nourishment of plants and gardens and would have a real impact on the environment by diverting landfill to create quality compost. The compost industry recycles more than 5.8 million tonnes of organic material each year and has the potential to recycle an additional 13 million tonnes from landfill. Given this extra potential, if the industry's long-run supply curve could shift rightward, reducing landfill, methane and CO2 emissions, then we as policy makers must consider what factors would need to change to increase the demand for compost. This motion recognises the good work that the industry is already doing to rewrite AS 4454, and calls on the government to bring their political will to fast-track this work to ensure the future of this important Australian industry. Concepts of compost quality and labelling were essentially unknown worldwide as recently as 1985 when governments began understanding the importance of establishing an acceptable framework for the industry to operate in. In 1992 the compost quality seal was established by the German Compost Quality Association. It is suggested that this quality seal provided a good starting point for recognition of quality in the industry and has now been adopted by the European Commission in developing the European Ecolabel seal for soil improvers. Globally, countries are recognising the significant developments that are occurring in the compost industry and are implementing processes for quality control and labelling, including by statutory means, to ensure this emerging sustainable industry is able to flourish. This motion seeks to support the good work already occurring at an industry level and to maintain Australia's high standards and commitment to composting. I am aware that AS 4454, the Australian Standard on composts, soil conditioners and mulches, is currently being reviewed by industry and that industry are taking steps to ensure labelling and product consistency between jurisdictions in Australia. The industry, and in particular industry bodies such as Compost Australia, should be commended for their significant contribution to the MAIN COMMITTEE",220,Private Members Business
310,Mr Pyne,"The member from the Labor Party thinks this is tremendously amusing. It isstandardisation of procedures in this area, particularly with respect to required markings and health and hazard warning labels, which I am advised are some of the most robust hazard warning labels in the world. Notwithstanding the good work of the industry to date, it appears that one of the factors that is recognised as presenting a barrier to broader market acceptance of compost has been uncertainty about the consistency of compost. I am aware that this has been recognised in the discussion paper Does AS 4454 adequately benchmark compost quality?-required reading for anybody interested in this subject. I am sure the member for Chifley has read this paper. This discussion paper went on to report that: Analysis of 52 different garden organics end-products showed that the Victorian limit for copper was exceeded on 46% of occasions, 63% of occasions for zinc and 50% of occasions for chromium. These data support the need for a revision of the heavy metal limits used in the Australian Standard for composts, soil conditioners and mulches … Further, and as members of this House may recall, the first recommendation of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Related Industries in their report on Pricing and supply arrangements in the Australian and global fertiliser market, a catchy title, was that: … the states and territories should consider, as a matter of priority, adopting uniform description and labelling of fertiliser products to ensure consistency between jurisdictions. While the compost industry should be applauded for taking steps to standardise the labelling and ingredient requirements of compost products in Australia, the government must also take responsibility. To drive investment in this industry and to support the uptake of compost technologies with lasting environmental benefits, the government must be prepared to roll up its sleeves, to adopt the recommendations of the senate committee's report and to work with the states in developing these compost standards that will see lasting environmental and productivity benefits for Australia. The government must be prepared to stand up for recreational gardeners like my constituent Des Kerr and to ensure that the quality of compost made available for private and domestic use is fit for purpose, with the appropriate ingredient mix and compost labelling. I thank my colleagues who intend to take part in this debate for their support on this motion-the member for Longman and the member for Riverina, and also the Labor members of parliament, who will make inadequate contributions but will do their best. I commend the motion to the House. this motion. I also welcome it on the basis that it presents a diversity of issues that need to be considered by us all. I think it is timely, particularly given that there is a lot of interest in these issues within households. You only need to turn on a TV to see the different lifestyle programs that talk about what people can do in their homes and about installing and maintaining gardens. Also people's interest in sustainability issues is something that is continuing to grow. People are wanting to grow their own vegetables and herbs-and, as the member for Sturt indicated, between 67 and 52 per cent of people, depending on what demographic you pick, are doing so. As much as I was supportive of the member for Sturt raising this matter today, I could not help a wry smile when he managed to insert political points in a debate that I think is worthy of having in this place. He gave me cause for reflection on some of the issues he sought to have a go at on the way through his speech. Nonetheless the matter is worthy of MAIN COMMITTEE",221,Private Members Business
311,Mr Husic (Chifley,"Government Whip) (11:10): I welcome the opportunity to discussconsideration. The member for Sturt referred to his constituent, Des Kerr, who has serious concerns about what he perceived to be a misrepresentation about pH levels in the fertiliser that he had purchased and was using on his property, that the PH levels were much higher than stated on the product packaging. It is worth reminding all consumers to make inquiries of merchants about whether a product is fit for purpose, and that certainly includes fertiliser products. If consumers are not sure about a product, obviously the golden rule is to ask and to test the representations that are made. Fortunately, consumers have protections under Australian Consumer Law-ACL. This government has taken steps to strengthen the ACL and those took effect in January this year. Consumer guarantees under the ACL cover any type of goods or services costing up to $40,000 sold in trade or commerce. The big message here is that for people concerned about representations made about what is in fertilisers or composted products-though more often than not it is fertilisers; a lot of people are taking up the opportunity to compost on their own property using waste products-the ACL provides a range of protections for any product under $40,000. People should definitely avail themselves of those protections. Consumer guarantees also allow consumers to seek redress if the goods they buy are not fit for the purpose specified by the people selling the product. It is worth noting that the ACL consolidates up to 20 Commonwealth, state and territory laws into one single harmonised law. The member for Sturt said that we need to take a national approach on this issue and the government are seeking to do just that in terms of Consumer Law. For consumers seeking to purchase fertilisers for home or business use there is some sort of protection regardless of where they live. Consumers will also be interested to know, especially businesses that operate in more than one state or territory, that the benefit of having a single consumer law generates commercial and consumer benefit. The Productivity Commission believe that about $4.5 billion of benefit to the Australian economy flows as a result of having a unified Consumer Law. As I mentioned earlier, there are about nine guarantees for products. These include suppliers and manufacturers guaranteeing that goods are of acceptable quality; secondly suppliers and manufacturers guaranteeing that the goods will be reasonably fit for any purpose the consumer or supplier specifies, especially in terms of the matters that are brought here before the Main Committee; suppliers and manufacturers guaranteeing that the description of goods is accurate; suppliers guaranteeing that goods will match any sample or demonstration model; suppliers and manufacturers guaranteeing that goods will satisfy any extra promises made about them in the form of express warranties; suppliers guaranteeing that they have the right to sell the goods being supplied or that no-one will try to repossess or take back those goods; suppliers guaranteeing that the goods being supplied are free from hidden securities or charges; and, finally, manufacturers or importers guaranteeing that they will take reasonable steps to provide spare parts or repair facilities for a reasonable time after purchase. Not all of those guarantees, obviously, relate to the matters at hand, but the guarantee regarding the accuracy of the description of the goods and the guarantee that the goods themselves be reasonably fit are certainly important protections, particularly in reference to the matter that the member for Sturt raised about whether or not pH levels were matching the representations made to the consumer on the packaging. As the member for Sturt referred to, there has also been a voluntary product safety standard in place since 2003, AS 4454, covering compost, soil conditioners and mulches, which MAIN COMMITTEE includes guidance on required pH levels. Any products that purport to meet the voluntary standard but which are found not to, in fact, meet that standard, risk breaching the misleading representation provisions of ACL, some of which I mentioned earlier, and they could face significant penalties. While we would acknowledge that individual members of the public have, from time to time, expressed concern about labelling requirements for fertiliser products, the government is not aware of a wider community concern about excessive pH levels in these products. Coming back to the point I made at the start of my contribution today, the raising, particularly within parliament, of these types of issues gives us an opportunity to take note of the fact that there is a concern out there. While the member for Sturt has raised this issue on behalf of his constituent, it is obviously incumbent upon us all to take steps to monitor whether there is a wider concern-and to act accordingly if there is. However, at this point calls for a mandatory standard would definitely increase the regulatory burden and on-costs for business, and any additional cost would ultimately be passed on to consumers. We have to be certain that there is widespread concern to justify consumers paying more. We have undertaken significant regulatory reform to lift those burdens on businesses. One critical step we have taken has been the bringing in of harmonised consumer laws, but we have also brought in reforms in a range of other important areas, such as standard business reporting, trade licensing, consumer credit and national construction codes. While not related to this matter, these reforms demonstrate that we are trying to take steps on a number of fronts to reduce those burdens on businesses, especially small businesses. While there are concerns, as have been expressed so far in the debate, we need to be balanced in deciding at what point we take action and whether or not that action would be disproportionate to the issue raised. If there is evidence of a widespread problem, the government will certainly consult further with states and territories. I would certainly encourage them to do that and I think that is part of the call being made here today. One of the other points raised by the member for Sturt was the fact that, while at the moment 5.8 million tonnes of compost are being recycled, by extracting out of landfill there is the potential for another 13 million. At that point, depending on whether or not the concerns are as widespread as may be suggested, then, given the size of that potential, we need to look at what the standards need to be. But at this point, while the issue is definitely one that needs to be taken on board, there is a matter of whether or not the response needs to be as widespread or as definite as what has been outlined so far. But I certainly welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate and to learn more about an issue that has obviously sparked some concern in the member for Sturt's electorate. motion, which calls for uniform guidelines for the labelling and regulation of fertiliser products for private and domestic use in Australia. This motion rightly recognises that the information currently available to individuals purchasing fertiliser products is limited and that, in many cases, consumers are not being provided with information sufficient to determine whether a product is appropriate for the purpose they require it, including if a product might be damaging to some plants or hazardous to health. The current system of voluntary regulation for labelling and composition of fertilisers varies across all states and territories and ultimately impacts consumers' ability to make an informed purchase decision. MAIN COMMITTEE The Senate Select Committee on Agriculture and Related Industries reported in its report Pricing and supply arrangements in the Australian and global fertiliser market that the fertiliser product industry has been largely left without any regulation in the area of product labelling. The report highlighted that the industry itself has been calling for uniformity in compost standards to ensure that fertiliser products are of a high standard. The report's first recommendation was that the states and territories should consider, as a matter of priority, adopting uniform description and labelling of fertiliser products to ensure consistency between jurisdictions. It is clear that there is an urgent need for regulation of labelling of this industry in the form of a national standard for labelling of fertiliser products, which is actually what this motion proposes. As it currently stands, the industry is without accountability to consumers, most obviously with residential consumers, who rely completely on information available on the packaging of the product and on anecdotal evidence available to them. The percentages of the three active ingredients in fertiliser products-phosphorous, potassium and nitrogen-are not currently required to be defined on labelling. However, the percentages of these ingredients, when combined with the factors of soil pH and the type of plant, require varying amounts of these active ingredients to prosper. Without detailed labelling consumers are simply not in a position to effectively determine what is appropriate for their specific requirements. These choices often turn into a trial and error process in determining what products will be effective for their prize roses, backyard lawns or veggie gardens. Consumers should not have to risk using a fertiliser product that is so completely unsuited to their needs and risk damaging their plants in the process. Information about the composition of the fertiliser, the pH levels and the types of plants it is suited to should all be provided to the consumer through detailed labelling on the product itself. As a country, we have a national regulation requirement for products in many categories. Why should fertiliser products be different or have any less uniform labelling than these? has expired, as I understand it. In fact, I do apologise to the member for Longman. There has been a malfunction in the clock. The honourable member for Longman continues to have the call. continue. I freely admit that I do not have a strong personal understanding of the complex and varied nuances of soil balances and fertiliser composition. However, coming from a farming family, I do understand the importance of maintaining excellent soil quality and using all means necessary to achieve and maintain high soil quality. I also understand that, unlike residential consumers, farmers have access to extensive advice from government departments, agricultural consultants and professional soil testing, all of which guide farmers on their choice of fertilisers according to the specific needs of their local environment. Residential gardeners, local small business landscapers and gardeners themselves do not have access to any of this detailed information. Rather, their advice comes from the hardware sales assistant or perhaps a neighbour or a friend. Detailed labelling for these products is then, for obvious reasons, very significant. The call for a national standard and more detailed labelling on these products goes beyond providing consumers with adequate information. MAIN COMMITTEE",222,Private Members Business
312,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Peter Slipper,"Order! The honourable member's timeThese products are purchased by and large by individuals who are recreational gardeners with little understanding and experience of using hazardous chemicals and composting materials. Detailed and consistent information is essential to ensure the personal health and safety of these consumers when using fertiliser products. As a community, we are striving for sustainable and healthy living and we endeavour to make positive changes in our lives to achieve these qualities. Organic fertilisers are considered to be environmentally and ecologically safe, and their use should be encouraged. All fertilisers need to be handled with caution. All individuals who handle these products need to be made aware of the possible risks and hazards involved with these products in order to make appropriate decisions and take appropriate precautions-for instance, using masks and gloves. These conditions may be particularly dangerous for the health of those individuals with pre-existing lung conditions or immunodeficiencies as they are particularly susceptible to contracting bacterial infections from strains of nocardia or similar bacteria. Consumers need to be informed about the risk of these products, which is only possible through the employment of consistent and detailed labelling-labelling which identifies what safety precautions need to be taken before, during and after the handling of these products. It is interesting to note that Australians on average spend over 20 minutes each day caring for their pets and gardens. Clearly this is a significant Australian recreational activity, and every effort should be made to provide clarity and consistency of information. This is why I support this motion, a motion that is calling for a uniform national standard for the labelling of fertiliser products and prescribing the appropriate composition of active ingredients in fertiliser products. Ms HALL (Shortland-Government Whip) (11:26): It gives me great pleasure to speak on this motion concerning a national standard for fertiliser products. It is interesting that the opposition, who always argue against mandatory standards, are bringing a motion before this parliament requesting that mandatory standards be put in place. The opposition are supposed to be friends of business, but if they were the friends of business they should be aware that by putting this regulatory burden on business they would be increasing the cost of doing business and making it harder for business. I question whether they are really the friends of business. This motion shows that the people who really listen to the needs of business are on this side of the parliament. I am fresh from being back in my electorate. My husband did gardening at the weekend and part of that gardening involved fertilising plants. I was not in the garden with him as the lifestyle of a member of parliament means that we do not get too much time to enjoy being outdoors looking after our plants. The reason I am talking about his contribution to our garden is that he approaches it in the way that I think all people approach gardening. He knew that he needed to put some fertiliser on the lawn so he went to the local store to purchase the required fertiliser. He talked about what he needed to fertilise with the shop assistant working there. He was given a breakdown of the types of fertiliser that were included and he took the advice of a well-trained sales assistant who knew the right kind of fertiliser to use on the lawn, the plants and the vegetables. He walked away with a few bags of fertiliser and was ready to work in the garden. I know that in a couple of months we will see the reward of his finding out about the right kind of fertiliser to use. The member for Longman talked about using masks and gloves. I think any sensible gardener uses masks and gloves. My husband was in the MAIN COMMITTEE garden wearing a mask and his gloves. SoI would encourage all consumers to do what Lindsay did: make inquiries of the merchant about whether a product is fit for the purpose for which it is to be used. This does not apply only to fertiliser products. We use many commodities in our daily lives. If you have a doubt about anything, check to see whether it will be appropriate for the intended use. I am very careful about what I eat. A number of people have allergies to foodfor example, to peanuts. We, as consumers, go out of our way to work out what is in those products. If a person is not sure about the product-this goes to every product we use, not only fertilisers-then the golden rule is to ask. If you cannot find out, do not use it. If you are not comfortable with it, do not use it. Under the Australian Consumer Law, the ACL, consumers have protection. Under the ACL, consumer guarantees cover any types of goods and services costing up to $40,000 sold in trade and commerce. As members of parliament, it is our role to ensure that consumers are aware of this guarantee. This provides a safety net to all consumers. Consumer guarantees allow consumers to seek redress if the goods they are provided with are not fit for the purpose specified by the consumer. There is also a voluntary product safety standard in place; that is AS4454-2003-the Australian standard for composts, soil conditioners and mulches-which includes guidance on a required PH level. This motion calls for us to move away from voluntary standards-the voluntary standards that those on the other side of this parliament always argue in favour of-to mandatory standards. Any product that purports to meet the voluntary standard but is found not to meet the standard risks breaching the misleading representation provision of the Australian Consumer Law and people could face significant penalties. I have been involved in the voluntary standards that relate to breastfeeding, which is quite a different area. Members on the other side of this parliament argued very strongly against mandatory standards in that area. Members on the other side of this parliament also argued very strongly against mandatory standards in relation to food labelling. They argued that the best way to achieve it is by a voluntary industry standard. But in relation to the motion before us today, the opposition is arguing that the government should move away from voluntary standards in the area of fertilisers whilst keeping in place voluntary standards in those other areas-areas which are very important to the health and safety of our community. So there are double standards involved in today's motion. The reason for the member moving this motion in parliament is not apparent to me. I have heard him argue against mandatory standards in other areas. His colleagues on the other side of this parliament argue against mandatory standards. As I said in the beginning, a call for mandatory standards would increase the regulatory burden and the cost for business, something that those on the other side of the House obviously have no qualms about doing. Again, they would have to go out and explain to their business constituency how they can justify this increased cost to and regulatory burden on them. Any additional increase in cost ultimately increases the cost to consumers. We need to be certain that there is widespread concern that would justify making consumers pay more. This motion is really about increasing the cost to business, increasing the cost to consumers and therefore increasing daily living expenses-something that those on the other side of this parliament do not mind doing. If there is evidence that there is a widespread problem then I urge the members on the other side to consult with the government and, MAIN COMMITTEE further, with the states and territories and the fair trading regulators to determine whether or not further regulation is needed. between all compost standards and the government regulations which override them. A review completed by Robyn Neesen of Yanco in the Riverina highlights anomalies between compost standards in federal and state regulations. The report refers particularly to contaminant levels and the need for action to ensure a high-standard product which will improve soil health and productivity. There are currently no compulsory guidelines prescribing the quality of compost sold to recreational gardeners for private and domestic use. Many gardeners, be gardening their livelihood or just a hobby, have no way of knowing if the fertiliser they are purchasing will do more damage than good to their plants. In the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries winter edition newsletter, the main article was headed 'When compost ain't compost'. It was a telling heading and an interesting piece. When it comes to compost, things are not always as they ought to be. Mrs Griggs: Really? is an absolutely interesting subject and one that is very important. While this might not seem important in the overall scheme of issues on the national agenda at present, it is something which, if passed, will ensure consistency and uniformity in an area in which many people participate. Gardening is one of Australia's most popular pastimes. I am sure the member for Solomon probably spent the weekend in the garden when she was not busy taking care of her constituents-as she does, because she is a very good local member. A nice garden shows that people take pride in their most important investment: their home. I am sure the member for Bendigo probably spent his weekend in the garden, too. A working garden produces fresh fruit and vegetables-so crucial to healthy living. Australians love gardening. From the very enthusiastic gardener who spends every waking moment either thinking about or actually mulching and tilling their back yard, to the very casual fellow who phoned in his thoughts about rugby league to Sydney radio station 2GB's continuous call team yesterday while enjoying a quiet drink and pulling out a weed or two to make out he was working hard in the garden, Aussies love working with plants in the great outdoors. You also only have to look at the number of gardening shows and 'do-it-yourself' programs that are so popular on television and radio to realise the emphasis Australians put on gardening. On average, Australians spend 22 minutes per day on grounds and animal care, which includes the work of many conscientious gardeners. That equates to about 134 hours per year that the average Australian may be spending tending to their garden, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Those are 2006 figures, I might add; the statistics, I feel, would actually be increased in 2011 and will increase beyond that. Gardening is enjoyed greatly by Australia's seniors, and so it becomes even more important given that we have an ageing population. With no standard or requirement to prescribe the ingredient levels of fertilisers made available for private or domestic sale, residential gardeners cannot possibly know if the fertiliser they are purchasing will do more harm than good to their precious MAIN COMMITTEE",225,Wyatt Roy Mr Deputy Speaker. I Would Always Respect Your Ruling But I Will
313,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (11:36,An urgent need exists to address inconsistencies,228,Wyatt Roy Mr Deputy Speaker. I Would Always Respect Your Ruling But I Will
314,Mr Mccormack,"Yes, really, Member for Solomon, and I will continue, because thisplants. Fertiliser is not cheap, so people should know what they are getting. Those who work in gardening stores and compost supply companies are not always aware nor do they have the time on all occasions to explain all the details about the products. Plants are not inexpensive either and gardeners need to know that what they are growing them in or sustaining them with is what will be best for the plants. Robyn Neeson's recent review entitled Compost comparison: organic standards AS 4454: the need for consistent, high quality compost standards and regulations, reported that regulations of consistency are paramount for organic and conventional agriculture. She emphasised what anyone who knows anything about improving soil quality has known all along-that is, that farmers are encouraged to use organic compost to improve soil health and to sequester carbon. However, the inconsistencies make it difficult for users to assess the quality of the product and ensure its suitability for use. Earlier this year, Ms Neeson exhibited a poster and submitted a paper to an international symposium on compost use in horticulture. She has reviewed the three Australian organic standards for their compost requirements: Organic and Biodynamic Products, AS 6000-2009; Australian Certified Organic Australian Organic Standard 2006; and National Association for Sustainable Agriculture Australia Organic Standard 2008. All organic standards reviewed concurred that organic certification standards should restrict compost inputs to natural materials such as animal and plant wastes, and naturally mined minerals and trace elements. Both the Australian Certified Organic standard and the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture Australia standard prohibit the use of biosolids on food crops, but AS 6000-2009 made no reference to biosolids. It is a requirement of all organic standards that they also comply with relevant government regulations. Ms Neeson found that the levels of contaminants acceptable in organic farming standards varied between standards. She reported compost is a primary source of nutrients in organic farming systems and the higher levels permitted by some organic standards for elements such as zinc presumably aim to reflect this requirement. In some instances, ambiguous terms such as 'none or low level', AS 6000-2009, and 'not containing synthetic chemicals', ACO, are used in preference to precise limits. This is not about the information on the back of compost packs not being right and not giving quite all the information, and thus being an impost on businesses; this is about giving the correct information to consumersinformation that they need and rightly should expect given the fact that they are spending so much money on fertilisers and composts. Australian Standard Composts, soil conditioners and mulches, AS 4454-2003, specifies physical, chemical, biological and labelling requirements for composts. In addition, all products and their application must comply with federal and state regulations. The standard also details the best-practice guidelines for composting. The AS 4454-2003 permits the use of organic materials, including biosolids as feedstock ingredients. Mixtures of organic waste which contain non-organic materials are permitted-for example, plastic, glass and metal from household waste-but restrictions are placed on the proportion and size of these contaminants. All compost standards, organic and AS, defer to federal or state regulations with regard to minimum standards in feedstock material, application techniques and contaminant levelsheavy metals, organic contaminants and pathogens. The review also found that these MAIN COMMITTEE regulations varied across state jurisdictions. It is time to get this sorted. We need a national standard for fertiliser products. This motion will enable that. We heard only last week in parliament of the importance of precious petals. The Prime Minister must be a keen gardener for she is obviously aware of the need to take care of our precious petals because she raised it during Tuesday's proceedings. This motion will take care of precious petals as well as all other plants which benefit from compost and fertiliser. Moreover, it will put in place safeguards for gardeners and heighten their knowledge of the product they are buying and using, something which should be stated consumer information. I implore the government to help pass this legislation. important matter before the chamber which has been put forward by the member for Sturt. This motion comes in good time as spring is almost upon us, when it is a nice warm day here in Canberra and when it was certainly a warm weekend in Brisbane. This is the time when we should be applying 'Weed and Feed' to our lawns and fertilising our gardens in preparation for the growing seasons. Unfortunately, one of the downsides of this job is that my garden does not always get the attention it deserves. But this motion has, at the very least, prompted me to turn some attention to my garden in the coming weeks. The member for Sturt is right. Like most products, fertilisers can be used in the wrong way and occasionally with damaging results. I once heard a story of a bloke-I am pretty sure he was a constituent-who was gifted a square of grass from the Gabba cricket ground, because now they drop in ovals and the like and they do resurfacing. And so precious was this grass, especially in Queensland, that he took it home, planted it in his backyard, nurtured it, watered it and, for those cricket and Aussie Rules fans, developed his own piece of the Gabba or his own slice of history. When he moved house years later, he dug up a sample of the grass so that he could take it to his new property so that he had a little slice of the Gabba at his new home. However, the next year he went to fertilise his precious lawn that he had taken with him as he moved house but, instead of applying fertiliser, he poisoned it with something like Roundup. Therefore, he ended up killing his own backyard piece of the Gabba forever. It just goes to show that you can make mistakes in applying simple fertilisers. It makes me wonder what has prompted this motion from the member for Sturt. Has he had a strange or a bad experience in his garden? Has he been exposed to too much manure? Mr Gibbons: Or is he a precious petal? Member for Bendigo. Has he applied the wrong fertiliser and inadvertently killed his hydrangeas? Who knows? I hope not, for his sake. Nevertheless, Australia certainly uses a lot of fertiliser. Each year Australians apply between five and six million tonnes, obviously, mostly in farming but a lot is still applied to domestic gardens. We export up to 400,000 tonnes of fertiliser a year. Any fertilisers imported into Australia must meet strict quarantine requirements for maximum permissible concentrations of certain impurities. All states already have rules regarding the labelling of fertilisers and that is obviously appropriate. These labels concern appropriate use and application guidelines. Fertiliser labels generally must include the name of the fertiliser, the quantity by weight or by volume, the name and full business address of the wholesaler and all the relevant warnings, particularly MAIN COMMITTEE",228,Wyatt Roy Mr Deputy Speaker. I Would Always Respect Your Ruling But I Will
315,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (11:44,It is with great pride that I stand to talk about this,230,Wyatt Roy Mr Deputy Speaker. I Would Always Respect Your Ruling But I Will
316,Mr Perrett,"I take that interjection, but I am talking garden wise not policy wise,about safe handling and all those other occupational health and safety requirements that we need to be aware of. The gentleman I mentioned earlier, who perhaps could have saved his Gabba turf had he simply read the label or asked for advice from the staff at his local hardware store, particularly if it is a small hardware store rather than one of those big megastores. If in doubt, consumers need to make inquires at the place of purchase about the best product for their desired purpose. If a customer is given the wrong advice, then obviously they are protected under normal consumer law protections. All consumers are able to seek redress if the goods they buy are not suitable for the purpose that was advertised. In Queensland, this would be as per the Sale of Goods Act, and there is similar legislation throughout Australia. I understand that these consumer guarantees cover goods and services up to the value of $40,000. It would be hard, though, to compensate or replace the original Gabba turf-it is not the sort of thing that you would go to court to receive recompense for-or, if you are a Victorian, a piece of the McG or whatever your particular piece of special grass. I do appreciate the concerns of the member for Sturt. However, I think there is a little bit of hypocrisy here. He does not come in here and talk about a national curriculum to drive improvement to our children's education. He does not believe in national education standards for our children but, through this motion that he has introduced, he has shown that he is very passionate about establishing a national standard for fertiliser and compost products. I guess that, sometimes in politics, you just have to follow your heart. Australia already has a voluntary safety standard in place: AS4454. The Australian standards for compost, soil conditioners and mulches include guidance on the required pH levels so that you can guide even a novice gardener like me through to what is required. Significant penalties can apply where a product that claims to meet Australian Standard 4454 yet does not. This may breach the misleading representations provisions of the Australian consumer law. Obviously it is difficult to enforce these things, especially if you are just a normal suburban gardener-it is not the sort of thing you would probably rush off to the courts to enforce but there still are those protections there. The member for Sturt may have more people going through his electorate door who are keen to talk about compost. However, I have only been in parliament for about four years and I think I could say that I have not had anyone come to my office, write to me, email me or make contact in any way to talk about fertiliser labelling or excessive pH levels in these products. Lots of people have come to talk to me about carbon levels, but never about the pH levels in the products. They are concerned about the impact if the opposition votes against the Carbon Farming Initiative-a lot of people have spoken to me about that but never about pH levels, but I live and wait. I do understand that when government increases regulation the compliance costs will in turn increase for business, and obviously consumers will lose out in the end through increased product costs. As there is currently no widespread community concern, we simply cannot justify making consumers foot the bill for what, on the surface, would appear to be quite an unnecessary government regulation. However, if the member for Sturt does have evidence of a widespread problem in the fertiliser and compost industry, the government will talk to the state and territory fair trading regulators. That would be the more appropriate body to regulate this because, as I said, there is already an established process. MAIN COMMITTEE We have paid a lot of attention to fertiliser over the years after we saw the amazing situation a few years back in the United States where a building was blown up by people inappropriately using fertiliser so now it is much more controlled. There is a much healthier approach to what fertiliser should be sold and where it should be sold. I would suggest to the member for Sturt-and I am not sure if he is the best gardener in the world or not, if he has time for that-that he turn instead to the state and territory fair trading regulators and the approaches they have to controlling the fertiliser industry. As I said earlier, now is the time-with September upon us and the equinox this weekwhen people will be turning to their gardens in the school holidays or in their spare time and they will be able to decide how best to use their fertiliser to improve their gardens. Obviously it would be much more appropriate to do that by consultation with the person who sells them the fertiliser rather than by being concerned with the motion put forward by the member for Sturt. I have a lot more faith in our state and territory fair trading regulators and I am sure that they will be able to work out what is needed to be done in this area, and they are best placed to assess any need for further labelling regulations.

National Police Remembrance Day Debate resumed on motion by Mr Hayes: That this House: (1) recognises and acknowledges the significant contribution that officers across all Australian policing jurisdictions make to our local communities as we approach National Police Remembrance Day on 29 September 2011; (2) remembers and commemorates the ultimate sacrifices made by all police officers who have been killed in the course of their duties, in particular, that we commemorate the lives of: (a) Detective Constable William Arthur George (Bill) Crews of the NSW Police Force who was killed in Sydney on 9 September 2010; (b) Sergeant Daniel Stiller of the Queensland Police Force who was killed on 1 December 2010; and (c) Detective Sergeant Constable Damian Leeding of the Queensland Police Force who was killed on 1 June 2011; (3) honours the courage, commitment and memory of the many fine men and women who lost their lives during the execution of their official duty made in serving our community; (4) pays respect to the work of Police Legacy which undertakes vital services in looking after the families and friends of the fallen police officers; and (5) supports and thanks all serving police throughout Australia for their invaluable dedication and commitment to make a difference, defend our way of life and safeguard our communities. September. This day holds an especially significant position in the national police calendar. It is at this time we pause to honour the lives and memory of many fine men and women who, in serving their community, have had their lives tragically cut short in the execution of their duty. National Police Remembrance Day is a significant occasion for police and the general community to gather to reflect on the invaluable service and commitment rendered by our police. It also is an opportunity to remember those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice while they go about their normal day-to-day duty of serving our community.

317,Mr Hayes (Fowler) (11:53,"National Police Remembrance Day is observed on 29The National Police Remembrance Day is observed on St Michael's Day. St Michael is the patron saint of police and, according to Christian tradition, the protector of good over evil. This year we recall the tragic deaths of three fine police officers: Detective Constable William 'Bill' Crews, who was tragically shot during a drug raid in the south-west of Sydney while attached to the Middle Eastern crime squad; Sergeant Daniel Stiller, who died near Mount Larcom in Queensland while riding a police motor cycle on official escort duties; and Detective Senior Constable Damian Leeding, who was shot during an armed robbery on the Gold Coast. The National Police Memorial, which is located in Kings Park on the northern side of Lake Burley Griffin, preserves the memory of the 749 police officers around Australia who have been killed on duty or have died as a result of their duties since 1803 when Constable Joseph Luker was killed in Sydney. The memorial, in a very solemn and respectful way, captures the qualities such as courage, duty and integrity shown by every one of our fallen police officers. When visiting the National Police Memorial, there is one thing that is impossible to ignore: that is the number of blank plaques. They are there for those officers who, sadly, will join their colleagues in the years to come. It is a stark reminder of the unique nature of policing and the dangers faced by police in protecting our community. Last SaturdayI joined with more than 1,200 police officers and their supporters in the Wall to Wall Ride for Remembrance. The police commissioners from New South Wales, the Northern Territory, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Federal Police also participated in the ride, with the remaining commissioners joining the gathering when we all assembled at the National Police Memorial in Kings Park. Apart from commemorating fallen colleagues, the ride is a major charity effort. Importantly, the funds raised from the ride will go to Police Legacy to support the partners and children of officers who have been killed on duty. I know policing comes with a degree of risk that, thankfully, most of us will never in our lives have to face. Through my close association with policing over many years, and having grown up in a police family, I understand that it takes a special type of person and a special type of courage to wear the police uniform. We are truly indebted to the men and women who choose to do so. My father was a member of the New South Wales Police Force, with a career that spanned 34 years. He retired as an inspector and an officer in charge of police communications. When I spoke at his funeral two weeks ago, I recalled the conversation I had with him when I was young when I asked: what motivated him to join the police, given the risks, the dangers and the sacrifices associated with police work? I am sure what he told me then reflects the views of every police officer, including Bill Crews, Daniel Stiller and Damian Leeding. My dad told me he joined the police force to make a difference. Today is also the day we remember the loved ones of all those police officers who have been killed, people whose lives have been affected forever with the passing of a partner, a father, a mother, a sibling, a workmate, a friend or a colleague. We should never forget the families of those who have given their lives for the protection of our community. I particularly commend the work of Police Legacy. Today is also a historic day for policing, with the Prime Minister awarding the first of the National Police Service Medals to 16 police officers selected from each of our state and territory jurisdictions and the Australian Federal Police. Commissioners from each of the MAIN COMMITTEE jurisdictions participated in today's event. Once again, it is a reminder of the good work, dedication and commitment shown by all our police officers. The function was also attended by the President of the Police Federation of Australia, Vince Kelly, and representatives from each of the police associations and unions from around the country. In the short time. I have got available I will also mention that we have here today in the public gallery Detective Inspector Brian Rix. Brian was part of today's medal presentation. He was also one of the instigators of the Wall to Wall Ride for Remembrance. Brian recently retired from the Victorian police force and was President of the Police Association Victoria. In the time that he has served the people of Victoria, he served in the homicide squad, drug squad, armed robbery squad, special response group, tactical investigations squad and many others. He had a career that spanned 35 years. Looking after Victorian police came with his role as president of the association. Looking after police across the country and serving the memory of the fallen came from his commitment to doing something positive, such as the Wall to Wall Ride. I wish him all the best in retirement, as I do Shirley, as they embark upon a new and different set of challenges. One thing I do know is that police genuinely care. Streets in Melbourne are far safer through the diligence and commitment of Brian Rix and people like him. I also see, sitting behind Brian, retired Commander Max Pope, who I have known for a long time in the Northern Territory. I am not sure of the length of his career in the Northern Territory. He has certainly been there far longer than I have been involved in national policing. I acknowledge the role he played and the dedication he showed in the Northern Territory Police. I would like to conclude with the police ode. This is to all of those serving police members across Australia to show that we do appreciate the genuine difference they make in our community. On behalf of a grateful community, not only do I say thank you, but I recite the ode: As the sun surely sets, dawn will see it arise, for service above self demands its own prize. You have fought the good fight, life's race has been run, and peace your reward, for eternity begun. And we that are left shall never forget, rest in peace friend and colleague, for the sun has now set. We will remember. Hasten the dawn. for Fowler. I also acknowledge the significant contribution that officers across all Australian MAIN COMMITTEE",232,Wyatt Roy Mr Deputy Speaker. I Would Always Respect Your Ruling But I Will
318,Mrs Griggs (Solomon) (12:03,"I rise to support the motion put forward by the memberpolicing jurisdictions make to our community as we approach National Police Remembrance Day on 29 September 2011. I acknowledge the National Police Memorial here in Canberra, which has, as the Member for Fowler said, the names of 749 police officers recorded on it. These police forfeited their lives in the service of the community. Although there are members of the Northern Territory Police Force recorded on the monument, it is significant to note that Northern Territory Police Force has been indeed fortunate not to have had to acknowledge the supreme sacrifice of any additional members in the past 12 months. The Northern Territory, by its nature, is demanding upon its police. I firmly believe that there could be no finer, more committed group of men and women than those involved in law enforcement in the Northern Territory. They have my respect and support. As I have said many times in this place, I am a long-term resident of the Northern Territory, having grown up in Alice Springs and having lived all of my adult life in Darwin. This, coupled with being the wife of a Northern Territory police officer, has put me in a position to know first hand the impact that policing has had, not only on society but on members of the police force and their families. Like many members would, I remember the days when police officers held an automatic position of status within the community. I certainly recall the days when the local cop was part of the community and continually engaging with it. It was when there was respect for the officer within that community. It was the tone of law enforcement that moulded the way the community was. I recall the days when the local police officer was respected and had the support of the community to deal with issues at a local level. They knew the kids, they knew where they were, what they were up to and, if necessary, they would give them a clip behind the ear before sending them home-knowing that mum and dad would be told about their activities which, in most cases, resulted in any penalty or punishment being meted out at home and not in the courts, where often little or nothing occurs. Yes, times have changed. Society has moved forward and continued to develop. But I think at times this movement has not necessarily been for its betterment. We live in a community in which people show little or no respect for each other, let alone for their police. In some communities our police are in many cases simply a service provider; faceless uniforms dealing with the outcomes of a slow social decay-decay that is evident across all the demographics of society. Where are the days of being able to leave your house unlocked, your car open in the street? Today is a far cry from what I saw no more than 20 years ago. Not only do we have to lock our doors; there is the requirement to install an increasing array of security measures. A locked door was once all that was needed; now we talk of security screens, motion sensors, home alarms and, in some cases, panic rooms. What happened to the front yard being a place where the local kids could meet and kick a footy? What happened to knowing your neighbours, engaging with your neighbours, sharing a story over the back fence? Sadly today increasingly neighbours do not engage. Front yards are examples of modern fencing often supported by the chorus of barking dogs. Our police officers today are servants to a community that can at times view them as the opposition, an object to taunt or a game. I suppose I should ask why we expect those elements MAIN COMMITTEE of the community who do not even respect themselves to respect our police. In addition, police officers on the street are often hamstrung by ineffective legislation that puts the balance in the hands of the offenders and severely limits the capacity of police to respond effectively to the demands of our community. In days gone by our police were proactive. As I have said, they knew their communities because they were out engaging with the community: visiting businesses, talking to the owners, walking the streets and meeting the people, attending community meetings, dropping by the local school and engaging with the kids. They were the coach of the local footy team or ran the local police club. The local police officer was known as a police officer regardless of what their role was within the community or how they were dressed. It was never just the uniform; it was the person inside who made an effective police officer. In the Northern Territory Aboriginal communities, particularly those in the Arnhem Land region but also in others, the police officer was often called the 'jarmon'. They were a respected member of the Aboriginal community and placed in a family group by that community. The 'jarmon' was respected regardless of their mode of dress and whether they were on or off duty was not a concept ever to be considered. A long-serving police officer and my friend Max Pope, who is here with me today, has served 35 years in the Northern Territory police force. He has spent many years serving across the Northern Territory including many in remote communities. He was telling me that after hearing the term 'jarmon' being whispered amongst the people he one day asked one of the elders, 'What does that term mean?' He was told that when non-Aboriginal police officers came to the Territory there was a need to have them placed in the family so that their place could be known to the community. More significantly, the term referred to a person who feared nothing, a person who would walk into a camp of armed tribesman and exert their will to enforce the law. It was said that the old people were amazed that anyone could be so cheeky and fearless. The Northern Territory is a collection of communities and, in most, people know who their police officers are. In this environment a police officer is a police officer regardless of whether he or she is in or out of uniform, on or off duty. Those who may be critical, criticising a member for taking actions in a social environment, are usually the same people who would be critical where a member fails to respond to a breach of the law regardless of the police officer's duty status at the time. The focus of society, driven by the changing face of politics, is governed more by the 24-hour news cycle and the voice of minority groups than by the governance required to build better communities. Our courts continually demonstrate the spiral of police importance and status within the community. Increasingly, court records demonstrate examples of language and behaviour brought to answer which the court determines as acceptable in terms of such language or behaviour police should expect and deem as acceptable in the course of their normal duties. We regularly see reports of offenders brought before the court to answer allegations of assault or injury to police, only to see the offender dealt with by a slap on the wrist. Not only does this result further undermine the value and importance of our police services, it adds weight in the minds of those who perpetrate such acts, the ramifications of these behaviours mean nothing. In some cases this behaviour is now seen as a rite of passage or a badge of honour. MAIN COMMITTEE The responsibilities placed upon our police members are ever increasing. We expect our police to act as social garbage collectors without definite mechanisms to deal with or address these issues from an ongoing perspective. The real truth of the matter is, policing the community is expensive. Governments of all persuasions grapple with how to provide value policing against a backdrop of increased costs and reduced budgets. As we all know, the wheels of change in terms of good governance move slowly. Meanwhile, the face of change in the community is occurring at a rate rapidly outpacing our capacity to identify, prioritise, develop and implement the change that is needed. From the perspective of the Northern Territory, statistically we have one of the highest rates of police officer representation to head of population. Look at the Northern Territory demographically; it is a remote locality with a small total population. There are only two centres of significant populace; the remainder are spread far and wide across the expanse of the Northern Territory. Our police officers are in many respects the most capable, diverse and resilient of police personnel. They work in a culturally diverse community, in many instances miles and hours from any level of backup support. They deal with a greater cross-section of offences than most general duties officers of similar comparative experience outside the Northern Territory. Our police are some of the best; a small police force in number, but one where the importance of bond and police brother/sisterhood remain strong. It is a police force where the loss of a member is heartfelt and resonates across all levels of the force. It is felt within the community and in many respects is felt as deeply in those communities as within the force. I applaud and support any action to recognise police officers across the country. Police Remembrance Day is a day of significance and importance to police officers within my home in the Northern Territory, and indeed Australia. Remembrance Day is a day to honour and remember fallen colleagues. Certainly, within the Northern Territory we have been fortunate. Increasingly and sadly, though, each year the list of police names recalled and remembered on this day increases. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (12:14): TodayI rise to speak in support of the National Police Remembrance Day motion moved by the member for Fowler, and it is my pleasure to second the motion. On Thursday, 8 September, dozens of Queensland police officers commenced a 1,400 kilometre motorbike journey to Canberra for the Wall to Wall Ride for Remembrance. Their journey was to remember those lost in the line of duty and to raise awareness for Australian police legacies. Today, I rise to do the same. This House remembers and commemorates the ultimate sacrifices made by our police officers and we particularly seek to remember those whom we have lost over the last 12 months-the lives of Detective Constable William Arthur George Crews of the NSW Police Force who was killed in Sydney on 9 September 2010; Sergeant Daniel Stiller of the Queensland Police Service who was killed on 1 December 2010; and most recently Detective Sergeant Constable Damian Leeding of the Queensland Police Service who was killed on 1 June 2011. On 20 June this year, I stood before this House to offer my condolences to the family of Senior Constable Damian Leeding, whose tragic loss in the line of duty rocked the Australian public and reminded us all of the sacrifice our officers and their families make. In the lead-up to National Police Remembrance Day, nothing makes me prouder than to stand here again MAIN COMMITTEE and extend my gratitude to all those who have served and continue to serve to protect our community. I also wish to express my sincere condolences to the wives, husbands, mothers, fathers, sons and daughters, partners and bureaus of Australian police force who have suffered the devastation of a life cut short in the line of duty. I am the proud wife of a police officer who has served the Queensland Police Service for more than 17 years. I have spent nights waiting and worrying when he does not come home on time. I have seen him come home with bruises and blood on him. I have heard the stories of him being spat on and yelled abuse at when trying to help the injured or victims of crime. If only every person in the Australian society could spend a day in the shoes of a serving police officer, we would see that respect returned to our serving police officers. We should acknowledge that the role of our police officers is not just to react to incidents. We should also acknowledge the positive work that they do to help educate our seniors and to educate people in our community about how to stay safer. Importantly, I have to say how proud I am of the work being done in recent years on youth crime prevention. I talk to a lot of the local police officers in my electorate of Petrie who are doing amazing work trying to help our youth straighten out their lives and hopefully stay out of prison. We know that we are going to be remembering 749 lives lost this year. Queensland has lost 139 police officers in the line of duty and National Police Remembrance Day gives us a day to pause, reflect and honour the officers whose lives were cut short. It is also a time to say thank you to the work of the Police Legacy who assists the families of the police officers killed in the line of duty. Currently Queensland Police Legacy supports 45 families, including meeting the educational expenses of 77 dependent legatee children. This support and that offered by other Police Legacy branches across the country to ensure families have the emotional and financial assistance they need in the wake of tragedy cannot be overstated. For their invaluable work, I say thank you. As a wife of a policeman, I understand the dangers our officers face every day as our protectors and our heroes. It is for this reason that I stand here to offer my condolences and gratitude to the officers and the families who have sacrificed for our community. I ask that the House and the Australian people take a moment to honour their sacrifice in the lead-up to National Police Remembrance Day. I would like to acknowledge the member for Fowler for all the work he does in relation to the serving police officers across the country and also to acknowledge those members who are speaking on this motion today. I ask the Australian people that, on 29 September 2011, they stop and remember just for a moment the great work that our past and current serving police officers do and to acknowledge, most importantly, those who have lost their lives and their families. Police Remembrance Day on 29 September. I have also had the great honour to serve as a sworn member of the Australian Federal Police and, while that was only for a couple of years back in the 1980s, I do recall seeing enough of the realities of life in Australia to know that the risks that sworn officers, police in uniform and plain clothes detectives, take are very grave indeed. So often society is a little bit negative towards police until such time as a person on the street feels a personal threat-at which point they are very glad to see that blue MAIN COMMITTEE",234,Wyatt Roy Mr Deputy Speaker. I Would Always Respect Your Ruling But I Will
319,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (12:19,"I rise to speak on the motion on the coming Nationaluniform. It is always the case that when the public needs uniformed police they call and call very loudly. In Western Australia. I am honoured to have a number of excellent officers and stations around my area. We have got Wanneroo Police Station and Warwick Police Station and also a very active crime prevention team within the north-western district of the Western Australian police in the urban areas. Looking back over events of the last few years, we have had a couple of pretty bad incidents in Western Australia. There was a very grievous attack on Constable Matthew Butcher, though it did not cost him his life. It was a completely unreasonable and dastardly attack, where he was assaulted from behind with a flying head butt. As a result he was very seriously injured and will probably have to live with those injuries for the rest of his life. That is a great tragedy. What is really required is respect from members of the public. Unfortunately, there are a lot of terrible people out there who see the police as a problem for their normal activities, and I guess we will always have criminals. But, in the case of Constable Butcher, what made it worse was that there was no attempt to confront him, only an attempt to take him out from behind. That was a terrible thing. As a result of that, the state government in Western Australia has taken a very firm line on assaults against public officers, which is resulting in jail terms. I think that is entirely appropriate. I would go so far as to say that not only should assault of police officers come with a jail term upon guilt being found, but that swearing at police officers should also require specific action to remind people that it is unacceptable. I would also like to talk briefly about Constable Damien Murphy, who died on 15 February 2007. Constable Murphy, having just dealt with a domestic violence incident in the suburb of Craigie, tried to flag down a vehicle on one of the major roads and was struck by that vehicle. This was a real tragedy-he was a young bloke with a young family who left behind a wifebut these things unfortunately happen when police officers put their lives on the line for community safety. It is important that state jurisdictions in particular take a very firm stand against assault or abuse of police officers to make sure they are protected as much as possible, to look after them when they are putting their lives on the line for the community. I say, 'Thank God they are there; thank God there is someone out there willing to stand up and be counted and do these things.' I wish them well and hopefully there will be no more of these assaults. doing so, can I commend the member for Fowler for bringing it to the attention of the House. I know he has spoken in the past about the importance of our police around the country and he is committed to the work that they do. As I have said, I commend him for bringing this motion to the House and for his speech earlier on. Earlier today the member for Fowler, a number of others and I attended the presentation of police medals by the Prime Minister to the first 16 recipients of that medal. Firstly, I say congratulations to all the recipients of those medals at today's presentation. Officers from around the country were there and it was good to see the different states and territories represented at the presentation. I particularly congratulate the South Australian recipients of the medal, Sergeant Bill Bampton and Senior Constable Jessie Hughes, who I met for the first MAIN COMMITTEE",238,Wyatt Roy Mr Deputy Speaker. I Would Always Respect Your Ruling But I Will
320,Mr Zappia (Makin) (12:24,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and, intime this morning and who I know are very worthy recipients of the medal and will do the medal proud. I also congratulate South Australian Police Commissioner Mal Hyde who, on behalf of his commissioner colleagues, addressed the gathering. As a fellow South Australian and as I know Commissioner Hyde, it was good to see him standing up there, representing the national police commissioners from around Australia, and also to hear his words. He spoke very well. He was very well supported as well by the South Australian Police Association President, Mark Carroll, and the state secretary of the association Andy Dunn, who is in the gallery with us here today and I acknowledge his presence. BeforeI go on to my other remarks, I also acknowledge the 42 South Australian police riders who participated in the 1,230-strong motorcycle contingent to Canberra in the Wall-to-Wall Ride for Remembrance. I am sure for them it would have been both an enjoyable ride and a very long ride from Adelaide to Canberra. I thought the Prime Minister, in her address this morning, spoke eloquently and she covered all of the important comments that needed to be made in respect to this motion and the work of our serving police officers around the country. Essentially, she made the point that every day some 56,000 police officers around the country leave their home to go out to work not knowing what to expect, not knowing if they are going to return home safely. Simultaneously, their families see their loved ones leaving to go to work not knowing if they will see them come back at the end of the day and not knowing, if they do come back at the end of the day, if they will be in one piece-and so often that is not the case, and we have just heard the member for Petrie speaking about her personal experience with her partner. For them and their families it is a pretty tough ask to say that you are going to leave to go to work not knowing what to expect. For us in the rest of society, we get up and we do the same-we go to work-but we go with the comfort of knowing that we are relatively safe because of the work of police officers around the country. It is quite reassuring to have people out there doing exactly that so that we can get on with the rest of our lives in the way that we would like to do so. It is not just in respect to safety in the broader sense. Every day we are confronted with different crises from around the country, whether it is a crime scene, a motor vehicle accident or domestic violence and so on, and whenever there is a crisis who do we first call? The police, and we ask them to be there to try and reassure us, take control of the situation and get things back in order. It is a huge responsibility on the serving police officers of this country, as other speakers have said. In the brief time. I have left to me, I simply want to make a couple of points. On previous occasions I have spoken about some of the South Australian police officers who have been killed or injured in the line of duty and I have talked about Senior Constable Derrick McManus, who in 1994 was shot 14 times, and Senior Constable David Barr, who was killed at Salisbury in 1990. But today I want to very briefly talk about Constable Nathan Mulholland and Constable Tung Tran, who on 25 May 2010 were shot when they responded to a call for assistance at a residential address. The person who shot them actually called them to go to the home because he 'needed assistance' and when they got there he shot both of them without any reason at all. I know Constable Tran sustained a very serious head injury. That is the kind of job police officers are confronted with. I say to those police officers that 29 September is a day when we remember your services. It is fitting that the monument in Canberra has inscribed on it the name of each and every officer who has lost their life to protect ours. MAIN COMMITTEE is important that we acknowledge and recognise police officers who have given of their lives in the course of their duty. I also acknowledge our serving policemen and women but in particular National Police Remembrance Day, which is celebrated every year on 29 September. Since 1829 there have been over 10,000 people who have served in the Western Australian police service, protecting our way of life on a daily basis. They go out to work each day and their mission is to enhance the quality of life and the well-being of all people in Western Australia by contributing to making our state a safe and secure place. Services will be taking place all around the country to remember our brave men and women in the police services who have lost their lives in the course of their duty. The National Police Remembrance Day service commemorates those Australian police officers who have been killed in the course of their duty or have died as a result of their duties. Equally, I want to acknowledge those who have also been injured whilst performing their duty. We often see photographic evidence of police officers with injuries that leave you mindboggled by the fact that somebody who is protecting society has been injured in such a heinous way, because it is not of their making. Police around the world have a day of recognition observed of the main feast day of Saint Michael the Archangel, patron saint of police. In Western Australia there have been 79 police officers killed in the line of duty since Captain Ellis was speared in the Battle of Pinjarra in 1834. In more recent times, Constable Damien Murphy was killed in a traffic accident in 2007 in Perth while attending to the issue of a domestic violence situation in the suburb of Craigie. Many Western Australians will also still remember the dark day of 26 January 2001, when four officers were killed in a plane crash outside of the remote town of Newman. The majority of West Australian police officers killed in recent times have died as a result of traffic accidents or plane crashes. This reflects the unique challenges faced by WA police services. Western Australia is the world's largest non-federated police jurisdiction. It covers some 2.5 million square kilometres and is bigger than many countries around the world. Deaths in travel reflect the difficult terrain and the vast distances that our police services are required to cover in their daily working lives. I have a strong working relationship with the police in my electorate of Hasluck. This comes from their involvement in the Gosnells and Midlands-the PCYC and officers at the Gosnells, Forrestfield and Midland police stations, who in their efforts combat hooning and anti-social behaviour within my electorate. The police do a tough job and work 24 hours a day to keep the people of Hasluck and Western Australia safe. I think that this is a point often forgotten by some people. When there is a noise in our house at night or a violent situation, who we call is always important and it is always our local police. It is their job to put themselves in harm's way to protect us and, sadly, a number have paid the ultimate price over the years. Their families are affected because it is difficult for any of us to accept a loss in our families, and the gap that is left is challenging. It not only impacts on a partner; it impacts on children, it impacts on the mother and father, the fatherand the mother-in-laws and the other members of the family. They also know that their son or daughter served in the line of duty. The community also suffers at the death of a police officer. This is a person who dedicated their professional life to protecting Western Australians and we are weaker for the loss. I welcome this motion and stand here today to recognise our police in Western Australia and MAIN COMMITTEE",239,Wyatt Roy Mr Deputy Speaker. I Would Always Respect Your Ruling But I Will
321,Mr Wyatt (Hasluck) (12:29,"I want to thank the member for Fowler for this motion. Itpolice officers all around this nation who go and stand where others fear to tread in the name of protecting our society and way of life. I have had the privilege of being associated with the police force through being a mentor to a squad within the Western Australian academy and it is a privilege that I will always cherish and remember. I understand the principle of the police family and the way in which they connect with each other and support each other in times of both need and crisis. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (12:35): I commend the motion moved by the member for Fowler in acknowledging the contributions made by police officers from across our Australian communities. I acknowledge the member for Fowler's former role within the Police Federation of Australia and New Zealand. On National Remembrance Day on 29 September this year we will commemorate the lives of Detective Constable William Arthur George Crews, Sergeant Daniel Stiller and Detective Senior Constable Damian Leedingbrave men who have each made the ultimate sacrifice whilst in the line of duty protecting our Australian communities. The Prime Minister noted this morning that those who serve in uniform do not seek recognition; they do so because they are honoured to serve. It is our duty to recognise those who have served and who continue to serve in the interests of our community, for each day as they go out to work their parents, their partners, their children and their friends can never be certain that they will return to their homes that night. It is for this reason that we honour and pay tribute to those who take these risks on a day-to-day basis to keep our communities safe. It is also for this reason that we honour and pay tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. In late August a 7½-hour police siege occurred within my own electorate of Newcastle in the early morning in Mayfield West. This siege involved a stand-off, with negotiators and heavily armed police from the State Protection Support Unit present. Thankfully, the event was resolved without incident due to the skill and sheer professionalism of those officers on the front line. Unfortunately, as we know, events like these do not always end without incident, as it is impossible to know what can occur. We should for a moment reflect upon and imagine if our loved ones did not return at the end of the day from their workplace. For the majority of us that worry does not affect us, but for the families of those officers who serve across the nation's police forces it is a sure bet that it certainly does. It is well known that my city is one that has had a great deal of problems with binge drinking. Alcohol related violence statistics are the second highest of anywhere in the state, and I know that front-line police deal with this every week, every weekend, day in, day out and that it is wearing them down. I have been at the openings of Law Week in my electorate, where barristers and the law societies have stood and talked about the difficult problem that drugs like ice now cause in law enforcement. It is an uncontrollable time of great irrationality and great violence, and it is our police who are at the front line of that. SoI pay my respects to and congratulate the inaugural National Police Service Medal recipients today for their past and future dedication to the integral role and service they provide. I also note that Hunter local Inspector Bruce McGregor, a Lake Macquarie duty officer, recently took part in a second Wall to Wall Ride of Remembrance from Sydney to Canberra in honour of his fallen mates. Each year, the special service held in Newcastle by the Police Association and by the police themselves is one that is well attended and is one that is an MAIN COMMITTEE opportunity for us to say thank you and to pay our respects. It is important to honour and remember those who have fallen, for it is a consistent reminder of the gravity and sacrifice associated with the role police officers play within our society. It makes us truly thankful, as we should be, for their heroic service to our nation. In dealing with the local police commander in my electorate, he has raised with me the concerns of police officers who suffer stress and trauma in their job. It is time that state governments took on some of those issues. I know that many people would say that policing today is a job in which perhaps one would consider some early retirement opportunities, as we do with the defence forces and other forces. It seems to me that front-line work in the police can have a very long-term cost, and I certainly am one to suggest that that debate needs to happen. I thank the member for Fowler for moving this important private member's motion today and give it my full support. Debate adjourned. Coptic Christians in Egypt Debate resumed on motion by Mr Kelly: That this House: (1) recognises that Coptic Christians in Egypt are suffering ongoing and increasing persecution; (2) condemns the recent attacks on Coptic Christians in Egypt; (3) expresses its sympathy for Coptic Christians who have been victims of recent attacks in Egypt; and (4) calls on the Government to: (a) issue a public statement condemning the ongoing attacks against the Coptic Christian minority in Egypt; (b) make immediate representations to the United Nations to end the persecution of Coptic Christians in Egypt; and (c) strongly urge the Egyptian Government to provide equal rights and protection for all Egyptian citizens regardless of race or religion. motion. In advance I thank all the other speakers who will follow my contribution here today. I also thank my coalition parliamentary colleagues who have supported me in this motion. Egypt is currently experiencing a period of unprecedented transition, the success of which hinges on full respect for the rule of law and compliance with international human rights standards, including freedom of religion. However, while the world has been preoccupied with the so-called 'Arab Spring' little, if any, attention has been paid to the increased persecution of Christians and religious intolerance in the Muslim Middle East. Coptic Christians are the descendants of the original inhabitants of Egypt. They descend from the pharaohs, who built the classic Egyptian civilization along the Nile Valley in cities such as Luxor, and the builders of the Great Pyramid of Giza, which remained the tallest man made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years. The Copts have a long and proud history as Christians, which dates back to the fourth century. In the year 641 AD, when the Arab Muslims invaded Egypt, Christianity was the majority religion in Roman Egypt. Despite the political upheaval following the invasion, Egypt remained a mainly Christian land until the end of 12th century. MAIN COMMITTEE",241,Wyatt Roy Mr Deputy Speaker.

322,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (12:40,"I rise to speak on this important and most timelySince becoming a minority, Christians in Egypt have experienced centuries of discrimination. However, the position of the Copts did improve in the early 19th century. During this liberal period Copts participated in the Egyptian national movement for independence and occupied many influential positions in government and society. Although they represented about 10 to 20 per cent of the population, they were so economically prosperous that they held more than 50 per cent of the nation's wealth. However, following the 1952 coup d'etat, led by Nasser, the conditions of the Copts have slowly deteriorated. A prejudicial legal framework has created a permissive environment that allows Egyptian officials to freely discriminate against Christians with impunity. Christian religious courts were closed and the regime confiscated land and church properties. Permits to construct new churches were delayed. The Nasser government also adopted socialist policies, which further adversely affected the Copts, as they mainly depended on private business for their livelihood. The economic pressures and resurgent discrimination under Nasser led many Copts to start migrating to countries such as the USA, Canada, Australia and Europe. Today there are about four million Copts living outside Egypt, including an estimated 100,000 Coptic Christians in Australia, who have successfully assimilated into our nation and who have made an invaluable contribution to our economic prosperity. However, today, as a religious minority the Copts are subject to ongoing and significant discrimination in modern Egypt and are the target of attacks by militant Islamic extremist groups. The following are just a few examples of the recent attacks on the Christian minority in Egypt. On6 January 2010, in the town of Nag Hammadi, three men sprayed automatic gunfire on Coptic churchgoers leaving a midnight mass. Seven people were killed and several others were injured. On1 January 2011, a bomb detonated in front of a Coptic church, the Two Saints Church, in Alexandria, where a New Year's prayer service was being held. Twenty-three people died as a result of the attack, all of them Coptic Christians, and 97 more people were injured. This was the deadliest act of violence against Egypt's Christian minority in more than a decade, since a massacre in 2000 left 21 Copts dead. On 11 January, 2011 an off-duty police officer opened fire in a train in Minya province, killing one Christian and injuring five others. In early March this year 13 people were killed and nearly 150 wounded in clashes in Cairo that erupted during large-scale demonstrations by Christians protesting the destruction of a church in the provincial town of Sol. The 2011 report by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom makes sobering reading. The commission is an independent bipartisan US federal government commission. Its commissioners are appointed by President Obama and the leadership of both political parties in the House of Representatives and the US Senate. Its report notes: The Egyptian government engaged in and tolerated religious freedom violations before and after President Hosni Mubarak stepped down on February 11, 2011. Serious problems of discrimination, intolerance and other human rights violations against members of religious minorities, as well as disfavoured Muslims, remain widespread in Egypt. Violence targeting Coptic Orthodox Christians remained high during the reporting period. MAIN COMMITTEE This high level of violence and the failure to convict those responsible-including two of the three alleged perpetrators of the 2010 Nag Hammadi attack-continued to foster a climate of impunity, making further violence more likely. The Egyptian government has failed to protect religious minorities, particularly Coptic Christians, from violent attacks, including during the transitional period when minority communities are increasingly vulnerable. Since February 11, military and security forces reportedly have used excessive force and live ammunition targeting of Christian places of worship and Christian demonstrators. … … … In addition, the government has not responded adequately to combat widespread virulent anti-Semitism in the government-controlled media. For the first time the commission has recommended that Egypt be designated as a country of particular concern for its systematic ongoing egregious violations of religious freedom. In addition to violence, Christians face official and societal discrimination in Egypt. Although the Egyptian government officials may claim that there is no law or policy that prevents Christians from holding senior positions, the Coptic community faces de facto discrimination in appointments to high-level government and military posts. Despite representing 10 per cent of the population, there are only a handful of Christians in the upper ranks of the security forces and the armed forces. There is just one Christian governor out of 28 and one elected member of parliament out of the 454 seats. There are no known university presidents or deans and very few legislators or judges. Under Egyptian law Muslim men can marry Christian women but Muslim women are prohibited from marrying Christian men. For all Christian groups government permission is required to build a new church or even to repair an existing one. The approval process for church construction is time-consuming and inflexible. The majority of applications made more than five years ago have yet to receive a response. Egypt continues to have a number of repressive policies and practices that violate freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief. Although the attacks against the Copts were carried out largely with impunity under the indifferent Mubarak regime, the recent announcement that the Muslim Brotherhood movement would now seek the imposition of Islamic law in Egypt is sending shock waves through the Coptic community both in Egypt and worldwide. There is a real danger of the Arab spring falling into a dark Islamic winter. Religious intolerance and extremism are incubators of violence. If radicals grow in influence, they might destroy any new democratic system that takes root, as democracy does not mean that 50 per cent plus one of the electorate has absolute rule over the rest. The true test of any democracy is how it treats its minorities. However, there are some hopeful signs. After a popular uprising that toppled Mubarak in February this year, ending 30 years of autocratic rule, the press in Egypt is now more free and vigorous, and Egypt will start parliamentary elections on 21 November. It still could work out. A real democracy in Egypt with some measure of tolerance of personal liberty may yet still emerge. However, there can be no real freedom for Egypt, there can be no real stability and there can be no economic growth lifting millions of Egyptians out of poverty and into prosperity unless there is full religious freedom in Egypt, not only for the Coptic minority but for all other moderate voices. Now is not the time for silence or appeasement by the international community, for as the MAIN COMMITTEE Copts go so ultimately may go the entire the Middle East. If a Christian minority cannot live within a country which has a Muslin majority population without persecution or institutionalised discrimination, the future looks bleak. Although a number of world leaders, including President Obama and Pope Benedict XVI have expressed serious concern about the dramatic attacks against the Coptic Christian community, the current Australian government has so far been silent. This motion gives this parliament an opportunity to end its silence. Finally, I would like to thank leading members of the Coptic community in Australia, including Father Tadros Simon, Father Antonis Kaldas, and Father Mathew Attia. I commend this motion to the House and I trust it will have the support of all its members. been moved by the member for Hughes and welcome it as an important stepping stone within the process of, in our own way, providing a voice but also, more importantly, seeing potentially improvements in the quality of lives of Egyptian Copts. Like many Australians, I watched earlier this year the historic people's revolution unfold on television, which resulted in the departure of President Mubarak from a position that he had held for 30 years. The revolt was praised at the time by leaders worldwide, hoping that it would usher in a new era of peace and democracy for all Egyptians, I stress that-for all Egyptians. In JulyI spoke in this chamber about the fears of local Coptic Christians in Chifley for friends and relatives at home in Egypt. I was actually approached, while holding a mobile office in Woodcroft, by a number of representatives of the local community who had met with me to discuss their concerns on behalf of family and friends and their fear of genuine persecution for Coptic Christians living in Egypt. The fears that were expressed to me all those months ago continue to exist today, as the transitional government works towards fresh elections and drafting a new constitution. The constitution itself and the parliament remains suspended. Members will remember with horror the outrageous suicide bombing of an Egyptian church in January, as Orthodox Christians celebrated the new year with 21 innocent lives lost in this attack on the Church of the Two Saints. There could be nothing worse than people who are observing their faith having that observation shattered in such a violent way. I certainly condemn it, as many others do and rightly should worldwide. Although Christians are a minority in Egypt, the Coptic Orthodox Church has existed there, where it was founded by St Mark in the first century. Since the 1952 coup in which the Republic of Egypt was formed Copts have faced increasing marginalisation and restrictions. Religious freedom is guaranteed by the now suspended constitution; however there still remain restrictions on building new churches and for people converting to Christianity. I welcome the Egyptian government's statements condemning sectarian violence and their commitment to bringing those responsible to justice, a necessary pre-condition for Egypt to truly be able to say that it is celebrating democratic rights, religious freedom and freedom for all religions. I would hope that the transitional government and the government that follows commit to protecting religious freedom and affording all those in Egypt equal rights as enjoyed by the majority. I am grateful that the member for Hughes has kept this important international situation in the spotlight here, and I am more than happy to support him and lend my efforts, albeit small, in supporting what I think is a very important move. I know the Australian government is MAIN COMMITTEE",243,Wyatt Roy Mr Deputy Speaker. I Would Always Respect Your Ruling But I Will
323,Mr Husic (Chifley,"Government Whip) (12:50): I rise in support of the motion that hasclosely watching to see how minority rights are respected in Egypt's political transition and is deeply concerned by recent escalation in sectarian tension. Certainly, from my own point of view, I have expressed within government, my concerns about the situation and, if there are situations where there is persecution, I have raised being able to provide some sort of humanitarian avenue to assist those people who have that genuine fear of persecution and fear for their lives. Our government has long expressed its concerns for Egypt's Coptic Community, both publically and in diplomatic exchange. I am advised by the foreign minister that Australia's ambassador to Egypt has met with and written to his holiness, Pope Shenouda III, head of the Coptic Orthodox Church, to convey the government's condolences for the 1 January attack and to discuss the situation effecting Christians in Egypt. I understand the member for Griffith, Mr Rudd, raised the situation of the Coptics with members of the Egyptian government when he visited Egypt in February this year and in December last year. I am also told that he met with Bishop Suriel of the Coptic Church in Melbourne in February and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen, met with the bishop in early February as well in a sign of how important this issue remains for the government. Australia's position on religious freedom in Egypt is consistent with our proud legacy of defending human rights at the multilateral level, particularly in the UN. Australia cosponsored the UN general assembly's resolution on the elimination of religious discrimination in 2010, sponsored the mandate of the special rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief at the UN Human Rights Council and is involved in the UN Alliance of Civilisations, which promotes interfaith dialogue, an exceptionally important exercise in ensuring that people of all faiths work together for the common good and that avenues for religious persecution are minimised, with the ultimate aim of ensuring that it does not occur at all. In February last year, the government also submitted a written intervention in Egypt's universal period review at the UNHCR, seeking advice on the status of the Egyptian National Council for Human Rights' proposal for a unified law on the construction and renovation of houses of worship. The government welcomed the interim Egyptian government's announcement in May that it would draft such a unified law and urge the swift adoption of final legislation which will significantly simplify regulations governing the construction and renovation of churches. I hope they take this opportunity to enshrine in legislation all the elements of political freedom which Christians in Egypt have long been denied or have been pressured to not be able to enjoy, and I look forward to seeing progress on this front. Again, for the vibrant Coptic community that exists and for the schools and churches within Chifley, I state in this House my strong commitment and desire to speak up for them on this critical issue. They, like all others, should be able to celebrate and observe their faith free of persecution. Anything that I can do to help them in this cause and to represent this matter elsewhere I will do with every vigour I possibly can muster. motion from the member for Hughes. I second the motion in relation to the Coptic community in Egypt and note my support for the Coptic community in Australia today. There are about 100,000 Copts in Australia. My own experience with that community is that they are making a fantastic contribution to our nation in a peaceful way and are integrating well with our organisations and institutions. MAIN COMMITTEE",246,Wyatt Roy Mr Deputy Speaker. I Would Always Respect Your Ruling But I Will
324,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (12:57,"It is a great privilege to rise to support this timelyFollowing all that has been happening in the Middle East in recent times-the people's revolution in Egypt and the revolutions that have been sweeping through the Middle East-it is important that we stand up for the principle of human rights and defend people's right to practice their own faith and to exist in freedom and peace. I note in particular that Egypt is a signatory to the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which states in article 18: Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance. I think it is important to note those words because all of the evidence we are seeing out of Egypt and that we are hearing from the Coptic community in the international media is that this is not occurring in Egypt today and has not been occurring for some time. The Alexandrian bombing, of course, was one of the most serious and more brutal examples of that, but even a brief summary of the violence and the outrageous acts going on in Egypt today provided by the Coptic community in Australia runs to some four pages, with incident after incident recording horrific tales of injury, bombings, attacks, murders, rapes and other serious crimes affecting the Coptic community in Egypt. It is right that Australia, also a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, stand up and articulate our position that we want to see a constitution and a system of government in Egypt that recognises the human rights of all individuals. That is what is at stake here in this motion today. We are expressing our support for the constitution of Egypt to universally respect human rights in Egypt and ensure that this continuing campaign of violence is ended. It is important to note that, with the removal of Mubarak, there is a historic opportunity to do this. He was a corrupt dictator, and estimates of his personal wealth run up to some $70 billion. For a leader to accumulate $70 billion off the back of his own people when some 40 per cent of them are living on $2 a day is a horrific example of corruption and wrongdoing by Mr Mubarak. His removal during the people's revolution there represents a great opportunity. It also represents an opportunity for extreme groups to seize power. We express our support for the 21 November parliamentary process which we hope will see a tolerant and pluralistic regime in Egypt that will support Coptic Christians as well, realising that they are only 15 million and are a minority within the Egyptian population. They have the right to practise their faith, which is an ancient faith, as they practise it in Australia today. I want to endorse the actions of the Australian Coptic community in holding many peaceful rallies, particularly one in January at Martin Place, where statements of support were read out by various members of this House and by ministers within the government. It is appropriate that we call upon the government to ensure that we are doing all that we can to support the Coptic community in Egypt and to use all our available organisations and resources to ensure that the process in Egypt delivers an outcome that will recognise of the rights of the Copts to practise their faith, free of this intolerance and systematic abuse of their rights. We know from the member for Hughes that many high-ranking jobs and other positions are out of reach for Coptic Egyptians, in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and that there is a systemic problem in the Egyptian constitution in not recognising their right of freedom to worship, in direct contravention with Egypt's international obligations under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. At this juncture, I want to record my great support MAIN COMMITTEE for the Coptic community in Egypt and also in Australia. I recognise their peaceful nature and willingness to practice their faith in peace and freedom with others. which allows us on both sides of the political divide to talk about an issue that causes great concern to members of our community, the Coptic Christian community. I am very blessed, I guess I would have to say, in having a very large and vibrant Coptic community in my constituency. As you drive along the Princes Highway towards the Fountain Gate shopping centre, you can see very clearly from Princes Highway this beautiful church, St Mina and St Marina. It is growing, as the Coptic community is growing, and it is evolving. One of the great things about being the local member of parliament is being able to go to an Easter service or a Christmas service and to share that with friends in the Coptic community, particularly my good friend Father Abanoub, from this particular parish. In doing that I have a window into an ancient faith, practised for thousands of years. For those people to share that with you is a humbling experience that opens a window into the Coptic community's feelings, spirit, soul and history, which are all very rich. Reflecting on that, and speaking to Father Abanoub and to His Grace Bishop Suriel, it pains me deeply to see the distress within the Coptic community about the atrocities being perpetrated on them. As I said, you can drive along Princes Highway and you can see this place of worship, and you can practise your faith there, without oppression, persecution, hate or fear. There is nothing more lovely than walking out after those services and sharing discussions with these great people, watching how successful their community has been. In my parish, I would say, I have close to 2,000 Copts, made up of about 600 families. One of their community, Councillor Sam Aziz of the Casey Council, of whom we are all very proud, has asked me to mention a few things about the community, particularly given his knowledge of the motion that has been put forward by the member for Hughes. He would like to say that over the last 10 years a number of families have come to Melbourne after fleeing persecution in Egypt. He would like to say that amongst these families there are a number of doctors who fled after their businesses were burned down. Since coming to Australia, these doctors have passed Australian accreditation and have opened their medical practices. A number of these refugees have also gone into business, opening retail franchises and construction companies. He wanted me to point out that, after fleeing the persecution that they had experienced, there are so many successful lives that have been led in this community by members of the Coptic community. We all thank them for the contribution that they make to this country, but we share their grief at what is continuing to occur: the fundamental breach of human rights in their continual persecution. Here is one thing that staggered me, particularly when I heard about this unbelievably outrageous suicide attack on the Coptic church which occurred in January 2011-the 22 people that died and the 97 people who were injured. Remember how I was talking about being able to walk out after sharing a spiritual experience with a community. But the perpetrators of this evil atrocity knew that that would cause the maximum impact to that particular community. It was a very powerful message-a message of fear, a message of hate and a message of trying to destroy a community practicing its inalienable human rightand that has to be condemned. It cannot be condoned. MAIN COMMITTEE",247,Wyatt Roy Mr Deputy Speaker. I Would Always Respect Your Ruling But I Will
325,Mr Byrne (Holt) (13:02,"I would like to thank the member for Hughes for this motionThere have been further atrocities that have been committed, and the great thing about the Coptic community, led by His Grace Bishop Suriel-whom I have met, whom we have heard the foreign minister has met and whom my colleague Michael Danby has met as wellMr Ruddock interjectingpowerfully. I am running short of time here, but can I say to you: thank you very much for this. We cannot continue to allow these people to suffer in silence. Their voices must be heard. This persecution must be stopped. You must be allowed to practise your faith without being persecuted, without being killed and without being oppressed. Hughes on moving this motion and doing it so eloquently and thoroughly. AlthoughI did not arrive in the chamber immediately, I heard his early introduction in my office, and he has outlined fully and comprehensively the plight of Coptic Christians in Egypt now. It is very timely that he has done so. It is not the first time these issues have been raised by members. I noticed the member for Aston has spoken in the House on the matter. The member for Hinkler and the member for Menzies have spoken on it, and the member for Holt has spoken previously. I note also that this motion had previously been considered in the Senate. Mr Danby, the member for Melbourne Ports, will be summing up shortly, and he may be able to clarify for me the government's position on this very important matter .I note that this resolution has been strongly supported by the two members who have spoken before-the member for Chifley and the member for Holt-but, on the occasion on which this same resolution was considered in the Senate, Senator Joe Ludwig, responding on behalf of the government, said: We do not support the motion. I will read that again: We do not support the motion. It has been a long standing practice of the government to not deal with complex foreign policy matters by way of simple motion. If that is the government's position, it should be stated in this debate. I would hope it is not, because I would hope that we will give you an opportunity at some time to vote on this matter in the main chamber. The Copts have been present in Egypt since the establishment of Christendom. The role of St Mark, as one of the apostles of Christ taking the message to the people of Egypt, was very much a founding member of the early Christian church, and the Copts have played a very significant part in Christian history. I am one who is strongly of the view that, in the Middle East, Christians still have a proper role. It is where their history is rooted and where early messages were established. I would hope that the tragedy of these events will not lead to people evacuating the Middle East. I think for that reason our encouragement and support is absolutely essential. I have had the great privilege of meeting Pope Shenouda on two occasions. I do know Bishop Suriel, I know Bishop Daniel from Sydney, and I have dealt with the Very Reverend Father Tadros El-Bakhoumi OAM, JP in Sydney, who has been many times Pope Shanouda's personal emissary. I have a small Coptic Church in my own electorate, at Galston-St Mary and St Sidhom Bishay. I was there only yesterday with the congregation.

327,Mr Ruddock (Berowra) (13:07,"CanI congratulate my colleague the member forplayed a part in helping to secure sanctuary in Australia for Copts who find it very difficult to survive, particularly those people who have been the subject of conversions. They are sometimes put under very significant pressure at later points in time. Australia has played a valuable role. I hope that is a role that will continue. For me, the resolution that has been moved builds on the support that we and the Liberal Party have been able to offer to the Australian Coptic community. We have had a number of very significant demonstrations, one as recently as 21 May in Sydney, in Martin Place. I sent a message on that occasion, because it was after the attack on the Coptic Church in Alexandria in which, as has already been referred to, 21 parishioners lost their lives. The escalation of violence against the Copts, including kidnapping, rape and forced conversion is something that has to be condemned by all fair minded Australians. That is why I am gratified that we have this motion that we can vote on and send a very clear message to the Coptic community here in Australia that we support them and we support their fellow Egyptians in the freedom that they seek to exercise, the fundament right of freedom of religion, which we here in this country respect. Berowra and Chifley for raising this issue and for their excellent points of view. As the member for Holt pointed out, it was New Years Eve this year when Egyptian Christians were celebrating at the Saints Church in East Alexandria when 22 men and women were killed and 98 people severely injured in that Jihadist suicide attack on Alexandria's premier Coptic church. The Copts represent 10 per cent of the 80 million people of Egypt, and are the largest Christian community remaining in the Middle East. They are a link to ancient Egypt, because their Coptic language is the last remanent of the language of the hieroglyphs. Their culture and traditions predate Islam. The attack was not isolated and came after months of escalating violence against the Copts in Egypt, some of which continues to this day and to which the member for Berowra referred. Many of the victims of this atrocity have relatives in Australia, where the Coptic community is 80,000 strong. Violence against the Copts in the Middle East has consequences here too. On Coptic Christmas, 7 January, four churches in Sydney were listed amongst 64 worldwide as targets by Al-Qaeda. We have seen attacks on Christian churches on 5 March in the village of Sol after a report of a romantic relationship between a Christian man and a Muslim woman; the killing of nine Coptic Christians protesting in the Mokattam Hills by a mob while the Egyptian military stood by; and the Imbaba Church attacks on 7 May 2011 against the Coptic Christian Church in Saint Mina. The dramatic attacks on Coptic Christians in Egypt had, as I said, that immediate consequence in Australia-the possibility of churches here being attacked. The Jerusalembased reporters of Australia, unfortunately, have not given this sufficient attention in my view. As a leading writer on the Middle East in the Atlantic Monthly noted, this coverage of the siege under which Christianity finds itself in the Middle East was a 'lackadaisical coverage' of the most important story coming out of the area now. Just last October-we have to set this in context-Al Qaeda boasted of its slaughter in a Baghdad church. There Jihadists murdered 58 men, women and children in church, including priests who were praying at the altar. Eighty per cent of Iraqi Christians have had to flee the country because it has been targeted by Al Qaeda and Iraq. MAIN COMMITTEE",250,Wyatt Roy Mr Deputy Speaker. I Would Always Respect Your Ruling But I Will
328,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (13:14,"I congratulate the members for Hughes, Holt,Christians are also under siege in the Palestinian territories. Counterintuitively to the stereotypical world view of the Middle East, only Israel has seen the number of Christians increase, from 34,000 in 1948 to 152,000, according to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics report of 2010. I would hope that Oxfam, World Vision and all of the other aid agencies that are so concerned about this part of the world would speak out on behalf of persecuted Christians in the Middle East, including the Christians in Egypt. We have heard too little from those agencies on that. In contrast, Pope Benedict of the Catholic Church insisted that the Egyptian government had to do more to protect its religious minorities. The former leader of Egypt's maladroit response to his Holiness the Pope was to withdraw the Egyptian ambassador to the Vatican. Pope Benedict argued, 'Words are not enough in confronting religious intolerance, there must be a concrete and constant effort by the world's nations.' In contrast to Mubarak, US President Obama and French President Sarkozy specifically denounced the anti-Coptic violence. I am pleased that the member for Berowra and members of the Liberal Party have been attending to the Coptic community in Sydney. Similarly, in Melbourne I took part in a very serious meeting with all of the Coptic fathers, including Bishop Suriel. This meeting was led on the government side by Minister Martin Ferguson. It was a very useful meeting. We have to continue the non-partisan policy of support for the Coptic community in Australia. I pay particular tribute to my good friend Peter Khalil, the former national security adviser to the member for Griffith, who is a Coptic Christian himself. Peter Day, writing in the Australian Spectator, noted that the violence against Egypt's Christians meant its fate was on the line. Homegrown Jihadists are what we in Australia have the most to fear from in their attacks on the Christian and Coptic churches. I want to congratulate all of the people who spoke in this debate. This is a very serious issue. The fate of Egypt will be partially determined by how Coptic Christians are treated by that country in the future. Debate adjourned. Sitting suspended from 13:18 to 16:01 United States of America: Terrorist Attacks Debate resumed. interrupted last week shortly following your remarks I was about to compliment you on the very fine account you gave of the scale of the attack and the consequences of it in New York. It was one of those extraordinary moments in world history. I have no doubt all people who were alive at the time can remember where they were and what they were doing when they heard the news, just as many of us can remember quite precisely where we were and what we were doing at the moment we learned that John Kennedy had been assassinated. On the occasion of the attack on the World Trade Centre my wife and I had come home. It was late in the evening. We were rung by her brother who told us that he had seen pictures on the television of one of the towers being hit. We were horrified. We were particularly anxious, not least because our own son had just recently travelled to the United States to go to college in Boston, and we were not sure whether he was still in New York or not. He had, in fact, left MAIN COMMITTEE",251,Wyatt Roy Mr Deputy Speaker. I Would Always Respect Your Ruling But I Will
329,Mr Turnbull (Wentworth) (16:01,"Mr Deputy Speaker Slipper, when I wasshortly before, so he was in Boston at the time, but we were not sure of that when her brother rang. So we turned on the television and saw one tower burning and smouldering, then saw the second plane hit. It was an extraordinary moment. Those towers-probably more than any other buildings in the world-symbolised the triumph of American capitalism, the triumph of New York as the great global city. They were symbols of modernity, symbols of modern civilisation, and they were brought down before our eyes and the eyes of millions of other people watching at the time. The tragedy of the attack is indescribable. Who will ever forget the pictures of people leaping out of the building? Why were they leaping? Were they leaping hoping for a miracle, hoping that perhaps they might fall on something that could save their lives or had they given up all hope and felt that anything was better than being burnt alive in that inferno? It is very hard to say. But it was a day of indescribable tragedy and a day also of great courage. Who will ever forget the heroism of the firefighters who battled their way into those buildings to bring people out, so many of them losing their lives in the process? Who will forget the courage of the passengers on United Airlines 93 which, so we believe, was headed for the US Capitol? Those passengers, becoming aware of what was going on through their cell phones, took the self-sacrificing step, clearly, of breaking into the cockpit and overpowering the pilot with the consequence that it fell, crashing into a field in Pennsylvania and killing everybody on board but saving the US Capitol from that attack. We can only imagine what the impact of 9-11 would have been if, in addition to bringing down the Twin Towers and attacking and destroying a wing of the Pentagon-the symbol of American military might-that the home, the symbol, the place of American parliamentary democracy in the United States were turned into a smouldering wreck like the Twin Towers by that plane. It would have been an even more extraordinary day than we witnessed. There were many things to be appalled by and there were many great things to remember. As always on these occasions these tragedies seem to bring out the worse but also the best of the human spirit. On 11 September this year the US Consul-General in Sydney, Mr Niels Marquardt, and the former Australian Consul-General in New York, Ken Allen, and their wives, Judy Marquardt and Jill Allen, organised an interdenominational ecumenical memorial service, which was held in St Mary's Cathedral. There was present, of course, the host, Cardinal George Pell, the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney. There were also present the Imam of the Zetland mosque, Sheik Dr Mohammed Anas, and many other clergyman and religious and community leaders. Among the faith leaders there was the senior rabbi of the Great Synagogue in Sydney, Rabbi Jeremy Lawrence. In the midst of that enormous congregation, and in the midst of some outstanding speeches by the two diplomats and by the other clergyman, Jeremy Lawrence gave a most remarkable speech. I want to read a portion of it into the record today. He asked: How do we respond to the evil destruction of an iconic landmark and symbol, thousands dead, thousands more lives ruined? He said: MAIN COMMITTEE This very question was posed by the rabbis of the Talmud writing of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, the magnificent home of monotheistic belief. -the home of the Abrahamic faiths, the three largest faiths in the world: the original Jewish religion and then the two faiths derived from it, Christianity and Islam. Of the three remarkable faiths, two, Christianity and Islam, are the largest faith communities in the world. He said: When the Rabbis of the Talmud posed the question after the fall of the Temple, one school, the Mourners of Zion decreed that there could be no further happiness. Jerusalem should remain without music and celebration until it was blessed with messianic redemption. In Hebrew, the expression ""Zecher LeChurban"" means remembrance of destruction. Within Jewish practice today every home is supposed to have a ""Zecher LeChurban"" a remembrance of the destruction with a prominent area left unpainted or undecorated. We should have a constant reminder that our lives have lost some of their lustre. At every Jewish wedding we shatter a glass, Zecher LeChurban. However great our joy at the occasion, we remember the Temple with solemnity and sadness. All joy is incomplete and fragmented in the remembrance of what has been lost. Another schoolRabbi Lawrence notesremembered the Temple with a different slant. ""Zecher LeMikdash"" means a remembrance of the sanctuary. Every Passover we eat unleavened bread in a sandwich that the sage Hillel recalled as a Temple practice. On the feast of Tabernacles today we process for seven days with the palm, which used to be done only in the Temple. ""Zecher LeMikdash"" exhort the rabbis. We should celebrate and honour the buildings and the lives lost by incorporating their memories, their virtues and their values into our ongoing lives. How must we respond to tragedy? Do we focus on the churban, the destruction or the mikdash, the sanctuary and its vibrancy. For sure, we do not forget. We do not abandon. Nor do we lose ourselves and augment the ruin. With twin responses we confront the ambivalence of our psyche expressing on the one hand our profound grief that our world is damaged and that we are bereft. But we express on the other, defiance and ongoing struggle; a striving to renew and rebuild. The physical may crumble but the spirit endures. We must not let ourselves be defeated by acts of destruction; nor may we lose hope that we shall see reconstruction and redemption; nor ought we dishonour those who showed faith and resilience in the face of adversity through our own hesitation. We respond by living better lives, through celebrating life and imbuing it with meaning. Rabbi Lawrence there, reaching back to the destruction of another great building, beautifully describes the two emotions, the two approaches that we have to the destruction of the World Trade Centre. We remember the disaster but we also remember the values for which those towers stood-values of freedom-and our commitment to defend those values now and in all the years to come. And a very costly battle it has been. The wars that 9-11 spawned have spanned the world. There is a war that goes on in our own midst: the war against Islamist fundamentalist terrorism. It is a war that is being fought by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. It is a war that has been fought by Australian soldiers in Iraq. Hundreds of thousands have died in the course of these battles, and they are not yet over. Are we winning in Afghanistan? We believe we are winning, but it is a war, as General Petraeus said, that cannot be won in the sense of a complete military victory. Any victory inevitably will be a negotiated one; any outcome will be one negotiated with the Taliban. MAIN COMMITTEE Already, we can see that there are considerable steps being taken by the Americans towards achieving that. In the battle in Afghanistan, the counterinsurgency has been undermined or weakened by the fact that the Afghan government itself, the official government headed by President Karzai, is, in many parts of the country, corrupt and inefficient. So persuading the local people that they should abandon their ties with the Taliban and cleave instead to the new government will be unconvincing if that government itself lacks appeal, legitimacy and authority or is seen as not acting in their interests. The whole objective of counterinsurgency of course is to suppress the insurgents for long enough for the legitimate government to take charge, but if that government we regard as legitimate is not an appealing and attractive one, a government that can obtain and secure the support of the people, then all of the counterinsurgency efforts will be for nought. So, while there are many people who criticise the business of nation building and disregard it, the fact is that without effective nation building the counterinsurgency cannot succeed. We are also faced in that arena with a very dangerous combination of elements in Pakistan. We have there a country which is unstable, which has nuclear weapons, and which has, or has through the operation of certain individuals in Pakistan, in the past shared nuclear weapons secrets with other states, notably North Korea. We have a situation in Pakistan, if you note Anatol Lieven's recent, excellent book Pakistan: A Hard Country, where a majority of the population, in Mr Lieven's view, regard the 9/11 attacks as having been an event staged by the Americans to justify their invasion of Iraq. That seems incredible. If someone stopped you on a bus or a train, as people have occasionally stopped me, and told you that 9/11 was essentially a fraud perpetrated by the Americans to justify an attack on the Islamic world you would regard that almost as the utterings of a madman, but it has very wide currency in Pakistan. We also recognise that the Taliban in Afghanistan are now regarded in Pakistan as a group worthy of support because, firstly, they are seen as the group that will be there after the Americans inevitably leave. Of course, after the Americans leave, the Pakistanis will still be in Pakistan. The Americans and Australians may have gone but the inhabitants of the countries in that region will still be there. Secondly, the Taliban are seen as being a counterweight to the power of India asserting itself in Afghanistan. From a Pakistani point of view, focused always on the rivalry with India, more strength is given to the Pashtun Taliban in Afghanistan as that counterweight. There are no easy solutions in sight, nor is there an easy end in sight to the wars that 9/11 began. Nonetheless, we have no choice but to continue waging them, perhaps in different ways and perhaps more effectively-we should always aim to do that. But the thread that ties all of our efforts-some more successful than others-together is the thread of freedom. It is the thread of those values of economic freedom, political freedom, modernity and liberalism, in the truest sense of the word, that were symbolised by the World Trade Centre, which was attacked by al-Qaeda because of the values it symbolised just as the Capitol would have been attacked, had it not been for the heroism of the passengers of United Airlines 93, because of what it symbolised. We mourn the events of 9/11. We honour those who lost their lives on that day and those who have lost their lives defending freedom ever since. The words of the rabbi were MAIN COMMITTEE profound, reminding us that in the midst of grieving we must also celebrate the values which we have stood for and which were represented by the structures we have lost. In conclusion, I seek leave to table the speech of the senior rabbi. Leave granted. decade has passed since the September 11 attacks on the US, yet for me the images of planes flying into the Twin Towers, the attacks on the Pentagon and the panicked rescue scenes immediately after remain vivid in my mind. The scenes of aircraft flying into the Twin Towers and the towers crumbling were surreal-it was like watching fiction. But they were real and they heralded the dawn of a new era in global affairs. Sadly, it was not a turn for the better, and 10 years later, for all our efforts, insecurity caused by those events still haunts people around the world. The way we go about daily life is no longer the same, and the additional costs associated with the way we now live are probably unquantifiable. Those additional costs have in my view contributed to the global financial crisis. In the light of the ongoing global financial insecurity, some would say that the September 11 attacks, therefore, were successful in bringing down the USA and the Western world. There is little doubt that the counterterrorism efforts and security costs incurred by governments around the world since September 11, 2001 have skyrocketed. In addition, the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have each had their own human and financial tolls. The harsh reality is that, as is the case with all crime, as detection prevention techniques become more sophisticated, so too do the methods of the terrorists. Furthermore, as with all criminal behaviour, new individuals and new cells emerge as others are contained or eliminated. It is a never-ending problem. The changes to airport security alone have been profound, yet I for one hardly feel safer because of them. The killings in Norway in July this year showed just how quickly and how easily it is still possible to bring about the mass killings of innocent lives. The prevention of terrorist acts in all places at all times is simply not possible. The most effective strategy would be to address the underlying motive for such attacks, but even then that would not rule out the actions of fanatics such as those of the recent extremist in Norway. For me September 11, 2001 has a very personal relevance. Andrew Knox, who was killed in the Twin Towers attack and whom I have spoken about in this place on previous occasions, was a Labor Party colleague and a friend. I recall that in my last telephone conversation with him before he left for New York he spoke optimistically of my election to federal parliament as the member for Makin. As it turned out, it was not to be until some years later. For me, however, Andrew Knox's death is a constant reminder of September 11, as is the death of Angela Golotta, whom I have also spoken about in this place and who was subsequently killed in the Bali bombings. Andrew and Angela were both young people with their lives ahead of them. Both were taken without warning as they went about their lives as any of us do each and every day. They had done nothing wrong and had not provoked in any way the attacks on them. It is that senseless killing of innocent lives that makes the attacks even more abhorrent. I recall being called by Tabitha Lean, a mutual friend who had remained in regular contact with Andrew after he relocated to New York, to be told that Andrew had been killed in the Twin Towers attack. I was told that Andrew had been on his mobile phone relaying what was MAIN COMMITTEE",252,Statements On Indulgence
330,Mr Zappia (Makin) (16:18,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. Ahappening when he had to abruptly end the conversation. I can only imagine what it must be like for Andrew's mother, father and brother or for Angela's mother, father and brother. Of course we focus on September 11 or the Bali bombings, but the reality is that all too often innocent lives are lost in terrorist attacks. For many of those losses there is no public recognition, no public memorials, no public sympathy, yet each of those lives was just as precious. Extreme views in society are nothing new. There have always been people who have held extreme views on matters. We are seeing it right now in relation to the climate change debate. The problem arises when those views culminate in acts of violence against those with opposing views or, more often than not, opposing interests. In today's world violent reactions initiated by extreme views can result in catastrophes because of the range of tools and opportunities available to anyone driven to an extreme act of violence. It does not take much to provoke an extremist or deranged person-nor does it take much to provoke a person filled with hate and revenge. It is therefore of concern-and should be of concern-to all responsible people to see the level of provocation and incitement that is creeping into civic life in recent times. Community leaders should remain cognisant of the language and tone they use. They can fuel the fires of hate just as they can calm troubled waters. It troubles me that in recent times I have observed in both public and private discourse a level of hatred between opposing views on a range of matters, including immigration policy, refugee matters, religious and even environmental matters that is neither appropriate nor healthy. Incidents such as the shooting and bombing in Norway and the shooting of US Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in January this year occurred at a time when extremist views were becoming regular utterances of community leaders. Likewise the level of hate mail, malicious statements and sexist attacks on Australia's Prime Minister should be and would be of concern to all decent, fair-minded people. The derogatory way in which the Prime Minister is treated by some says far more about them than it does about the Prime Minister. Regrettably some of the instigators of that behaviour are public people in civic leadership positions. Of course, it is not unusual for political leaders to be the target of politically motivated acts of violence against them. History is littered with such acts. In 1605 Guy Fawkes unsuccessfully tried to blow up everyone in the British House of Commons. In Australia, on 21 June 1966, Labor leader Arthur Calwell was shot and wounded by Peter Kocan as he was leaving a public function at the Mosman Town Hall. Nineteen-year-old Kocan is quoted as saying that he shot Mr Calwell 'because I do not like his politics'. It is my hope, and I believe the hope of most people, to lead a peaceful existence in this world with family and friends. My view is that life is much too short for acts of hatred and extremism. All people wherever they are feel the pain, heartache and emotions that we do. I have seen the tears in the eyes of the Bosnian people, the African people and the Sri Lankans as they talk of the atrocities committed in their homelands. I have followed the strain of the families in Chile, China and New Zealand when miners were trapped underground and the elation of their rescue. It was an experience we were familiar with in Australia. I can only begin to imagine the fear in the eyes of the September 11 victims, and the pain and anguish in the hearts of the families and friends of those who lost their lives. For those who survived and for the families and friends of those killed, their lives were deeply scarred and will never be as MAIN COMMITTEE they could have been. The annual public remembrance of September 11 and other public reminders will not allow them to put the events behind them even if they want to. I therefore hope that 11 September becomes a salutary reminder of the devastation that extreme acts of hatred and violence can bring. I also hope that those who are inclined to perpetrate such acts see the futility of such acts in the long term. There may be some temporary gratification from such acts, but ultimately they will amount to very little other than considerable grief, suffering and loss of life for innocent people who are neither the problem nor the solution to the fanaticism of the perpetrators. On the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks we remember those who were killed or injured, the grief and heartache of the families and friends and colleagues of those killed or injured and the rescue efforts of all those associated with rescue efforts on the day, as well as the ongoing support that they continue to provide to the victims. We also should take a moment to acknowledge the ongoing daily efforts of our police and security organisations in this country and around the world that do an extraordinary job in helping to keep us safe. Perhaps it is only fitting that today in this place we discussed a motion in recognition of the current serving police officers in Australia. In closing, it is appropriate that we remember September 11 for all the reasons that I and all other speakers have referred to. As I said in the course of my speech, I hope we and people around the world can learn from September 11 in a way that ensures that we go into the future in a better world. Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. With crime becoming increasingly global, it is vitally important that Australia has high levels of international cooperation to ensure that criminals are not able to evade justice by simply crossing borders. This necessitates a working extradition regime that includes appropriate safeguards. Australia's extradition relationships with other countries exist to allow Australia to ensure the effective administration of criminal justice here in this country. Our extradition relationships also allow us to cooperate with partner countries to fight crime and to prevent Australia from becoming a safe haven for people who have been accused of serious crimes in other countries. Australia also needs to ensure that criminals cannot evade investigation, prosecution and asset confiscation action simply because the evidence or proceeds of their crime are in different countries. The coalition strongly believes this requires a responsive mutual assistance system to combat domestic and transnational crime, again, with appropriate safeguards built into that system. In relation to mutual assistance, the bill will increase the range of law enforcement tools that Australia is able to offer to other countries-for example, allowing surveillance device warrants to be obtained at the request of a foreign country. I turn now to extradition, which is the process that allows one country to apprehend and send a person to another country to face criminal charges or serve a sentence. As was pointed MAIN COMMITTEE",256,Statements On Indulgence
331,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (16:29,"I rise to speak on the Extradition and Mutual Assistanceout in the Bills Digest, extradition is not actually an obligation under international law. Rather, it is a favour accorded by one country to another. Extradition obligations between countries therefore arise principally from reciprocal treaty arrangements between states. The extradition treaties to which Australia is party are given effect by the Extradition Act. Separate extradition is mutual assistance, which is the process countries use to provide and obtain formal government-to-government assistance in criminal investigations and prosecutions. As was the subject of an earlier bill debated in the House, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Amendment (Registration of Foreign Proceeds Crime Orders) Bill 2011, mutual assistance is also used to recover the proceeds of crime, which is integral to the fight against serious and organised crime. It was also pointed out in the Bills Digest that, although a number of treaties exist between Australia and other countries about mutual assistance in criminal matters, the Mutual Assistance Act does not depend on the existence of a treaty with the relevant overseas country. As our current laws relating to extradition and mutual assistance and criminal matters were passed over 20 years ago, it is important to ensure our measures are responsive and effective. A number of reviews have been conducted since then of the Extradition Act and the Mutual Assistance Act, including a 2001 Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report, a government review in 2006 and, more recently, discussion papers on both acts in 2009 and in January 2011. It is well known that there have been significant changes in the nature and scale of global crime since that time, attributable to globalisation and changes in technology. The Australian Federal Police have expressed concerns that the legislation as it stands has not kept pace with the advancements in technology, including the pervasiveness of technology as it exists today. In a public hearing held by the House Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs the AFP voiced concerns about the fact that it is possible to make phone calls that do not go through Australian exchanges and it is possible to store data on devices and servers that are not in our jurisdiction. The AFP stressed that in order to be successful in the fight against organised crime and in protecting national security this must be addressed. The coalition strongly supports giving the AFP the tools they need to protect Australia's national security. Turning now to the specific measures contained within the bill: notably, it makes amendments in a number of areas. In particular, it amends the following features of our extradition and mutual assistance regimes:  Expansion of the existing grounds for refusing an extradition request to include discrimination on the basis of a person's sex or sexual orientation;  Expansion of the existing grounds for refusing a mutual assistance request to include discrimination on the basis of a person's sexual orientation;  Extension of the availability of bail in extradition proceedings;  Expansion of the circumstances in which a person may be prosecuted in Australia in lieu of extradition;  Inclusion of an express prohibition on providing mutual assistance where it may expose a person to torture, as well as improvements in how the risk of torture is considered in extradition determinations;  Expansion of the death penalty grounds for refusal in mutual assistance requests to cover situations where a suspect has been arrested and detained but not charged; and MAIN COMMITTEE  Expansion of the grounds for refusal to cover mutual assistance requests which relate to all stages of the investigation, prosecution and sentencing of a person. The coalition support in principle the amendments made in these areas. However, we believe it is important to ensure that the extradition and mutual assistance regimes keep pace with changes in technology and global crime syndicates. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs inquired into this bill and tabled their report in the House last week. I wish to thank the honourable member for Pearce, who was the deputy chair of the committee, and the honourable member for Murray, who was the acting deputy chair for the second half of the inquiry. The committee made four recommendations on the bill. Recommendation 1 states that the committee recommends that the bill be passed by the House. Recommendation 3 states that: … the Attorney-General's Department be required to provide in its annual report a record of any substantive breach of an undertaking given by a foreign country in relation to extradition or mutual assistance processes. Recommendation 4 proposes: … that, within three years of its enactment, the Attorney-General's Department conduct a review of the operations of the amendments contained in the Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. The coalition supports recommendations 1, 3, and 4. However, we do not support recommendation 2 as it proposes: … that the Australian Government give consideration to removing the presumption against bail which operates in the Extradition Act 1988 by allowing individuals to be granted bail only in special circumstances. The status quo on the presumption against bail is appropriate as there are significant risks in granting bail to people suspected of serious criminal offences who could potentially attempt to evade justice. Take, for example, the recent case of accused Serbian war criminal Dragan Vasiljkovic, also known as Daniel Snedden, and his disappearance from the High Court in Canberra just one day before it ruled against him in an extradition request from Croatia, resulting in a subsequent 43-day man-hunt. The man-hunt to find Vasiljkovic involved up to 40 police and a four-day covert surveillance operation by the AFP, which eventually led to his arrest. The coalition agrees with the position of the Attorney-General's Department: The current presumption against bail for persons sought for extradition is appropriate given the serious flight risk posed by the person in extradition matters, and Australia's international obligations to secure the return of alleged offenders to face justice in the requesting country. The High Court in United Mexican Statesv Cabal has previously observed that to grant bail where a risk of flight exists would jeopardise Australia's relationship with the country seeking extradition and jeopardise our standing in the international community. Evidence given to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties during their inquiry indicated that the presumption against bail was included in the legislation on the basis that there was a very high risk of a person escaping, particularly since in many cases the person had fled the jurisdiction for Australia to evade justice. Other like-minded countries, such as the United States, also uphold the presumption against bail, only allowing suspected criminals to be granted bail in special circumstances. MAIN COMMITTEE The coalition supports the passage of the Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. We support measures that ensure Australia is not seen as a safe haven for criminals and the profits of their crimes. We also support measures that contribute to improving Australia's international crime cooperation legislation. We believe this bill does that and that is why it will receive the opposition's support. very significant occasion with respect to law enforcement. Today the Prime Minister handed out the first of the 16 National Police Service Medals. It was very good to see the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and a number of ministers there to show their support for people who are on our thin blue line in such a tangible way. By the end of this week we will move to Police Remembrance Day. On the weekend I rode the Wall to Wall Ride for Remembrance from Sydney to Canberra with over 1,200 police officers and their supporters as a fund raising activity for policy charity but also recognising the 749 police officers who have died since the formation of Australian policing. The first person killed in 1803 was Constable Joseph Luker. It is a salient exercise to stop and think that we have lost so many police in the line of duty. One of the things we do is try to do our best for law enforcement officers, equipping our police as best we can, not only with the technologies they need to go about their day-to-day role but also the regular regime they need through the justice system to bring criminals to heel. One of the facts often quoted in this place is that organised crime costs this country about $31 billion per year-an extraordinary reach by criminal activity-and flowing from that the global reach from crime in this country is huge. We might be a very big island and we might be surrounded by sea but with technology as it is now available, the commissioning of criminal enterprise does not have to occur on our shores to necessarily have an impact on us. Things can be commissioned elsewhere and also the movement of criminals has certainly changed the shape of law enforcement. Hence extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters becomes so important. We cannot just look at these things here and now in Australia; we have to make provisions so that we have the right suite of laws to protect our citizens and the right regulatory regime for when we need to extradite people, sometimes from foreign regimes, for the purpose of prosecuting criminal acts. This legislation has not really been adjusted for the last 20-odd years. A very comprehensive review took place, as I understand, in 2006 when discussion papers were released and public consultation occurred. As a consequence, there have been 40-odd submissions made to the public consultation since 2009. The intent of this legislation is to ensure fairness is maintained. It also looks at the global reach in the commissioning and committing of crimes and, in addition, realises the fact that we are part of a world that needs to work together if we are going to ameliorate the effect of crime and criminal activity. We cannot treat ourselves as an island to that extent; we have to become part of the world agenda. The Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 does a range of things. The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 is amended to increase the range of law enforcement tools available to foreign countries with their investigations and prosecutions. The bill will strengthen the protection against providing assistance where either the death penalty or torture concerns exist within the country making the request. It will streamline the existing processes for providing forms of assistance. MAIN COMMITTEE",258,Bills
332,Mr Hayes (Fowler) (16:39,"Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are probably aware, today is aAmendments will also be made to the Extradition Act 1988 to streamline the early stages of extradition and reduce delays, extend the availability of bail at later stages in the extradition process and extend the circumstances in which a person may be prosecuted in Australia as an alternative to extradition if a person is an Australian citizen or should the extradition process be waived for various reasons. The bill therefore has two main objectives: to update and modernise the process of extradition to ensure that Australian authorities can offer a comprehensive range of assistance to our international criminal justice partners; and to increase international cooperation, which is essential to ensure that we address the challenges posed by the effects of globalisation. It is clear that the world is becoming so interconnected, whether it be via technology, communication, travel or whatever. While that is all highly beneficial, particularly to us in an economic sense as well as culturally and socially, it does present challenges to which we need to respond to ensure that perpetrators of crime do not escape justice as a consequence of being able to move from one country to another. Australia's current extradition laws are, quite frankly, dated. They have not kept up with the rapid advancements in technology or the movements across borders. These are things that we need to take heed of as we move these bills through the House. This bill represents a very timely and appropriate answer to those discussions I mentioned in 2006 that called for a fundamental review and reform of Australia's international crime cooperation laws and procedures, including the area of extradition and mutual assistance. The bill will also ensure that Australia does not become a safe haven for criminals. Currently, a person can be prosecuted in Australia in lieu of extradition where extradition has been refused on the basis that the person is an Australian citizen. This bill will extend that arrangement in that it will now be able to be applied to any person to be prosecuted in circumstances where extradition has been refused. Those things are very important; it was not all that long ago that I spent some time with a number of Australian citizens who are currently on death row in Bali. If, for instance, a person committed an offence in Indonesia that attracted the death penalty and they escaped from Indonesia to Australia, we would have difficulty sending that person back. But if we did not do it-if the person was not an Australian citizen and we did not send them back for trial-that would mean that that person could almost evade justice by being over here, making a new life in Australia without any intention of ever going back to face trial in their country of origin. This legislation will allow that person to be tried in our country for the crime that they perpetrated elsewhere. In that way, we would not breach our commitment to not return a person to a country where they might face torture or the death penalty-we would maintain and honour our commitment in that respect-but we would also be doing the right thing in respect of criminal justice. We cannot be a safe haven. We cannot let people slip through the cracks simply by moving across the border. To that extent, this is certainly an overdue piece of legislation. Something that I have often spoken about in this place when we are talking about criminal justice, whether it is the commission of crime or the way we respond to crime, is that technology is an ever-changing space. It is certainly changing at a very rapid rate. We cannot take the view that simply because the way things were done before-in this case, 20 years ago-was for very good reason at that particular point in time means it should be what applies in perpetuity. We owe it MAIN COMMITTEE to all our people on the thin blue line, the 55,000 police we have in this country that go out there day after day and risk their own lives to protect our community from the rigours of criminal enterprise itself and to uphold our justice system. We owe it to them, and to everybody else associated with the criminal justice system, to ensure that we do not have loopholes people can escape through. We also need to recognise that we are part of a wider global community when it comes to the administration of criminal justice. We should not make any apology for being forthright in that respect. We have a role to play. This bill is a timely reminder of our responsibility to ensure that our systems and our suite of laws and regulations are up to date, not simply so they can be reviewed by some other form of judicial committee but so they operate to the extent that is fundamentally required if we are to ensure justice prevails regardless of where crimes are committed. I support the bill and commend it to the House. contribution and particularly note his mention about the Wall to Wall Ride for Remembrance: 1,200 motorcycles and no speeding tickets given out the entire ride, I am sure, Member for Werriwa. It is a fine thing to acknowledge the almost 200 years of sacrifice by the police. The Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 is a piece of legislation I have much familiarity with, having been the Chair of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, which conducted a short inquiry into this bill. I see the research officer, Mei-Lin Wang, who was seconded to the committee, in the chamber here this afternoon. The bill proposes a number of significant reforms to streamline and modernise Australia's laws on extradition and mutual assistance. It is the classic balancing act as represented by Lady Justice, with the scales of justice in her left hand and the sword in her right. I am sure you know that statue, Mr Deputy Speaker Slipper, from your time in the law and on the legal affairs committee. The history of the statue is from the Egyptian goddess Isis and the Hellenic deities Themis and Dike and represents their ideas about divine order, law and custom et cetera. I have read that Justitia is a combination of several goddesses who embodied the right rule for the Greeks and Romans: there is the blindfolded Roman Fortuna, which is fate; the Hellenistic Greek Tyche, which is luck; and the sword carrying Nemesis, which is vengeance. Justitia carries the scales of justice and a double-edged sword in her right hand, symbolising power. The blindfold represents justice being handed out objectively and without fear or favour, regardless of identity, money, power or weakness. Balancing justice is obviously what we as a government are trying to do with this legislation, because it represents a balancing act in acting at the appropriate pace but also making sure that there are appropriate checks and balances so that the minister does not rush through any particular process and so that no foreign country railroads the rights of an individual. It is a classic balancing act in making sure that we look after the appropriate criminal investigations, as mentioned by the member for Werriwa, but also safeguard human rights, especially when we are dealing with international people because obviously they have connections with other nations, have passports and might be inclined to flee. So, in looking at decisions about granting bail, the committee looked closely at the statutory presumption against bail in extradition cases. There needed to be some guiding principles when dealing MAIN COMMITTEE",261,Bills
333,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (16:51,"I commend the member for Werriwa for hiswith federal magistrates and the decisions they make as to whether there is a flight risk, and the committee recommended the government take a very close look at that. We need to consider storage of personal information because-as the member for Werriwa touched onthings have changed a lot in the last 20 years. The computers of 1991 were completely different. The internet was a few years off being broadly available to the world yet now the idea of a world without the internet is preposterous. Consequently, criminals have seen the opportunity. The carpetbaggers of today are sitting on laptops all around the world taking people's information and creaming off money in a way that a burglar in the night taking a couple of silver candles could never dream of. This bill will make important amendments to Australia's laws. It will give the modern law enforcement agencies modern tools so they can work with foreign countries on investigations and prosecutions. We have also strengthened the protections where there are death penalty or torture concerns because as a nation we hold those activities to be abhorrent. Despite the fluctuating talkback radio treatment of such things, we know that as a nation we need protections against such things, so we are streamlining on the one hand yet on the other hand also putting in the safeguards. There may be circumstances in which a person can be prosecuted in Australia as an alternative to extradition. We have extended that provision to any person, not just Australian citizens. Rather than a person getting off scot free, they might be prosecuted in Australia not sent to their country where they could face the death penalty or torture. Another technique I think has been used recently in the US is giving people the opportunity, if they so wish, to waive the extradition process, subject to certain safeguards, so that they make informed decisions with their rights being looked after and perhaps getting the appropriate legal advice-that is, in the interests of sorting out some charges or pending charges, letting that person waive the extradition process altogether. The other thing that this bill does is reduce the time it takes to conduct extradition proceedings. These measures are about reducing duplication of decision-making and cutting through some of the associated red tape, not getting rid of due process or natural justice but making sure that it is a tidier process. The amendments relating to extradition are straightforward. They reduce delays. They allow someone to waive the extradition process. They also allow a person to consent to being surrendered for a wider range of offences as long as there are certain safeguards. We have modified the definition of 'political offence' to clarify that this ground of refusal does not extend to specified crimes such as terrorism. We all know there will always be arguments as to who is a terrorist. The member for Werriwa commented earlier about some of the police deaths. You only need to look at the various treatments of Ned Kelly. Depending on what side of the law or history people are on, they consign him to either being a brutal murderer or some other sort of character in Australian history. The legislation changes allow the Attorney-General to give a legally enforceable undertaking to a country as to the maximum sentence that could be imposed on a person if they are extradited to Australia. They strengthen some of the protections against torture concerns and also require Australia to refuse to extradite a person if he or she may be prejudiced by reason of his or her sex or sexual orientation following surrender. This is not something that is a particular issue in Australia, but it is in countries where someone's sex or MAIN COMMITTEE sexual orientation can cause them to suffer at the hands of the criminal justice system. It is something for us to consider. The amendments relate to mutual assistance. They increase the range of law enforcement tools looking at things like surveillance devices and forensic procedures and make sure there are the appropriate safeguards in place. They also deal with sharing with other countries lawfully obtained telecommunications and make sure that there are protections against death penalty concerns and also the ability to refuse assistance if there are concerns about torture. The bill amends some of the grounds relating to the proceeds of crime actions to make sure that they are more logical. It streamlines the process for authorising the proceeds of crime and allowing registration enforcement of foreign nonconviction based proceeds of crime orders from any country. There is greater sharing between Australia and other appropriately recognised law enforcement agencies around the world. There are also significant changes as transnational crime has changed along with technology, globalisation and the like, and it is important that we respond appropriately. This is a great piece of legislation and I commend the minister for bringing it into the House. Information, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice) (17:01): I would like to thank the honourable member for Moreton for his contribution, the honourable member for Fowler for his contribution and indeed the honourable member for Sterling for his support and contribution to this debate on the Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. The government thanks the House Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, which the member for Moreton chairs, for its detailed and comprehensive advisory report on the bill which was tabled in the House on 12 September 2011. In this report the committee noted the rigorous process of public consultations this bill has been through in reaching this point with the exposure draft of the bill released in both 2009 and in January this year. The committee's inquiry is a welcome final stage of scrutiny in the development of this very important legislation. The committee has made several recommendations which the government accepts are well considered and which we will implement. Firstly, in accordance with recommendation 3 of the report the government agrees in principle to report all breaches of undertakings that come to the attention of the government. Any such breaches will be included in the annual report of the Attorney-General's Department. The appropriate minister or ministers will also be advised of any serious breach of an undertaking to allow the breach to be reported immediately to the parliament. Secondly, in accordance with committee recommendation 4 the government undertakes to initiate a review into the operation of the amendments within three years of the bill's enactment if the amendments are passed by the parliament. The bill currently before the House is the first major reform to extradition and mutual assistance laws in over 20 years. A review of the amendments would provide a valuable opportunity to examine the extent to which the reforms have achieved the intended goal of streamlining the law while maintaining appropriate human rights safeguards. The government also notes the committee's comments in recommendation 2 regarding the current presumption against bail in extradition matters and has given careful consideration to this matter. Unfortunately, reporting and other bail conditions are not always sufficient to prevent individuals who wish to evade extradition by absconding. In extradition cases there is an MAIN COMMITTEE",263,Bills
334,Mr Brendan O'connor (Gorton,"Minister for Privacy and Freedom ofincreased risk of persons absconding before they can be surrendered to the requesting foreign country. This is particularly the case where there are allegations that the person specifically left the requesting country and came to Australia to evade foreign law enforcement. If a person who has been remanded on bail disappears in the middle of the extradition proceedings it can jeopardise Australia's ability to extradite the person in accordance with Australia's international treaty obligations. Ultimately, it could also lead to a state of impunity where a person can disappear and continue to evade law enforcement authorities. I also note that bail can be granted in special circumstances and the government has shown recently a willingness to not oppose bail when these circumstances arise. For these reasons the government considers the current presumption that bail should only be granted in special circumstances as appropriate and it should be maintained. The bill before the House makes important reforms to Australia's extradition and mutual assistance legislation. The bill will modernise these laws to ensure that Australia's international cooperation activities effectively combat crime in a new era of advanced technology, travel and criminal enterprise. The bill will do this by streamlining the process for extradition so that the time it takes to conduct extradition proceedings will reduce which in turn will reduce the time a person spends in custody. Importantly while the bill will seek to reduce the time it takes to conduct extradition proceedings, there is no devolution of the existing protections and safeguards afforded under the regime. The bill will, in fact, build upon existing safeguards by allowing a person to seek bail at several stages in the extradition process and extends the grounds for refusing extradition to include instances where the person may be discriminated against on the basis of his or her sex or sexual orientation. Further, the bill will strengthen measures to ensure criminals do not escape justice by allowing for their prosecution here in Australia where extradition has been refused. In the mutual assistance context, the bill will ensure that Australian authorities can offer a comprehensive range of assistance to our international criminal justice partners subject to the appropriate safeguards. This will include allowing forensic procedures to be carried out and surveillance device warrants to be issued for the purpose of assisting with foreign law enforcement. These new powers will be subject to safeguards which have been modelled on our domestic safeguards to protect privacy and human rights of individuals. The mutual assistance reforms will also extend existing legislative safeguards and protections relating to the death penalty, torture and discrimination. Ultimately the bill will ensure that Australian law enforcement agencies are able to work effectively and efficiently with their international counterparts to combat crime across the world while also ensuring that accused persons are afforded fair treatments.

David Francis Debate resumed on the motion: That the House express its deep regret at the death on 13 September 2011 of the Honourable David Francis Jull, a Member of this House for the Divisions of Bowman and Fadden from 1975 to 2007 and Minister for Administrative Services, and place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. condolence motion. I served with David Jull for all of the time that he was in the parliament, as member for Bowman between 1975 and 1983 and member for Fadden between 1984 and 2007. I saw him last on 28 July this year. It was an occasion when those of us who had served with John Howard in his ministry came together in Brisbane. There were some 20 or more of us present on that occasion. David was not well and that was fairly obvious, but it gave us all an opportunity to share another moment or two with him. He was a person who had served Australia very soundly. I might say it was always obvious that he might do so. I was interested in a piece in About the House magazine in March 1987 because it told us something of David and his personal qualities. He was a journalist. He was the member for Bowman and then the member for Fadden. He spent most of his school life at 'Radcliffe' in Queensland. Then it says: He left the Church of England Grosvenor School to become a radio cadet with Macquarie News Brisbane, where he was mostly involved with news programs and did the state parliamentary roundat the age of 14!

337,Mr Ruddock (Berowra) (17:08,"I very much want to be associated with thishave it corrected. David then moved to Channel 10-or 'Channel 0'; you'd correct that, too, I am sure-where: … he was over ten years a newsreader, journalist and Show Host (he even compered ""New Faces"") … Why do I mention these matters? He had the most resonant voice in the parliament that I have ever heard. Gary Hardgrave's may have come close, but certainly I do not think his had the same quality that David Jull's had. More importantly-and this will be reflected in some other remarks I make-this journal records: His attractions to Liberal Party philosophy dates from when as a boarder, he was given leave to steer a campaign speech delivered by Sir Robert Menzies in the Brisbane City Hall. The contrast between ""Ming"" Liberalism and the ideas of … John Gorton led Jull to join the Liberal Party in 1969. When I went to David's maiden speech, I thought it was important to note some of his observations because they say something of him as a Liberal, and that is something to which I very much related. He said this: We as a government have a very real responsibility for small businesses throughout Australia, because it was the small businessman, the Australian who was prepared to get out and have a go, who was prepared to work hard, who helped build this nation and who made it great. Even today some 42 per cent of the population is employed by small businesses … He was saying this in 1976. He spoke about the importance of encouraging the private entrepreneur and noted that, if you were going to keep unemployment at low levels, it was very important to have productivity. This is what you might regard as being the traditional Liberal approach. But he went on to say: An electorate such as Bowman, because of its nature, has more than its fair share of social problems too. He was a person with a social conscience, and one of those who reflected, I think, the Liberal view that if you are going to be there to build a bigger Australia it is to ensure that you can bring along with you those people who have needs who cannot necessarily well provide for themselves. David got involved very early in his public life here in Canberra in tourism. I thought it was of note that he had the opportunity to serve on one of the early committees of review from 1976, the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism. In later years he had a role in the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation between 1983 and 1984-that short time that he was out of the parliament. And he brought all of that experience not only to serve the electorate that he represented but to highlight the needs of tourism in Australia, in a way which I think few have been able to do in the time they have been involved in public life. I very much relate to David Jull because of the length of his service. There are not many who have had the opportunity to serve as long as he had the opportunity to do. I noted in his last speech he said: This is … the 371st speech I have made since 1981 … I suppose you could add 100 on to that-so we are probably getting very close to the 500th speech … What that really tells you about David Jull is that he was a substantial contributor to the public life of this nation.

I wish too to pay tribute to David, who lost his battle with cancer recently. In reflecting on David's life, we know he was born in Kingaroy, Queensland, and was previously the member for Bowman in this place from 1975 to 1983 and the member for Fadden from 1984 to 2007. We also reflect on his service as Minister for Administrative Services from 1996 to 1997. I was very fortunate and also very pleased and very honoured to work with David on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for a brief period of time before it became that particular committee and for two years afterwards. David was chair of this parliamentary committee and was also chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation from 1997 to 2002, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD from 2002 to 2005 and its successor, in which I shared the bulk of my time with David, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security between 2005 and 2007. It is of note that David served as chair on this committee, particularly in that tumultuous period of time and with the introduction of legislation that was introduced to combat the emergence of the terrorist threat. It was at a time when, as a consequence of 9-11 and events afterwards, the intelligence and security services were expanded massively to cope with the threats of and the war on terrorism. David, in his work on that committee, played a key role in terms of the legislation. WhatI particularly found about David was that he was always impartial. He acted in a very fair and impartial manner. We served with each other on various committees and various manifestations of committees and I certainly saw the equanimity that David had, and his unflappability, particularly in dealing with some pretty difficult subject matter and sets of circumstances and with some pretty complex pieces of legislation. The committee itself we cannot really talk terribly much about, but I certainly saw in David's discharging his service as chair of the committee someone who was eminently suited to the task-and it was a substantial task, particularly with some of the reports that he oversaw as chair. Immediately after 09-11 David chaired two important reports, the first being MAIN COMMITTEE",268,Condolences

As I said, in reading through a number of the reports that David oversaw in his capacity as chair of that committee in its different manifestations, I was particularly struck with the work that he did on the Intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction report in 2003-an absolutely seminal report which dealt with the realignment of our intelligence agencies and a report that certainly, in terms of its recommendations, resulted in the betterment of our national interest and national security. As chairman of the parliamentary committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, David also led an important review into the operations effectiveness and implications of ASIO's questioning and detention powers in 2005. This review supported authorities to have expanded powers so they could detain people on reasonable grounds for questioning, in order to obtain intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorist offence. Another important report that he led as chair of the committee was the Review of security and counter terrorism legislation in 2006. This report proposed a series of modest refinements to improve specificity, clarity and fairness in a way which we believe is consistent with Australia's antiterrorism objectives. In particular, a recommendation arose out of that report as to an independent reviewer of terrorist legislation; that is now the National Security Legislation Monitor. The first report that recommended that was the report that David chaired. I made some inquiries with the staff who had worked with David when he was chair, particularly in my period of time. They were all very deeply saddened to hear of his passing. What they-this was Margaret Swieringa, Jane Hearn, Donna Quintus-Bosz and Cathryn Ollif-wanted to say, particularly to David's family, was how much they had enjoyed working with him and how deeply sad they were to hear of his passing. As I said, this particular committee is not an easy committee to be a member of. It requires a very special person-a person of character, a person of substance. In closing, can I say, in my remarks to this condolence motion, that, on behalf of the Labor members of the current intelligence and previous intelligence and security committees, I wish to pay my respects to David and his family. They should be very, very proud of what he achieved in this role, as we are, because what he has done has resulted in better terrorist legislation working in the national interest. was a staffer back in 1975 until 1980. There were only three ministers from Queensland at that time and of course Queensland as usual was underrepresented on the front bench. We all got to know each other pretty well. The ministers, ministerial staff and all the members travelled together up and down to Canberra from Brisbane and David was one of the characters of the new set-bearing in mind that after 1975 there was only one Labor member from Queensland. The member for Berowra will remember; I think that was Bill Hayden at the time. We formed a very closely knit club of people who travelled together up and down to Brisbane. One thing about David Jull, even in those days, was that he had a wicked sense of humour. He could make something serious sound so funny and that was a way of getting his message over. You would never see anger in David Jull but you would see a lot of humour and a lot of MAIN COMMITTEE",269,Condolences
344,Mr Somlyay (Fairfax) (17:23,"I first met David Jull not when I was an MP but when Iseriousness at the same time. I was reunited with him in 1990 when I was elected to parliament in the seat of Fairfax. At the time. I was Australia's northernmost Liberal, and David mentored and helped me as a new member of the parliament. He was the shadow minister for tourism and aviation; that was his passion. Sir Frank Moore, who was head of the QTTC and of radio station fame, took David under his wing, and he worked for the QTTC during the period he was out of the parliament. When I came in he made me chairman of the tourism and aviation committee, the backbench committee. SoI worked very closely with David for the six opposition years under John Hewson, Alexander Downer and John Howard. In 1996 David was very happy to become a minister. It is the ambition of everyone who comes to parliament, I think, to have the title of 'The Hon.' and to earn it. It is a great thing to be proud of-the fact that you have played for Australia-and David did a great job as Minister for Administrative Services. It was an absolute tragedy, in my opinion, that circumstances led to David leaving the ministry. It doubly impacted on me, because I replaced David in the ministry when he had to leave. While I was very happy to be elevated, I was not happy that it was at the expense of a great man like David Jull. I served with David until 2007. I was on the ASIO committee with him. He was also a very good member of the Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee. David had a passion for Thailand. When I first came to parliament, David Jull used to put out a booklet called A Visitor's Guide to Thailand, so any MP who was visiting Thailand could take Jully's document and find anything in it: how to greet the Thais, what they expect of you, their customs, their laws and a shopping guide. The shopping guide was very valuable. When I walked into a shop he recommended in Thailand with my wife and produced David Jull's card, I was treated like royalty. You have never seen anything like it. The reputation that he had overseas as well as in Australia was second to none. It was an absolute tragedy when David was diagnosed with lung cancer. It was the same year that I had my second round of open heart surgery, so we used to share stories across the corridor about who felt the worse. When David had his operation and had his lung removed, he had a lot of difficulties but he stayed on in parliament. He would catch the 9.35 plane back to Queensland on Friday mornings, and it was very difficult for him, with only one lung, to actually walk up the aerobridge. It was also difficult for me because a year before that I had been sawn in half as well. We had a lot of young members of parliament then who were very anxious to get off the aeroplane as soon as they could when they got back to Brisbane, and I used to try to get poor old Jully's bags down and we would struggle up the aerobridge and laugh about it. He will always be remembered by everyone in this House with respect. You cannot sum up 30 years of service and dedication in a few minutes in the Main Committee or in the main chamber. David's funeral is being held on Friday, and I am sure it is going to be one of the biggest that Brisbane has ever seen. I offer my condolences to his family. I, along with the member for Berowra, was at the lunch which we had in Brisbane because we knew that David was extremely ill and that it would probably be the last time that we saw him.

345,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Werriwa) (17:29,"My first knowledge of David Jull actuallyelection results around the world-you could even find out how many tries Wynnum-Manly scored against Redcliffe in the Queensland rugby league premiership-there was a front-page story in the Australian about this Liberal member of parliament called David Jull, who I had never heard of up that point. He had taken up the rights of underpaid workers in a sawmill in Queensland. Basically a company there had picked up derelict homeless men, paid them extremely substandard wages and here was this Liberal member of federal parliament campaigning for those workers. It really struck me. I do not want to be too stereotypical in my views of the opposition, but to see somebody from that side of politics campaigning for workers rights really struck me. I then had the advantage of spending a period in the state parliament where, it being a smaller building, people live on top of each other and friendships across the house more readily arise. Coming here, he was an extremely friendly person on the other side of politics. I cannot recall him saying a bad word about anyone. He was extremely cooperative and helpful to people. On the foreign affairs committee that I participated in with him, he was always a person who worked to get a consensus and see if we could actually come to agreement about any report that we were undertaking. I know that many members do that, but I think he had a particular propensity for it-seeing whether there was a possibility of getting conflicting views on the one line. People have referred to his interest in tourism. I recall going to Thailand with him on a foreign affairs delegation. I am often assailed for my dress sense, but I recall him taking virtually the whole delegation to a place there and buying suits. He knew were to go in Bangkok to get suits for everyone and arrange it all. I said that despite my image with regard to suits. That was probably one of the better ones I have purchased. Mr Tony Smith: I just said it was probably the last one! delegations. Since the member interrupts, I will recall another foreign affairs delegation. This is something that perhaps the opposition should bear in mind. I was with Bob Halverson, who was later to become the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Bob was there with us. He was making phone calls to Australia every five minutes. He confessed that he had been a close supporter of John Howard but had actually told him that he should get out of politics because his career was over, that he should go back and become a suburban solicitor againironic how things occur in politics in this country. David was a much-admired and respected person in the House. He was person who, more than most, was able to form friendships across both sides of politics. I think he was essentially a liberal, progressive and fair-minded person. I join with other members in recognising his contribution, particularly in the area of contacts with overseas countries, relationships and knowledge of the world. Perhaps it is more common these days, but back then he was probably at the forefront of people who had an interest in Asia. These days you can do everything on the internet, but in those days he had knowledge of where to get the cheapest fares for every trip around the world. He advised members on both sides of politics in relation to that. I join with other members in wishing the best for his family in this very difficult period and in recognising his contribution to the Australian parliament. him for more than 35 years. He was a good principled man who served our country well. MAIN COMMITTEE",271,Condolences

347,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (17:33,"David Jull was a good friend of mine. Indeed, I knew'Jully,' as he was fondly and widely known, will always be remembered for his absolute dedication to his electors. The truly outstanding aspect of his work as a member in his electorate was that he was just as dedicated and just as effective in his final term as he was in first. As has been widely reported, he served in the federal parliament for more than 30 years. When he underwent major lung cancer surgery during his last term between 2004 and 2007, he did not reduce his electorate work, he just restructured it to take account of his reduced capacity to physically get around. Even in his final years here as a member, he would do what he did just about every Saturday morning: drive to one of the shopping centres in his electorate, sit in a prominent place at one of the coffee shops or cafes and talk to his residents. Then he would visit as many shops in the centre as he was physically able to. When members gained access to modern communication mediums with their electorates, such as email and the internet, David embraced them. But he did not diminish his personal face-to-face contact with his electors or the many schools, churches and community groups within his electorate. Anyone who is aware of David's upbringing would not be at all surprised at his personal attention to the needs of his electorate and the community. His father, the Reverend Canon Stephen Jull, was a much-loved clergyman in the Anglican church. David was born in Kingaroy, where his father was a rector. His father spent many years as the rector at Redcliffe, where the parish centre is named after him. His mother, Olwyn, was world president of the Anglican Mothers Union, and a trailblazer for women in the church. David often told the story that he was only able to attend the Anglican Church Grammar School in Brisbane because his father's position as a parish priest enabled him to secure a substantial reduction in fees. Before politics David had a career in radio and television, both on air and in administration; first, in commercial radio and then as the first face seen on the new Channel 0, now Channel 10. What probably sparked his interest in a political career was when at the age of only 19 he became the Queensland state parliamentary roundsman for Macquarie Broadcasting Services when Nicklin was premier. An old friend, Peter Farrell, recalls him as a young publicity manager at Channel 0. Peter was writing the Veritas TV column, and recalls that those were the days of Number 96 and The Box, big publicity budgets, promotional junkets and many long lunches. As Peter says, David was a man of principle, good humour and loyalty. At the end of his time in parliament, David was back on radio-community radio in Logan City, where David shared his favourite music with the wider community. As part of his arrangements with the station he negotiated the right to play his choice of music, which was of course dominated by Dionne Warwick, Motown and classical music-an eclectic mix. In his early days David had a commitment to community service that his parents obviously instilled in him. That commitment encouraged David to seek Liberal Party nomination for the seat of Bowman prior to the 1974 election. He was successful in winning nomination and, after losing in 1974, he won the seat in 1975. It was a seat which he held until the 1983 poll. Less than 18 months later he returned to parliament as the member for Fadden, the seat he held for 23 years until his retirement four years ago. Fadden became a rapidly growing and changing electorate between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. At each redistribution-and they were frequent, given the population growth in SouthMAIN COMMITTEE East Queensland at the time-the boundaries of Fadden changed radically. It began as a seat centred around the south-eastern suburbs of Brisbane, then became a Logan City seat and ended up being a northern Gold Coast seat. Despite all the boundary changes, David assiduously served his electorates and the organisations within his electorate. I am told he moved his electorate office three times as member for Fadden to ensure it was able to service the changes the redistributions caused. He began in Upper Mount Gravatt in suburban Brisbane, then moved to Springwood in Logan and finally to Coomera in the Gold Coast City Council area. As far as David was concerned the electorate came first. His personal convenience or inconvenience was irrelevant. The electorate rewarded him with increasing majorities. Appropriately, his last election delivered the strongest majority in his long career. In the 2004 election, David's primary vote in Fadden was 60 per cent-a swing in his favour of more than six per cent when compared with the 2001 election result. The other hallmark of his long career as an elected member was the loyalty of his electorate office staff, resulting in what must surely be the lowest turnover in an office, especially given the long period he served. Anne Quinlan, or 'Quinno', as David always called her, served as his secretary from 1975 until she retired in 1997. She had previously been his secretary when David was an executive at Channel0 in Brisbane. One area David embraced with enthusiasm at every opportunity was tourism, and despite being on the opposition benches he did enjoy his role as shadow Minister for Tourism and Aviation. While not a great fan of our national airline, which he referred to as the 'flying red rat', he nonetheless had an encyclopedic knowledge of every aircraft flown domestically by Qantas and Ansett, and the history of individual planes. He was always generous with his travel advice and assistance. When friends and colleagues were questioned about their travel plans they regularly responded confidently that they had nothing to worry about as they were flying 'Jull Air'. This usually meant that David had either suggested the itinerary or, in many cases, had made the bookings for them. David Jull was also the highly respected chair of the parliamentary committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation 1997 to 2002 and of its successor, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security formerly the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD since 2002. In this capacity he presided over the committees inquiry into the performance of the Australian intelligence services in relation to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction in 2003-04. David was not just loyal to his electors, not just committed to his parliamentary and committee duties he was also loyal to the party that enabled him to seek to represent them in the first place, the Liberal Party. He was a member of the Liberal Party and more recently the LNP for over 40 years. He believed in the Menzies tradition of the Liberal party. He embraced the reasons why Sir Robert Menzies wanted his party to be known as the Liberal Party, not the conservative party. David was a moderate in its proper meaning. He could not tolerate people who stood on the extreme. As an initial instigator and the unofficial moderator of the Liberal Forum known by its members as Black Hand, Joel used all of his influence and humour to ensure that his Liberal colleagues and friends did not become too full of themselves. He did so with the generosity of spirit and with a firm conviction that Liberals were in fact Liberals. MAIN COMMITTEE Even when David lost his ministry in circumstances many, myself included, regarded as unfair and unjust, he did not complain. His loyalty to the Liberal party remained unquestioned. When the Liberal and National parties merged in Queensland, he remained loyal to the new entity the LNP. Until his final illness prevented him from doing so, David was helping the LNP candidate in this local state seat Ian Walker with his campaign for the forthcoming state election. On a personal note, Jully had a wicked sense of humour and was not constrained by any sense of political correctness. He did not need these constraints because his own values and principles were based on common sense and decency. I can still recall, as those members who served with him would recall, his satirical send-ups and of course his iconic bowling set. Simply put, David Jull was a genuinely good bloke. As he said in his final speech to the House four years ago in December 2007, 'some of my good mates in this place come from both sides of the House'. Tragically, the wishes of the Speaker at the time that it was 'the view of all members that the honourable member deserves a very long and healthy retirement' were not to be. I know the state president of the LNP Bruce McIver and the party organisation across Queensland join me in acknowledging David's outstanding service to the nation, his outstanding service to the parliament and his outstanding service to his electors over 32 years as their member and the LNP and the Liberal Party. got to know Jully, as everybody called him, as a new member of this place. I got appointed to the then Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and the Arts of which David was a member along with that wonderful old character from Corangamite Stewart McArthur and Paul Neville, who was the chair of the committee. The member for Barker might have turned up occasionally too. That was a great eye-opener for a new MP because I had not set foot in this place prior to being elected so I had little understanding of the processes or the way that it will work. You could not get a better apprenticeship from the other side of politics than from those three blokes. We became good friends and still are. Unfortunately we lost David last week. One of the things I remember most about those three blokes, David in particular, was that they never played any party political games on those committees that I served on with him. I can remember David and the others say on a couple of occasions when we were preparing a report, 'The minister is not going to like this.' Nevertheless, they wanted in the report because that was the evidence we had gathered. That was a great influence on me. I have not tried to play party-political games on committees, have I? Opposition members: Never! on my own side too, of course. We had a great time. He was great company, as indeed they all were, and I will never forget him for that. I also remember quite fondly a trip to the Middle East, when the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade were en route to Afghanistan on a goodwill visit to our troops there. I was participating in an Australian Defence Force parliamentary program that involved being in the Navy, serving on the frigates Melbourne and Arunta on blockade duty. We all flew over on the same piece of equipment, a Russian Aleutian 77, which was altogether a hair-raising experience, and then the other group moved onto Afghanistan.

349,Mr Gibbons,"That was David Jull's influence-and, I must say, that of a lot of peoplegood friend of mine, the member for Farrer. I must say I have made a lot of good friends on the other side, more so than on this side, and I think, on that basis, it is probably time. I gave this caper away! On the other delegation were Senator Marise Payne, the member for Maranoa and my good mate Graham Edwards. We all met back in Dubai, when the two attachments finished, and it happened to be Senator Payne's birthday so Jully organised a party at one of the restaurants in Dubai. It was a great night and I remember it fondly. In his inevitable style, he got up and compered our little table-we had a separate room-and gave a running commentary on the participants not only on both sides of the houses but also on that delegation, and it was hilarious. He was great company and one of the greatest storytellers I have ever come across. The last time. I saw David was at a Birregurra branch of the Liberal Party dinner in Geelong two years agoMr Tony Smith: What were you doing there? An honourable member: I ask the same question constantly! explain; it is all legitimate! As I mentioned before, that wonderful old character the former member for Corangamite, Stewart McArthur, was a good mate of mine, and the Birregurra branch of the Liberal Party had organised a testimonial dinner for him. I was invited and more than happy to attend. I was fortunate enough to be seated at David Jull's table. Accompanying David was a bloke named John Crook, who was a Bendigo television identity back in the BCV8 days. He had moved up to Brisbane and had obviously become good friends with Jully. It was really entertaining listening to stories from both men about their early days in broadcasting. Jully told me some wonderful stories about his background in radio. He used to play music-I think it was called being a disc jockey in those days-for one of the big popular music stations in Brisbane, and it was the most popular station. Because of his role there, whenever the big, international rock acts came out to Australia and played in Brisbane, he would inevitably get the job as compere; and, as happened if you got the job of compere at these big rock concerts-I am talking about acts like the Rolling Stones and other really bigname acts-he was always invited to the after-concert parties, and that is where the stories got very, very interesting. I do not propose to go into any of those stories for obvious reasons: a lot of the central characters are still alive, which in itself is a remarkable achievement, given some of the stories that David Jull told us! So it was a great night. I remember that, when I walked in and was ushered to Jully's table, I saw the whole room was decked out in green and yellow balloons, and I said to Jully: 'My God, McArthur's jointed the National Party!' He was quick to point out that, no, he had not joined the National Party; the balloons were the colours of the McArthur tartan, hence it was the colour scheme for the evening. It was David, John Crook and a good friend of mine, the former member for Corio, Gavan O'Connor, who was also a good friend of David Jull's, at that dinner, as well as Stewart McArthur, of course. It was a great night and we all had the opportunity to speak. It was great. I guess that is as good a last meeting as you can get with somebody, being in that environment. I know he was not well, and that was apparent during the night. You all know what it is like when you meet up with people you like, you are friends with and you have not seen them for a while-appointments are made, 'Next time. I'm in Brisbane, we'll catch up for MAIN COMMITTEE",275,Condolences
350,Mr Gibbons,"I see that has raised a few eyebrows across the room, but please let melunch,' and all the names and addresses are taken down. I have been to Brisbane once since then and never had time. Now, of course, it is too late and, boy, do I regret that. He was a wonderful man, a wonderful bloke and a great credit to his party. He never had the tunnel vision or the fanaticism of some of the younger and newer members of the other side of politics. He was always a fair man but he was a fierce supporter of his own political side and its philosophy. I think the Libs will certainly miss him and I think the nation will miss him. I think he was a great servant to his country and a great credit to himself. My deepest sympathies go to his family and his friends. his input to this debate. I think it very well reflects the fact that David Jull made friends wherever he was-not just in parliament. In parliament he made very close friends with some people whom you might have thought would be enemies. I think that was very much David Jull's approach to life. We all know that he was a long-serving member-11 terms in parliament. I certainly do not wish to emulate 11 terms in parliament, but David Jull liked parliament as an institutionand he was an institution in this parliament. He represented the division of Bowman from 1975 to 1983. Unfortunately, he then lost his seat due to the Hawke landslide, but it was not long before he was back in the parliament in 1984. He started off with a marginal seat and ended up with quite a safe seat. That does not happen unless you are doing your job in the electorate and you have the respect of the people in the electorate. He served until 2007 and indeed when he actually left the parliament he was the fourth longest serving member of parliament ever, out of over 1,000 members of parliament. That is a pretty extraordinary record. We know that he had lung cancer in 2005. That was a sad time for all of us-the fact that he had it and that he had to have a lung removed. But, true to the spirit, he said, 'I am going to make sure I get back to parliament.' And so he came back. He obviously was not quite as strong, we all knew that-his big, booming voice was not quite so big and booming any more. Like the member for Bendigo, I last met him at David Hawker's 25th year celebration-that was about two years ago, when we were in opposition. It was great to catch up with him. He had not changed. Obviously, though, he was not quite as fit as he had been. He was a member of the shadow ministry from 1989 to 1994. When we became the government in 1996, he became the Minister for Administrative Services and served in that role from 1996 to 1997. It was often said-and I repeat: often said that Jully, as we fondly knew him, was the unluckiest MP in parliament and deserved to serve as a minister for much longer than he did. When he no longer served as the Minister for Administrative Services, he became chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation from 1997 to 2002 and of its successor, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security-formerly the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD-from 2002. So from 1997 to 2007 he served as chair of one of the most important committees. To be the chair of that committee-or even a member of it-you needed to be someone in whom absolute trust could be placed. The fact that he was appointed to that position shows that people respected his abilities. In this capacity, he presided over the committee's 2003-04 inquiry into the performance of the Australian intelligence services in relation to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. As the MAIN COMMITTEE",276,Condolences
351,Mr Secker (Barker,"Opposition Whip) (17:50): I thank the member for Bendigo formember for Bendigo said, the committee did not pull any punches. The minister may not have liked it, but David Jull was not going to gild the lily. Coming back to him being unlucky, he almost certainly deserved to serve much longer as a minister. I supported him in a vote for the Speaker because I believed he would have served in that role with distinction. I believe he had all the qualities needed for the role of Speaker. He had the experience, there was no doubt about that, and he had the excellence. He had the knowledge of how parliament works-when to use standing orders and, probably more importantly, when not to use standing orders. He had gravitas and he had authority. He had a booming baritone voice. He would not have needed a microphone to rule from the chair. I had the wonderful experience of sitting directly in front of him for nine years. I do not know if anyone else can claim that. I think it was a blessing to sit in front of him for nine years. I heard every humorous comment that he made. I do not think I ever heard him being warned, because he was clever enough to speak at the right time and just loud enough but not too loud to be called to order by the chair. It was really interesting to hear some of his comments and I will reflect on a few of them. I will not say who they are about because some of these people are still in parliament. He had a comment about every member of parliament. His descriptions included, 'ugly as a robber dog's backside'-that brings up an interesting vision-and 'Bob Hawke's love child'. Another one was 'one of the beagle boys'-as an avid reader of Donald Duck comics in my youth, I knew exactly what he was on about. Others were 'member for Nagger Nagger', 'promoted way beyond his abilities' or 'better as a frontrower than a frontbencher'-I think that was something about rugby. He had many, many more, but they were always very apt. He certainly did have a way with words. I might reflect on his wine palate because he had one of the best wine palates in the parliament. One night we went out and somebody bought a bottle of '92 Grange-I would never have been able to afford it-and a bottle of '93 Area Red from Langhorne Creek. Not too many people would have heard of Area Red; it is not one of the great wines. But we all agreed that the '93 Area Red from Langhorne Creek was actually better than the '92 Grange. I happen to know the winemaker because I had played cricket with him. It was part of my electorate and also I spent about 20 of my younger years in that area. I rang the winemaker on the off chance that he had some left. Michael Potts, the winemaker at Bleasdale, had made this wine for Vintage Cellars and Michael said, 'No, I do not have any left, but I will try to find if there is any left in Australia.' True to his word, he rang me the next morning and said: 'There are four dozen left in Australia. Would you like them?' I said yes without even thinking. But I did ask how much per bottle and they were only $28 per bottle-actually a bargain. The first thing I did was to phone Jully and I said, 'Do you want half of these?' Jully said: 'Yes, please. When can you get them to me?' At least I was able to provide some pleasure in his later years with a fantastic wine that we had all enjoyed. David Jull, I drink to your memories and toast a champion. Vale, Jully. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 17:59 to 18:15 spoken on this condolence motion for David Jull.

352,Mr Tony Smith (Casey) (18:15,"I rise to join in the remarks of all members who havesides of the chamber. He was a quintessential character in the parliament. He enriched the Liberal Party and the parliament over what was an incredibly distinguished career. I count myself as fortunate to have gotten to know him not just as a member of parliament from the time of my election in 2001 but prior to that when I was a staff member for the Howard government and even prior to that when we were in opposition between 1990-96. David Jull was so many things. As we know from those who have spoken, he was a good bloke. He was a dedicated parliamentarian. He was a dedicated Liberal. All of the previous speakers have made the point about David Jull's essential decency. His parliamentary career of 11 terms, spanning 32 years less 18 months, tells the story of incredible individual achievement. When people look at his parliamentary career, they see what he did for the parliament as well as the Liberal Party in the years to come. I know that David Jull's memory will go on in this place. As the member for Ryan said just a few minutes before the suspension, David Jull started as a journalist. When you look at his career-and I took the time to dig out his maiden speech from 1976-he achieved a lot at a young age. He was a cadet radio journalist at the age of 19 and became the state political reporter. He describes this very well in his final speech to parliament back in 2007. That career was critical in so many ways because it introduced him at an early age to political reporting and to covering great political events as they were in the state of Queensland. In his final speech to parliament, he tells the story of how he gradually became more and more drawn to the Liberal Party and that the critical element was the election of the Whitlam government and then the experience of that. He became a candidate in 1974. Like so many of that generation, he was swept into parliament in the landslide election of 1975, and he stayed until the tide went out in 1983. He was out for only 18 months. His dedication to the Liberal cause and his commitment to our party and to this parliament is illustrated so much by his determination to come back just 18 months later. It would have been very easy for an ex-journalist to have served seven or eight years and put that down as a wonderful experience and then move on to another phase of their life. The reason he came back was his commitment to the cause. He said in a profile in the mid-1980s that, once politics got into his blood, it was like malaria: it stayed there and re-emerged. Look at David Jull's maiden speech and his final speech. It is touching to look at his ambition for the country and his Liberal philosophy. In 1976, he very much laid down the markers that he thought were important. His concluding comments in that speech on 2 March 1976 were: … one should have a passionate devotion to a cause but I am aware that unless the passion is guided by a sense of responsibility it can be wasteful and indeed harmful to society. He said: I know that I am young and idealisticand he was young; he was only 31but I hope that my stay in this House does not breed that cynicism which has become so prevalent of late. He finished by quoting the words of Winston Churchill condemning socialism. I think, when you look through all those years, three and a bit decades, he did not become cynical, but he had his ups and downs in politics. The Leader of the Opposition, speaking in the House, made the point that David had been a minister-and, we would make the point, for too short a time-and how his passion was to be a tourism minister. The Leader of the Opposition is MAIN COMMITTEE right. He would have dearly loved to have been a tourism minister. But I think the strength of his character is marked out by the fact that, from 1997 until his retirement in 2007, he became a quintessential parliamentarian, an expert in foreign affairs and intelligence, and he played a critical role in the parliament on those issues. We have heard from some on the other side about how Jully-and I can call him that-had friends on both sides, and he did. We heard from the member for Bendigo, who said that they were great mates; in fact, David mentioned the member for Bendigo, and the work they did together, in his final speech. I got to know David better as a colleague after I had entered this place in 2001. As a staff member I had known him, and his friendliness and decency were always there. He had a welcoming smile and a welcoming hand and he was there to be a mentor to anyone on our side who so desired. He was, from all evidence, a very loyal person. One of his closest friends, the member for Sturt, is sitting next to me, and I know that he was a source of great encouragement, strength and advice to the member for Sturt. They lived together here in Canberra. Mr Pyne: For 14 years. young age of 25, and David Jull was pretty young. The member for Sturt is one of a handful of people whom David Jull counted as very close friends. Despite that, he had many mates in the parliament. When we look back on David Jull we will remember a decent man, a man who came here to make a difference and certainly made a difference. many members who have already spoken in this condolence motion. To have given this parliament, and thereby the nation, the service the late David Francis Jull did is a measure of the man, his dedication and the ideals for which he proudly stood. It is said a week is a long time in politics. David Jull experienced more than 30 years of the hurly burly of Canberra and represented the Queensland seats of Bowman and Fadden during that time, 30 plus long years-more than three decades of fine public service. I wish to place on public record the reminisces of the former member for Riverina, Kay Hull, who was deeply saddened when I told her of David Jull's passing. 'He could be raucous and gruff,' she recalled, 'but he was also kind-hearted and an amazing individual. He was an incredibly good politician who was admired and respected by all who knew him on both sides of the political divide. David Jull was a good mentor, a great friend of the tourism industry and someone who will be sadly missed.' May I say the world is poorer for David Jull's death; this parliament is a far better place for the enormous contribution he made. May he rest in peace. Mr Pyne: Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg your indulgence: I know that we are supposed to have this motion until 6.30 but I note that the member for Blair is in the chamber and could potentially begin his debate on his motion. I do not think I will be able to speak on David Jull for two or three minutes and I am wondering whether the government and the chair would give me the indulgence to perhaps start my remarks tomorrow, rather than have them split in two.

One of those individuals in my community is Carmel James. I mentioned her late father Kev Dwyer in previous speeches, a former deputy mayor of Ipswich, a loyal unionist and Labor Party stalwart and a great community advocate. Carmel's life bears the imprint of her father's life. An assistant principal in curriculum at St Edmonds' College in Ipswich, she has had daily impact on the lives of boys who attend the school, but it is as a mother that she makes the most sacrifices and has the greatest impact but receives the least accolades. Carmel is mum to three children: Ben, Lauren and 11-year-old Andrew, who is profoundly disabled with medical and intellectual disabilities. Carmel exemplifies the contrasting natures of motherhood: grace and love, juxtaposed with ferocity and strength. Over the past 11 years, Carmel and her husband Tony have become fierce disability advocates. Just ask the Assistant Treasurer, the Hon.

357,Mr Neumann (Blair) (18:27,"One of the profound privileges of being a member of thiswhen he was the Parliamentary Secretary for Disability Services. Carmel and Tony have used their experiences to tackle inclusivity issues while advocating for a national disability insurance scheme for a number of years. I cannot imagine the depth of concern of having a child with a disability who is reliant upon careSitting suspended from 18:29 to 18:33 (Quorum formed) makes it clear that the current system of disability care and support is unsustainable and unfair. The report outlines that a national disability insurance scheme would address this issue. I am pleased the Prime Minister announced that the government is immediately starting the work of building the foundations for an NDIS. Essentially this will entitle all Australians to appropriate levels of support in the event of significant disability. That support will be there regardless of whether a child is born with a disability or it is acquired. We know that transformational reform of disability services is needed and that work has to start straight away. For 12 long years, the coalition ignored people with disability and their carers-they effectively defunded the system. Disability funding under the coalition grew by 1.8 per cent a year-less than the rate of inflation. The previous coalition government showed little support and little interest in the area of getting people with disability into work. Those with disability who wanted to work had to wait for up to a year to get help through the disability employment services and, when they did, their pensions were reviewed almost immediately. The Welfare to Work program was another coalition failure. The coalition paid lip service to the sector with a succession of failed attempts to support disability pensioners who were keen to contribute more actively in the community. At the last election, the coalition proposed to support just 6,000 children with disabilities and their families. I wonder what the 158,000 students with special needs in Australian schools-and their families-would think. I am confident the coalition do not have a plan to address the 164,000 students in Australia living with disability. I am proud that, in the last budget, we allocated $200 million to support young people with disability in our schools. I have spoken to former and current principals and teachers at Ipswich Special School and Ipswich West Special School-people like Peter Davis, Andrew Thompson and Steven Leese. They warmly welcomed this funding. In my electorate of Blair, those living with disability are well served by a host of providers. Blue Care and UnitingCare provide invaluable nursing services to those living with disability, respite support for those who are carers and employment services to assist people with disabilities gain and maintain employment. Ozcare Ipswich, CODI, ALARA, Community Access and Transition Services Inc., known as CATS, are just a few of the organisations providing support and care for my constituents in Blair. Focal Extended is another great local organisation which rose out of the ashes of de-institutionalisation and the closure of the local Challinor Centre. These wonderful organisations and so many others provide individual support through personal care in-home and community access support. There is after hours school care in Ipswich Special School, vacation care during some of the school holidays, the independent pathways program and the independent living program to support those over 18 years of age. MAIN COMMITTEE",281,Private Members Business
358,Mr Neumann,"The Productivity Commission report into disability care and supportThese organisations do terrific work and we are going to make sure that those with disability are not overlooked or ignored. Their families and their carers need support and care. On 10 OctoberI am expecting a large number of care providers and local agencies to attend a forum where the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon. Jenny Macklin, and I will discuss the NDIS in the Ipswich and West Moreton community. Further to that, on 2 DecemberI will stage the second Blair Disability Links, an expo where disability care and support providers set up information stalls in the Brassall Shopping Centre for members of the community. Last year I held the inaugural event-a very successful event it was-with the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers, the Hon. Senator Jan McLucas attending. These events connect people with the appropriate services so they have a greater chance to realise their potential by increasing engagement with employment, education, training and, indeed, sport. More than that, they provide a networking opportunity for these service providers. It can be a difficult pathway to navigate when you suddenly have a child who has a disability or when your life is turned around through a profound accident that leaves you with a disability. Carmel and Tony James will tell you that one of the most frustrating things for their family is dealing with the mountain of bureaucracy involved in accessing funding and programs. As a schoolteacher, Carmel often sees families who do not cope with these stresses and sees that they get support. But they need more, and it takes determination and energy to ensure you get access to everything you need. Even then in the Ipswich and Somerset region, in spite of the myriad of great services, you cannot get overnight respite easily. I am proud to be part of a federal Labor government that is turning the spotlight onto those with disability and confronting the cold, hard reality that we can no longer ignore the fact that by 2030 an estimated 2.3 million Australians will live with a profound or severe limitation. I am proud that the foundations of an NDIS are being addressed. We no longer want in our country those with disability feeling invisible. Based on the Productivity Commission recommendations, the government has begun the foundations to this major reform, delivering an immediate additional $10 million to support the technical policy work, establishing a COAG select council for ministers from Commonwealth, states and territories to lead the reform, establishing an advisory group to the select council led by Dr Jeff Harmer to provide expert advice in delivering the foundations for reform. This vital work will be crucial for the care providers and its agencies in Ipswich and the Somerset region. We are also providing additional funding of $147 million for the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative. This will be a great help for early intervention. There is the $60 million Supported Accommodation Innovation Fund. That is all in addition to the $7.6 billion provided to the state and territory governments through the National Disability Agreement to deliver increased and improved specialist disability services such as support accommodation, target support and respite. The Productivity Commission recommended that the reform process will take seven years to be done right and to be financially sustainable. I know the James family has been fighting for 11 years to see significant reform. They appreciate that unravelling the various Commonwealth, state and territory systems and programs will be a mighty challenge. But, MAIN COMMITTEE like them, we want to see reform sooner rather than later. As their federal member, I still have to look them in the eye and explain why the process is long, but we are determined to deliver an NDIS. Only then will people like Carmel and Tony James have the confidence that Andrew and others like him will receive the care and support that he and others will need throughout their lives. As their local federal number and part of a government that makes the tough decisions in the nation's interest I am pleased to support a national disability insurance scheme. I will continue to advocate for families like the James's, for kids like Andrew and for the many carers and support agencies in Blair that have committed themselves to supporting those with disabilities. Carers Queensland say that there are more carers in my electorate than in any other electorate in all of Queensland. This is not just a peripheral issue. This is a mainstream issue that affects average families and individuals throughout the length and breadth of this country. Communities like mine, the Ipswich and Somerset regions, will benefit greatly from an NDIS. I commend the motion to the House. facing people with disabilities and their carers. I would also like to thank and commend the member for Blair for presenting this motion. I do not thank him for some of the party-political ranting which started his address, but he eventually got past that and started to talk more constructively about the issues facing people with disabilities. I believe there is a need for bipartisanship as we deal with the very real challenges facing people with disabilities and their carers. I also refer to the Productivity Commission's final report into disability care and support, which found that the current system of disability care and support is unsustainable, underfunded and unfair and that it does not deliver the appropriate levels of care and support to Australians with a disability. I am certain that is not news to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and it is not news to me or to anyone else who has spent any time at all meeting with people, getting to understand their issues and trying to deal with the many inconsistencies that exist in the current system. The current system of support for people with disabilities and their carers is broken. It will be expensive to fix it but we are, I hasten to add, a very wealthy nation. The question should not be: can we afford to do better? The question should be: can we afford to let the current situation continue? We need to deal with the big issues in the disability sector. There are big issues such as the differing levels of assistance provided, depending upon how you acquire a disability; young people with disabilities who are forced to live in aged care homes because of a lack of residential care available for them; the lack of respite care for carers, who are doing the toughest job in the world but who need a helping hand; providing more funding for basic facilities like wheelchairs and modified vehicles, which often require volunteer fundraising activities in each of our electorates; and providing caseworkers to guide parents as they navigate their way through the maze of support services when they first are told that their child has a disability such as autism. In my very first speech in this place I spoke about the need for increased funding in regional areas for support services for children with a disability, and I will continue to support efforts from both sides of this chamber for a better system. The opportunity presents itself today for me to publicly acknowledge the work of the former Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers, the member for Maribyrnong, and also the shadow minister, Mitch MAIN COMMITTEE",282,Private Members Business

It is a hope that someone in a position of authority is on their side, and I congratulate him for his capacity to champion in this place the needs of people with disabilities. In that same vein, I would like to congratulate the Premier of Victoria, Ted Baillieu, for being at the forefront of this debate at the state level, for being prepared to advocate for a national disability insurance scheme and for offering Victoria as the ideal location for a trial of a national rollout of such a scheme. I would also like to congratulate the people who work in special schools and other facilities who are directly involved in providing support services for people with disabilities in my electorate. They do an amazing job with great love and tenderness for the people in their care. It can be a very difficult job at times and it is an unforgiving role in many ways, and I know the families certainly appreciate the support they receive from you. People with disabilities and the people who care for them often feel that they are alone in our community. They often feel that they are outcasts and that they are the problem that noone else wants to deal with. I would have preferred tonight to have this debate about the national disability insurance scheme in the main chamber. I would have preferred that we debate this all week. Rather than talking about the carbon tax, which I believe is a multibillion dollar cost on the budget for something that may or may not happen in several decades time, in the disability sector right now we are talking about something that is very real on a minuteby-minute basis, an hour-by-hour basis and a day-by-day basis for people in my community. It is happening today. People need help today and it will require a multibillion dollar commitment from this and future governments. The case for the national disability insurance scheme is compelling, and I have spoken about it publicly on many occasions in my electorate. I acknowledge the member for Blair. In his comments tonight he made it sound as though, just by announcing it, the NDIS is already in place. I am sure he did not mean it to sound like that, but people in the disability sector are very concerned. The Labor Party made the in-principle announcement that it is on side and certainly the coalition has made an inprinciple announcement that it supports that position. IfI have any criticism, it is that I am worried about the time frames. It seems to be a very slow pace for reform and I believe we have to move as fast as we possibly can to achieve a fair and workable system. I take on the member for Blair's comments that we do need to achieve this sooner rather than later. It is a big reform, but we need to keep in the back of our minds that people need help today. We need a system that puts people with disability at the very centre of the equation and provides them and their carers with flexible packages to access the services which most meet their needs in their own particular communities. I think we can do a lot more to help keep families together, as they are the ideal units to care for a person with a disability. I fear that too much of our current debate in the disability sector is crisis driven. The families at the centre of this issue are often left to soldier on. If they are not directly in crisis at the time, they are often left to fend for themselves, but there is no question that they do need more help. It always seems to me that it is very difficult for governments to loosen the reins of control and let local communities develop some local solutions that suit the needs of local people, MAIN COMMITTEE particularly in regional areas, but we are going to need that flexibility in the new scheme. We must not use planning for the National Disability Insurance Scheme as an excuse to stop the other reforms that are required from occurring in the meantime, as there are many steps that we can take now. On a cautionary note, I am wary of state governments backing out of their current levels of commitment under the guise of preparing for the NDIS. Time is going to prevent me from talking at any great length about some of the other issues, but I would like to pass on some of the direct comments from local residents that I met with just last Friday in my electorate. I was there with the state member for Gippsland East, Tim Bull, who has been another great champion of people with disabilities in my community. I met with a parents and staff members associated with the MyTime program. For members who are not aware of MyTime, it is a very good program. It provides respite for mums, dads and grandparents, or anyone who is caring for a child with a disability. It gives them a couple of hours on a weekly or fortnightly basis to get together. Their child with a disability is looked after by a professional carer while they have got the opportunity to meet and discuss issues of concern to them. Its ongoing funding is uncertain in the sense that groups are forced to fundraise to make sure they can afford to pay for the extra help. I think the funding is committed to about 2013. I call on both sides of the House to remain committed to this program and to ensure it continues into the future. One person who attended the meeting was Shirley, who is one of the coordinators in Sale. She said to me: I just look at these wonderful parents and think to myself what is being done for them. Everything they do is for their children. The My Time program is one little thing we can do to help them. It gives them a chance to get together and network and learn from each other's experiences. Christina, who drove 50 minutes to attend the Sale MyTime gathering, put it this way: I can talk to my family and friends but they don't get it like the parents in this room. It is not just to have a chat it's to share information too – it's a great support to me. I would also like to refer to a letter I have received from Jane and Shannon Nash, who describe themselves as 'parents and advocates for a child with a disability.' It is disappointing that they have to describe themselves as advocates, but in many cases parents have to go into bat to make sure they get access to services for their child. A couple of points that Jane and Shannon raised in this letter are that case management should just be a given when a family has a child who is diagnosed with a disability. They write: 'Our experience was tough. We found we had to self-advocate because professionals we were in contact with did not have the time or the knowledge and expertise to access the system for our child. Our experience has been that the system is inadequately funded and under-resourced. This results in families such as our own being ignored and turned away because they are not considered to be in desperate need.' The letter I have got here from Jane and ShannonI will pass on to the minister. The really strong point they make towards the end of their letter relates to the family in a situation where you have a child with a disability. There is not a lot of support for the siblings, who often make many sacrifices because parents quite naturally have to put more time and effort into the child with a disability. They make this point: 'We are a family of a five. Our son's siblings are troopers and they love him very much. There is no support for siblings who have a brother or a sister with a disability.' They go on to say, 'Parents like us are trailblazing MAIN COMMITTEE for those that come after us in the hope that conditions are made better for these wonderful but vulnerable children.' Decisions made in this place are not academic and when it comes to the disability sector they have a real impact on real people. In the little bit of time. I have left I will take as an example the government's decision to withdraw funding for the Take a Break occasional childcare program, which has caused enormous concern in my electorate where in many towns the occasional child care provided by that program was the only child care available to these people. Kristin met with me last week and told me about the support the Take a Break program had provided to her and her son Tyson, who has autism. I will also be passing this letter on to the minister, but I would like to quote from it: Tyson was recently diagnosed with high-function autism, which has been a huge challenge for me over the years. Michelle Brooks has helped me for two years now with Tyson and the change in him has been amazing. Tyson wouldn't be making friends if it wasn't for the centre and its fantastic workers. Tyson is also coming along in leaps and bounds with his speech because of the interaction with all the other children. Michelle goes out of her way for my son and to lose that now when he is doing so well would break both our hearts. The Take a Break program is one the government should not have ever thought about defunding and I call on the minister to change her mind. I am confident that, more broadly speaking, we are on the right path with the bipartisan plan to introduce a national disability insurance scheme. As always, the devil will be in the detail but we do have this opportunity and we must get it right for the sake of people with disabilities and their carers throughout our nation. Ms HALL (Shortland-Government Whip) (18:50): I congratulate the member for Blair for bringing this motion to the parliament and the member for Gippsland for his contribution to the debate. Before entering parliament I worked with people with disabilities and I believe that the National Disability Insurance Scheme is a big step in the right direction, something that is very long overdue. I have great pleasure in supporting this motion before the House today. The Productivity Commission Report into disability carers support was groundbreaking and I have to congratulate the member for Maribyrnong for the role that he played when he was parliamentary secretary. He was totally committed to ensuring that people with disability actually got a better deal than they have had in the past. The report highlights the importance of funding, it highlights the importance of access to services and it really details the issues that are important for people with disabilities and their carers. I do not think there would be a member in this parliament who has not had the parents of a child with a disability come to see them and express their fears and worries about what is going to happen to that child as they become older: that there are not the proper supports in place and that there is not the availability of care and accommodation that their child will need. This Productivity Commission report that the government has given an undertaking to support and introduce is going to address those issues. I have two young girls with disabilities who come into my office and work and I know that their parents are concerned about them having the opportunities that they need in life. One concern is about making sure that one of the young women can find suitable living accommodation, and the other young woman is keen to enter the workforce. MAIN COMMITTEE I must congratulate the Prime Minister on already giving an undertaking of $10 million. The issues that I have found over the years that are terribly important to people with disabilities and their families are access to funding; care and support for carers; obtaining the aids, appliances and equipment that people with disability need; housing; living independently; and work. Work is an issue that has been very difficult for a number of people with disability, and I see that this will create opportunities for people with disabilities to enter the workforce, to be able to compete for jobs and to have the support in place that they need to be able to obtain employment. The National Disabilities Support Scheme will provide assistance for a person throughout their life. Instead of trying to grab a little bit of money from here and a little bit of money from there, trying to get assistance from some employment brokerage or agency, it will all come as a package. The needs of that person will be paramount in where they are going. As somebody who has worked in this area and fought for people with a disability to get the piece of equipment that they need and to find a suitable place for them to live in, I know that when the disability insurance scheme is fully operational it will not only make a difference to their lives but actually change them. No longer will there be fundraising for a chair for a person who may be a quadriplegic or a paraplegic. That will no longer be necessary. Rather, they will have the right to expect to live a full life just like other Australians. The scheme will take seven years to be fully implemented, but it is important that we do it properly. It is important that we have in place the right sorts of frameworks, and the Disability Insurance Scheme put forward by the Productivity Commission in its report will ensure that the lives of people with disabilities are changed forever. motion. I enter this debate in a unique position as someone in this parliament who, alongside fellow carers across the country, watches with interest the announcements about changes to the disability sector, knowing full well that the current patchwork state and federal system of disability support is inadequate. The Productivity Commission's report into disability care and support has reinforced what people who live with disabilities and their carers have long known, which is that the current system is broken and needs a full overhaul. For a parent caring for a physically or intellectually disabled child, it is a lifetime's task and, with such poor assistance available, they have little choice but to abandon any hope or thought of a career in order to take up life as the family carer, which is often lonely, arduous and poorly compensated. For carers there are no sick days, there is no holiday pay and there is no superannuation. A parent caring for a physically or intellectually disabled child lives with the fear and stress of what will happen to their child when they are too old or too frail to care for them anymore. This is a story that I have heard and felt countless times from devoted carers, and it is also a fear that I myself have personally felt. The time and emotional energy involved in caring can significantly influence the dynamics within a family, and so it is little surprise that when parents have a disabled child the chance of marriage breakdown almost doubles. We are a wealthy and compassionate nation. The time has come when, as a society, we must find ways to provide a generous and practical response to properly assist those with severe disabilities and their carers. While the blame game is not as evident in disability support as it is in other aspects of our health system, the responsibility for disability support is MAIN COMMITTEE",284,Private Members Business
360,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (18:55,"I am pleased to rise to speak on this importantfractured across federal and state jurisdictions and that has lent itself towards needing closer examination for some time. Currently, the federal government has responsibility for specialised employment assistance and income support, while state and territory governments are primarily responsible for accommodation support, community support and access to respite services. In its draft report on disability care and support, the Productivity Commission reinforced the coalition's long-held position that disability support is a core government responsibility and must be treated as such. In response to the release of the report's recommendations, Carers Australia President Tim Moore described feelings of 'great hope' and that 'Australia would at last introduce a scheme that would provide quality care and support to all people with a significant disability'. Indeed, that is the hope of all Australians. But, as always, the devil will be in the detail. It is important that the legislation surrounding this reform is focused on three core deficits in the current system. They are: community and workforce participation and assistance; increased support for those with disability and their carers; and a simpler support system and advocacy support to help people navigate the bureaucratic maze. A national disability insurance scheme must be the goal of this parliament to work towards, but we must get there sooner rather than later. Talk of it being introduced nationally in seven years should be unacceptable to everyone. The Second World War was fought and won in less time. In quantifying the unmet need for care and support for Australians with disabilities, the Productivity Commission has established the figure that it will take to provide the sort of care and support that rightfully should be expected of Australians who suffer with severe disabilities and their carers. The Productivity Commission prices the scheme at $6.5 billion, which is no small cost, but it is one that should be, and indeed must be, achievable under a responsible government. It is a national disgrace that the equivalent of the full cost of financing this important scheme will now have to be paid out in the annual interest payments on the debt this Labor government has racked up in just four years. To be able to afford the cost of providing the resources that those with disabilities and their carers need and deserve we must have the economy firing on all cylinders. We must end the waste, we must end the mismanagement and we must end the indulgent schemes. Support for disabilities is not welfare. It should not be. It is an entitlement to assistance and participation in our community. for its initiative, endorsing the vision set out in the Productivity Commissioner's Disability care and support report. The main recommendations of the Productivity Commission are:  A National Disability Insurance Scheme should be created to provide all Australians with insurance for the costs of support if they or a family member acquire a disability. The scheme will provide individually tailored care and support to around 410 000 people with significant disabilities.  A National Injury Insurance Scheme should be created to provide no fault insurance for anyone who suffers a catastrophic injury. The report also identified a seven-year time frame to transform disability services. As a result of the report, the Prime Minister is in the process of establishing a select council on disability reform at the next meeting of the Council of Australian Governments. This would bring together Commonwealth and state treasurers and disability ministers to do the work needed to lay the foundations for change. MAIN COMMITTEE",288,Private Members Business
361,Mr Melham (Banks) (19:00,"With the member for Blair, I commend the governmentIn response to the Productivity Commission's recommendations for the states and territories to harmonise their approach to catastrophic injury, the government will also convene a working group, led by the Assistant Treasurer, to work with state and territory governments, lawyers and other stakeholders to progress this important complementary reform. In my role as the member for Banks, I meet regularly with people who have disabilities and their carers. Some of the key points of the Productivity Commission report are similar to those which have been raised with me by those individuals. The inconsistency within the current systems is the outstanding issue, together with the difficulties for individuals in establishing what community and government support mechanisms are available to assist. There is obviously significant work to be done in setting up the disability insurance scheme, so it will not happen overnight. As with any national project of such significance, it is best that it is done correctly from the outset. In the short term, the government has moved to deliver an immediate additional $10 million consistent with the Productivity Commission recommendations to support the technical work, move to establish a COAG select council of ministers from the Commonwealth, states and territories to lead reform in this area at COAG and take steps to establish an advisory group to the select council led by Dr Jeff Harmer to provide expert advice on delivering the foundations for reform and preparation for launch. On its website, the Productivity Commission highlights the following-and I think it is worth stating:  Most families and individuals cannot adequately prepare for the risk and financial impact of significant disability. The costs of lifetime care can be so substantial that the risks and costs need to be pooled.  The current disability support system is underfunded, unfair, fragmented, and inefficient, and gives people with a disability little choice and no certainty of access to appropriate supports. The stresses on the system are growing, with rising costs for all governments. That is on the Productivity Commission website. This is an area that deserves cross-party support. It is an area that does not deserve political point scoring. For too long, all sides of politics have looked the other way. We have an opportunity to build on the Productivity Commission report and to do good. I happen to be one who believes that it is imperative on government to provide a safety net for the vulnerable, the disadvantaged and the disabled in our community. I do not apologise for that. It is the role of the more fortunate to help the less fortunate and we should not apologise for it. NormallyI am one who is critical of the Productivity Commission, because their philosophy has been very different to mine over the years. But in this instance I have no problem in fully embracing each of the recommendations of the Productivity Commission report. For the Productivity Commission to be giving politicians a wake-up call in this area is something I find quite interesting. I commend the motion of the member for Blair to the House. I think it is good that we have an opportunity to put our point of view in this place. more fortunate helping the less fortunate. I commend his remarks. As the population ages, as medical intervention at birth increases and as health know-how improves, the number of people with a disability will increase.

362,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (19:05,"The member for Banks put it very, very well: thesupport-will decrease. It is therefore time to take stock and plan adequately for the future. We need a vision for equity, for fairness and for justice for those with a disability and for the fantastic people who look after them. On6 April this year at the Wagga Wagga RSL Club organisers of an information session held about the National Disability Insurance Scheme put out 200 chairs. Another 200 were required; more than 400 people turned up to tell those politicians present-and I was one of them-and others how much this is needed. All Australians feel the need to have control of their own lives and it is incumbent upon the Commonwealth government to provide this freedom. By highlighting my utmost support for this program I was told I was the first parliamentarian in New South Wales to sign up to the wonderful Every Australian Counts campaign. I would do it all over again, as I feel this is an extremely valuable scheme for our society. A national disability insurance scheme represents a fundamental reform to the way services are funded and delivered. In a budget of $350 billion, surely we can find it in our hearts as well as our finances to find the necessary dollars. As the member for Hughes said, it is an extra $6.5 billion. But I see this is an investment, not a cost. The member for Hughes also stated what a compassionate nation we were-and we areas well as acknowledging the fact that the current system is broken. The Productivity Commission certainly thinks we can find the money. We just need the political will, hopefully the bipartisan will. The economic case for reform for the National Disability Insurance Scheme has been described in terms of the number of people with a disability increasing significantly in the next 20 years, while at the same time the number of people willing and able to provide unpaid care will fall. Government is responsible for funding the difference between the two. The resulting increase in costs has the potential to overwhelm already overburdened state treasuries. If current growth continues, the amount spent on specialist disability services alone will double in 14 years. A National Disability Insurance Scheme will ensure governments have the ability to meet current and future needs, whatever the economic climate. It will also provide other important economic benefits. As I said, I see it as an investment. By focusing on early intervention and identifying those support services which are most effective and efficient, the scheme will maximise the potential of and facilitate greater independence for those who most need it. By providing people with what they need when they need it the scheme will ensure people with disabilities, their families and their carers have every opportunity to reach their full potential. Surely this is such an Australian ideal. This is about providing people with a disability with what they need when they need it and it should also reduce the pressure currently experienced by families of those unable to fully participate in work, life and the community. It will also enable much-needed respite. The scheme could be funded by all taxpayers through general revenue or through a Medicare-type levy. Financing will have to be arranged. The modelling also needs to be worked out. As I said, the Productivity Commissioner said that we can do it, so surely we need to follow that lead. If the commission says we can do it then we have to find the necessary political will to be able to do it. This needs bipartisan support. Funding for essential care, support services, therapy, aids and equipment could then be drawn from this consistent MAIN COMMITTEE pool of funds. The principal beneficiaries would be people whose disability has a significant impact on their daily life. Most importantly, the scheme would provide support no matter how that disability was acquired, because it can happen to anyone at any time. People born with a disability or who acquire a disability through accident or injury or as result of a medical condition or mental illness would all be eligible for assistance. Recipients with a lifelong disability should not, as they are now, be required to constantly prove their disability to continue to receive assistance. Eligibility for the scheme would be transparent, based on careful assessment. The system could be person centred and individualised, based on the choices of the person with a disability and their family. It would focus on early intervention and provide the supports that provide the best long-term outcomes. Importantly, as I said, we must not forget that disability can happen to anyone at any time. Let us not wait for what might happen; let us act now and put in place a system for those who may need to rely on a little more assistance than many of us do. We need to plan properly for this and make sure it is done correctly but put it in place as soon as is humanly and legislatively possible-not in seven years time. As the member for Hughes said, that is far too long. Debate adjourned. Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service Export Service Rebate Debate resumed on the motion by Mr Cobb: That this House: (1) requires the responsible Minister to: (a) immediately commission an independent study on the legitimate costs to the Government of Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS) Export Service Inspection Fees and Charges for the six affected industries (Meat, Fish, Dairy, Horticulture, Grain, and Live Export) as evidenced at the AQIS – Australian Meat Industry Council joint ministerial taskforce meeting No. 15 on 7 May 2010; and (b) table in the House: (i) a document that explains how the Government will provide a reduction in annual regulatory costs to the export industries in the order of $30 million per year from 1 July 2011; and (ii) a document that outlines the completion of reforms that were to be delivered as part of the agreement to remove the AQIS Export Service rebate between the Government and the six affected industries; (2) notes that the above commitments were part of a package agreed to by the former Minster for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in return for the passage of the Government's legislation to remove the 40 per cent AQIS Export Service rebate; and (3) calls on the Government to continue the AQIS Export Service rebate until the reforms are delivered, as agreed to by the Government. exports, whether it be primary industries, minerals or food and fibre, I rise today to speak in support of this very important motion, which is around the AQIS export service inspection costs, the rebate, which has just been knocked off by the government, and the efficiencies that were promised as part of the deal struck back in 2008-09. This motion is important, as the industries have without doubt been left in the lurch following the government's axing of the 40 per cent AQIS export service inspection rebate. The Labor government has failed to MAIN COMMITTEE",290,Private Members Business
363,Mr John Cobb (Calare) (19:11,"As a citizen of a country that is very dependent ondeliver on its side of the bargain. On1 July this year, the inspection service rebate ceased, yet promised reforms and efficiencies have not been in place, putting significant strain on the six most affected industries: horticulture, meat, dairy, fish, grain and live exports, as well as many small niche industries involved with them. This government has once again failed to deliver on its promise and, as a result, I have introduced this motion into the parliament, calling on the government to keep the AQIS export service rebate in place until the government upholds its end of the bargain. There was an understanding by all industries that the promised reforms would be put in place by the time the rebate period cut out, which was 30 June-1 July this year. This clearly has not happened, and the government should be, and is being, held accountable. The reforms in 2009 came after the Senate disallowed moves by the Rudd Labor government to axe the AQIS export certificate rebate, which was worth approximately $40 million annually and higher, depending on the amount of produce exported. As a result of our standing shoulder to shoulder with the industries and not allowing the government to simply walk over the top of them, as they normally do with agriculture, the former minister for agriculture, Tony Burke, announced he would offer the industry a $127.4 million export certification reform package to fund efficiencies, reforms and the AQIS costs until July of this year. Now, we agreed to this and, in a letter of agreement written to me and signed by Minister Burke, he stated: Successful implementation of these reforms will provide a reduction in annual regulatory costs to the export industries in the order of $30 million per year from 1 July 2011. It will also provide the opportunity for removal of substantial costs from the export supply chain for industry and AQIS. That was in the letter we got. But now, as we have come to expect of the Rudd-Gillard government, the government has not fulfilled its side of the agreement. None of the reforms and efficiencies were actually delivered by the time the rebate cut out. There was also a commitment by Minister Burke for an independent study of the legitimate costs of government as agreed by the minister. This has not even commenced. The minister has claimed that this is an audit of AQIS's cost-and I acknowledge the member for Lyne, who is polite enough to indicate he wants to table that. I have no problem with that. But that is a separate commitment. The government has not delivered on its commitment for a legitimate cost-of-government survey. Let us remember that our main competitors, Brazil and America, require almost no contribution from industry. They pay 85 to 90 per cent of similar costs in their countries. The minister is wrong. As a legitimate cost-of-government survey it was a commitment to examine if any of the costs related to AQIS export service inspection fees and charges were related to costs that serve the broader Australian public, to establish the level of that broader public benefit, beyond those directly involved in the industry, and whether a clean reputation for exports or the ability to resolve problems arising quickly has a broader benefit to the Australian community, as indeed the high level of Australian agricultural and fishery commodities do. The government has acknowledged that there are certain activities that are not costs that industry should have to pay for, but instead of maintaining the vital activities it is just discontinuing the services in its desperate search for cash. Market maintenance and improvement activities, technical operations and assistance and overseas inspector capabilities to deploy when issues arrive all have a broader benefit to MAIN COMMITTEE Australia and our export reputation. Our competition provides these services and does not expect industry to have to bear the costs. The government has made a promise, yet no reforms have been delivered, no efficiencies have been gained and no legitimate cost-of-government studies have been delivered. Despite not delivering on its promise, the government has collected on its side of the deal and removed the 40 per cent rebate as of 1 July. Let us look at the horticulture industry, for example. That industry reform process alone has cost a staggering $1.6 million over the past two years in an attempt to increase efficiency within the industry, but there has been no progress. The horticulture industry is one of the success stories in Australia in recent times, and the fruit and vegetable part is one of those where it is line ball as to whether they are importers or exporters. The horticulture industry taken as a whole is a huge growing industry and is contributing a lot to exports. Yet if we send the wrong signals to the industry that the government will stand beside it we limit its desire and its need to expand. The government has tried to simply move the responsibility of inspections from government to industry, yet for such a diverse and seasonal industry with many small operators it is unlikely to work. Operators are not large enough to absorb the cost of inspection staff and it is going to be very difficult to find and train staff for such seasonal work. The government cannot even clarify whether the export industries involved will be comfortable with AQIS's proposed approach. This is not reform; it is just cost shifting. As of 1 July 2011 all industries involved are facing increased costs. With the removal of the rebate the industries will have no choice but to pass these costs on to producers. Because of the coalition making it plain that we would once again stand with our export industries, we have introduced this motion to show that even though the meat industry has done a deal with governmentagreed to sign off on that and we are not going to use the opportunity given to us to stand aside. However, there are five other industries which still need the government to work with them to sort it out. This is especially important as the government is also about to hit these meat processors with the world's biggest carbon tax. I could talk about that for a long time, but I will not. Do not underrate the effect that has on the meat industry and the processing industry, whether it be horticulture, meat or whatever. One of Australia's better abattoirs looks to be going to get costs-because they will trigger the carbon tax, and there will be their power bills-of $3 million a year extra. At a time when we are crying out for export industries to help us, that is not a great way to help them. The government has been forced to act on the meat export industry and I now call on the minister to provide a similar package for each of the other export industries and to carry out the legitimate costs of government study it promised under the original agreement. It is ridiculous that the government has had over two years to implement efficiency measures, but two years on they are no closer to any reforms. They have had to concede that with the meat industry they are three years behind because the current deal does assist in some measure those in the meat industry to get the efficiencies that were originally promised of $30 million a year. In three years time they will far exceed that. I ask the current minister to fulfil the deal put forward by Tony Burke, who was then the minister, in 2008-09 because Australia's export industries, agriculture and fisheries, need them.

365,Mr John Cobb,"Only because you had to. Because the industry asked us to we have the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, especially under Liberal governments. I once studied meat inspection so I know a bit about lymph nodes and other things. But I did not go on because other things intervened, especially politics. I believe there is a need for change, and change is certainly coming around. There were inherent inefficiencies in the system that the previous government had not addressed in 2001. I will come to those later. However, since this government has been in there has been considerable change. Maybe the honourable member opposite has not been keeping up with those changes. There has been an investment of $127.5 million over three years in the development of a modern export certificate scheme that maintains Australia's reputation as a producer of high quality safe food products; $85 million was in export certificate rebates and the remainder was a project and AQIS staff redundancies, which had to occur. We have also finalised a review of the fee structures and the overhead allocations that have set new fees and charges, which we will be able to see on the department's website, and which will cover all the industries that the member for Calare has sought. I would like to table the independent review of AQIS fees and charges in the meat program. This was tabled on 8 May 2010. I seek leave to table it. Leave granted. available on the department's website. I see that in 2001 the then government took 40 per cent off the export fees and put it on to the budget. That was real efficiency! It is probably why the constituents of Lyons lost out on some of their health budget coming through to Tasmaniabecause some of it was taken off by that sort of process. It was not about making industry more efficient et cetera-I concede that the member for Calare was not the minister at the time. There has been extensive consultation with the Australian Meat Industry Council, in particular, the budget for the meat program in 2011-12 and that will be $56 million. For last financial year the budget was about $78 million, and the previous budget for that was closer to $85 million. So this will allow not only costs to be reduced but also more meat to be processed in Australia. It brings down the cost of processing. The budgets for respective programs are all subject to a process of consultation and ultimately become part of the public record. The government has been working hard to ensure our major trading partners, including United States, understand that proposed reforms to the meat inspection system will provide at least equivalent outcomes and greater transparency than the scheme under which we operate now. The US has the most complex regulatory requirements, as I remember from my days in the meat industry, followed by the EU and some northern Asian markets. Meat exports exceed $5 billion per year, so it is a considerable industry for our country. Therefore, we should get these reforms right. I am told the US formally accepted the proposed export meat inspection service model in March this year and we are moving towards a full roll-out of the AEMIS across all red meat processing establishments to reduce government program costs from around $80 million per year to approximately $56 million per year. So the government and industry have been working hard to find efficiencies in each of the export certified programs. The member for Calare might note that it has been a collective effort. We could reduce costs MAIN COMMITTEE",294,Private Members Business

367,Mr Adams,"The government has approved a cost recovery impact statement and it iseven further but the government and the meat industry are not interested in efficiencies if they compromise market access. On5 September the minister announced that the government would implement the Australian export meat inspection scheme from 1 October and provide $25.8 million in transitional assistance. I understand that the opposition has begrudgingly-I heard the members say this-come to the party, announcing it would support the regulations underpinning the reform. I am pleased that they have done that. The minister has told me that he has arranged a briefing for Mr Cobb on the status of the meat program and advised Mr Cobb and Senator Colbeck that the government is continuing to work on a sector by sector basis on reform. Government is continuing its reform process but there is no one-size-fits-all approach to these matters. The minister says he will continue to liaise with the export sectors to discuss their proposals. So this motion from the member for Calare is rather behind the times in as much as what he is asking for has already been covered and he has not recognised the amount of work already undertaken in this area. Perhaps he has not been briefed by his own side. Maybe he needs to talk more with his own people. I think the opposition is trying to give the impression that something is wrong when the government and the industry are getting on with the business of supporting regional jobs and reducing red tape, making our industry more efficient and more effective, as we need to do. I think that new technology is being drawn down to help reduce these costs. Of course, that will add to productivity and improve our export prices and our overall position. Australian processing and our manufacturing sectors do have to be price sensitive, especially with the price of Australia's dollar. We need to keep this industry up on its training, to engage people to enter the trade, enter the work and work in the meat industry. I am sure you, Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore, who have quite a works in your electorate, would always be thinking about where labour is required to get into our regional works. There are lots of regional jobs in Australia. My local works, which is pretty much a large one from Tasmania's perspective, employs hundreds of people and this works, where I worked many years ago, has been employing people for 50 to 60 years. It is tremendous to see that that is still occurring. We need to continue making our industries more effective and more efficient, but it is not about government carrying costs for industry. Industry has to carry its own costs. We need high-performance meat inspection and a certification model which is at the forefront of international expectations to carry us into the future. This industry is worth many billions of dollars to us. We have to make sure that it is efficient and effective and we need to always make sure that we do that. We have started that across several of the sectors which are important to us, but it is no good trying to say that you can do this half-heartedly. You have to go in, negotiate right across the industries and achieve an efficient outcome. The international market access across all commodities through this will help us regain more market access, I believe, over the next 18 months. I oppose the motion. member for Lyons for his contribution but I would point out to him that the government only came to the party and delivered the $25.8 million to the industry after this motion had been moved in the House. I think it would be fair to say that the only reason that they did this was because this motion was moved and they were probably deeply concerned that this motion would be passed.

368,Mr Tehan (Wannon) (19:31,"I rise tonight because I seconded this motion. I thank the Government members interjectingcoalition has once again played a very constructive and positive role in producing an outcome, in this instance for the meat industry. I would like to especially recognise the member for Calare for the role that he has played in bringing about this positive outcome. It is a positive outcome, but there is still more to be done. I do not think that those opposite should rest on their laurels and think that because they have delivered this money that that is the end of it. There are still very deep concerns, especially amongst the smaller players in the industry, about the implication that this move to full cost recovery will have. As a matter of fact, last week I had a representation from industry in my electorate asking me to once again take up this issue, and that is something that I will be doing. I have asked the constituent to provide me with the relevant information and I have said that I will approach the minister. I intend to do that and I hope the minister will be prepared to listen. For the benefit of the House, I just want to outline what the member for Calare and I, in seconding this motion, set out to achieve. We wanted an immediate commission of an independent study on the legitimate cost to government of AQIS export service inspection fees and charges for the six affected industries as evidenced at the AQIS-AMIC joint ministerial task force meeting on 7 May 2010 and we would still like to see that. Obviously we have the horticultural industry, the fish industry, the dairy industry, the live export industry and the grain industry still waiting to see what the government will do. We have also called on the government to table in the House a document that explains how the government will provide a reduction in annual regulatory costs to the export industries in the order of $30 million per year from 1 July 2011. We would still like very much to see that document and also a document that outlines the completion of reforms that were to be delivered as part of the agreement to remove the AQIS export service rebate between the government and the six affected industries-the meat industry, the fish industry, the dairy industry, the horticulture industry, the grain industry and the live export industry. We would still very much like to see this. We also noted that the above commitments were part of a package agreed by the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in return for the passage of their legislation to remove the 40 per cent AQIS export service rebate. We called on the government to continue the AQIS export service rebate until the reforms are delivered as agreed by the government. As we saw, the minister has, to the tune of $25.8 million, come to the table, sat down and negotiated with the Australian meat industry to get a resolution. It is not by any means a perfect resolution, but it is better than where we were and I am happy to say that. I commend the industry for having sat down with the government and for being able to put a strong case to get that $25.8 million. That is a good outcome of the motion that we have put in the House and a good outcome that it has pressured the government to sit down with the industry and deliver this $25.8 million. I know that those opposite are not very good at giving credit where credit is due, but if some of them do I am sure the member for Calare would gratefully receive that feedback. If you were going to be fair about it, that is what you would do. I hope the government are going to sit down with the other five affected industries and come to a similar resolution with them, because this is too important an issue to those five other industries for the government to sit back, rest on their laurels and say, 'We have done MAIN COMMITTEE",296,Private Members Business
369,Mr Tehan,"Those on the other side may laugh, but I would like to highlight that thethis for AMIC, so that is where it is going to stop.' I hope we will see the government continuing to sit down, listen and deliver much-needed resources to those other industries as well. I would say once again that I also think the government needs to consult with the smaller businesses, especially in the meat industry. We have to recall that ultimately what we are doing is passing on to business 100 per cent of the legitimate costs for inspection services. There is no other country in the world that does this. We are passing 100 per cent of the legitimate costs for inspection services onto business. This is a big step. We have to make sure that our meat industry remains as competitive as possible. If we do not, they operate in an international environment and our meat producers will suffer as a result. Let us not forget that the government is also putting additional costs on the meat industry. The meat industry is a trade-exposed emissions-intensive industry. What they are about to be hit with in the carbon tax legislation is going to make them less competitive and is going to put their costs up. We are going to be doing this at a time when we are also hitting them with this extra cost to their business with regard to inspection services. SoI plead with the government: reconsider the way you are going to treat meat processors under your carbon tax legislation. You are going to put a huge additional cost on the meat processors and they are trade exposed and emissions intensive. So think about that. You might have come to the table late with your $25.8 million for the inspection services-and there are still concerns around the smaller processors-but, when it comes to your carbon tax legislation, you could be doing insurmountable damage to the international competitiveness of meat processors. So think long and hard about that and think whether you have that right. It has given me great pleasure to second this motion, because one of the most efficient and best meat processors you will come across globally is in my electorate of Wannon. I refer to Midfield Meat. They are a huge employer, they do an outstanding job, they are mechanised to a standard that you cannot find anywhere else in the world and they are also a terrific community based company which puts a significant amount back into our local community. I also have smaller meat processors right across my electorate who do outstanding jobs as well. This is an important motion; it got the government to act-just before time. Let us hope the government now will act on its carbon tax legislation as well. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (19:41): I was going to start off somewhere else but, having listened to the honourable member for Wannon, I have to give a few targeted rebuttals to some of the absolute nonsense I have heard here tonight on this motion. The honourable member said to give credit where credit is due, so I will start by noting, with respect to the move to full cost recovery, two things which relate to what the honourable member for Wannon said. Firstly, he said that it does not happen anywhere else. Yes, it does-that is not what the meat processors and others say and they are people that I talk to regularly. Secondly, I note that it was under the Howard government that this system started. SoI am happy to give credit where credit is due-not like you, coming in here when you end up in opposition and pretending that you had nothing to do with it and did not know about it. You come in here and all of a sudden just do a complete turnaround-180 degrees. Mr Tehan: On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker: I do not think the member is being relevant to the submission. MAIN COMMITTEE",297,Private Members Business
370,The Deputy Speaker (Ms K Livermore,"There is no point of order.Ms SAFFIN: I am being very relevant-I am talking about the absolute political and popular opportunism of the National Party in bringing this motion before the House. You talk about relevance, but this motion has no relevance to what is going on. I will turn to what is going on. The conversation on this issue, as members would know, is a conversation that takes time because we are working across a number of highly significant industries. The meat industry is the one that I know most about but I have information about all of them. That conversation continues. It is, in fact, more than a conversation; it is a consultation, conversation and deep engagement with the industries and with the government. BeforeI go into that, I will go back to 'credit where credit is due' and I want to pay credit to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig, for the work he has done and for the agreement he reached recently with AMIC. I have seen the letters and I have been involved in it. the chairman of the Australian processor council and of the Australian Meat Industry Council, Mr Gary Burridge, is also the CEO of the Northern Co-operative Meat Company, which is in my electorate. So it is an issue that I am engaged in at a local level but with which I also have some familiarity at the national level. The agreement is something that AMIC is really pleased about-they put out media releases on it. It is what they have been working towards and it is what I have been supporting them working towards. It is no good writing a three-part motion, coming in here, getting up and just mouthing off-mouthing words and not doing any of the hard yards and the work to support the industry. A key area where they need support is particularly around access. Yes, we can talk about money and, yes, we can talk about certification, but we have to maintain that market access and we have to have regulatory schemes in place that do not impede or damage that market access. That is where the government, through the minister, is doing a lot of work with the industry. That is what it is about: cooperation. It is not about the nonsense that we have heard here tonight. I have a couple of points I would like to make. Firstly, in the honourable member for Calare's motion he talks about immediately commissioning an independent study on the legitimate cost to the government of Australian quarantine and of AQIS. It goes on about the six industries. If you read it, it is designed to engender some urgency, as though there is some panic around it. There is not. There is a lot of work that has been happening and it is just part and parcel of that modus operandi. My understanding is that there is a review of the fee structures and the overhead allocations. All the honourable member has to do is go onto the DAFF website, for a start, and it is there to read. I am really pleased with the agreement that was reached with AMEC and the terms of reference also for the AMEC-government joint ministerial task force with the export meat program and export certification reform. The work that has been happening and the work that still has to happen is really clear with those joint terms of reference. The government has invested a lot of money in this. The government has invested $127.5 million over three years in export certification reforms. That is money well spent and money that I want to see spent in that area. I understand that $85 million of that was in export certification. The government also approved the cost recovery impact statement. The budget for the meat program, as I have outlined, was subject to extensive consultation and we know what the budget allocations are from 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12. MAIN COMMITTEE The industry and the government are always working to find efficiencies, and that helps productivity as well as savings. That is part and parcel of what industries do and what governments do all the time. It has been a great collective effort. We talk about credit where credit is due, and I know that in my local media I claimed some credit: I crowed too, because I represented the local industry. I worked collaboratively with the minister and with the local meat industry to ensure that there was that support in moving to that full cost recovery with the export certification scheme. The industry has been really sensible in moving to this. With the motion that we have before us it would be more useful if the time were spent even talking about how we can collaborate to some of the members who are seized and concerned with these issues. There is nothing against that in this place. It does not matter what party members come from, they can do that. We do that from time to time, and when we do that we do it well. And yet, time after time. I am in this chamber and find myself speaking on motions like that which the honourable member for Calare has put up that are both out of time, out of date and irrelevant to what is actually happening at government level and in the industry. My seat is a rural seat. I have agricultural industries, and I care about them and work with them. What galls me is seeing the National Party members just playing around all the time with this. When they are in government they are with the Liberal Party as part of a coalition and they support free trade and those things. Yet they come in here and say something else and go out into the electorate as though they do not. I have seen it with bananas and I have seen it with apples. They just go out and say what they want to and what they think somebody in the electorate wants to hear. That is not conscionable, it is not fair and it is not real to do that to farmers and to the industry. We have an obligation to be absolutely upfront with them about what is happening. We are a trading nation. In the meat industry alone a lot of the chilled and packaged meat is exported. I want to give support where I can, and that is why I work to make sure that we, like the transition with the cost recovery and the certificate scheme, give support where the industry can work to find its efficiencies, where it can work to ensure that it stays competitive and where it can ensure that it continues to have market access but also develop further market access. That is what it is about: staying competitive and staying relevant. It is not about these nonsense motions that we have before the House. Ms MARINO (Forrest-Opposition Whip) (19:51): I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Calare. I note that the motion states: That this House: (1) requires the responsible Minister to: (a) immediately commission an independent study on the legitimate costs to the Government of Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS) export service inspection fees and charges for the six affected industries (meat, fish, dairy, horticulture, grain, and live export) as evidenced at the AQISAustralian Meat Industry Council joint ministerial taskforce meeting No. 15 on 7 May 2010; and (b) table in the House: (i) a document that explains how the Government will provide a reduction in annual regulatory costs to the export industries in the order of $30 million per year from 1 July 2011; and (ii) a document that outlines the completion of reforms that were to be delivered as part of the agreement to remove the AQIS export service rebate between the Government and the six affected industries; MAIN COMMITTEE The motion continues: (2) notes that the above commitments were part of a package agreed to by the former Minster for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in return for the passage of the Government's legislation to remove the 40 per cent AQIS export service rebate; and (3) calls on the Government to continue the AQIS export service rebate until the reforms are delivered, as agreed to by the Government. The motion touches on the fact that the coalition came to an agreement with the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Tony Burke. This was in exchange for an agreement to remove the 40 per cent AQIS export service rebate with an eventual move to full cost recovery. A $127.4 million package was supposed to be offered to the industry to fund efficiency reforms. The government has not, as we know, fulfilled its side of the agreement. There has been no independent study of the legitimate costs of government as agreed by the minister. None of the reforms and efficiencies will actually be delivered by the time the rebate cuts out. Some of the review of the reforms of the industries to increase efficiency actually led to more costs, more paperwork and more bureaucracy, contrary to the aims of the review. There is more than one industry involved here. It is not just the beef industry. It is the horticulture, meat, dairy, grains, fish and live animal industries. There was an understanding by the industry that these reforms would have been completed by the time the rebate period ran out, but this clearly has not happened. While I am speaking on this issue, as a dairy and beef farmer myself I want to touch on an issue that I would very much like the minister to address. It is the issue of industrial action taken by AQIS vets in the export abattoirs in my electorate, such as V and V Walsh and Harvey Beef. V and V Walsh sent me a letter recently. It said: V & V Walsh Proprietary Limited, in operation since 1957, has never in its history had its day-today meat processing operations interrupted by industrial action. The company has been made aware about protected industrial action by members of the Commonwealth Public Sector Union who perform the on-plant task of meat inspection under the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service and is likely to occur on site in coming weeks. The company is likely to be subject to work stoppages each day which will impose significant financial hardship on both the company and its employees. Over the past three months the company has been operating on a fourand three-day week due to a range of issues and is just beginning to increase its production. The disruptions will not only have financial implications but the flow-on affects for export production, storage, transportation and customer distribution will be a costly, unforeseen add-on which will have significant impacts on the company and its daily operations. This is a major issue in my electorate which has been going on for nearly six weeks. It affects not only the abattoirs but their workers and their families, those on single incomes and I understand that these are now four-hourly rolling stoppages. So this is a very serious issue for each of the individuals, as it is to the workers and their families. I call on the minister to resolve this issue. I really want to know what is the basis of the industrial action by the AQIS inspectors? What impacts dopes the minister consider this is having on the abattoir management, on the economics and on the workers? I would really like to know whether worker's incomes geed adversely affected and to what degree and what action has the minister MAIN COMMITTEE taken to resolve this dispute. As we know, meat processing can be an extremely finite business. We also know how important it is in regions like our own, particularly given the impacts of the reaction the government had to the banning of live exports. It has had an impact right throughout the whole of the south-west as well as in the north-west of our state. I do notice that the Beale quarantine and biosecurity review commissioned by Labor called for hundreds of millions of dollars to be spent on AQIS and quarantine annually just to provide real and proper protection for our nation's borders, but instead of responding to this report, the government has failed to act, expect to spend the 2½ years since its release running down the report and stripping out its assets. Australian agriculture and food producers rely on our clean green image and on our capacity to produce some of the best quality food in the world. Agricultural production in this country drives $155 billion a year in economic production, which is over 12 per cent of GDP. This generates about 1.6 million Australian jobs and $32 billion a year in farm exports. And we do not always compete on a level playing field. It is very important that we do everything we can to protect our borders and our biosecurity. It should not be underestimated. Anyone who lives in a regional area does not underestimate the importance of the beef industry and even the industries mentioned in this report. I have beef, dairy and horticulture in my electorate. I do not have grains but certainly I have horticulture, meat, dairy, fish and live animals represented in my electorate. So the issues that the member for Calare has raised in his private members motion are extremely relevant to growers and to the industries in my electorate. In relation to the AQIS vet issue, the minister does need to respond. There have been six weeks now of this particular action. It is having an impact on the families in my electorate. It is having an impact on the businesses in my electorate and each one of those needs to get on with what they do best. I call on the minister to act. What action has the minister taken to resolve this dispute? What is he intending to do so that not only the abattoirs but the workers and the communities surrounding them can continue to do what they do best? I finish my speech by simply saying that I support the motion by the member for Calare. The issue of the legitimate costs to government of AQIS export service inspection fees and charges is not just for one single industry; it is for all of those mentioned. As I said, we have half a dozen different industries: the fish industry, the dairy industry, the meat industry, the horticultural industry, the grain industry and the live export industry. These are not resolved yet. In the same way as the industry action in my electorate with the AQIS inspectors has not been resolved, these broader issues have also not been resolved by the minister. I call on the minister to act on all of these issues. We should not take this industry for granted. This industry has done it particularly tough. A number of the growers have found continuing to produce some of high-quality produce very tough in the circumstances that they have found themselves in. four years I have been in this place I have seen some conservative claptrap and Tory tosh but this motion takes the cake.

371,Mr Neumann (Blair) (22:01,"I oppose this AQIS export service rebate motion. In theand Jobs Plan we have had. Now we have the member for Wannon taking credit for $25.8 million when they have not even supported it. They finally came grudgingly to the table and now say they support it. They are taking credit for it when they did not actually support it in the first place. They say one thing here and go back to their electorates and say another thing. This motion is such a waste. We could be doing so much good. We have had a motion this evening about a national disability insurance scheme. We have had bipartisan support for that scheme. There are motions on lots of important issues. This is such rubbish. The coalition has grudgingly now come to the party and announced it will support the regulations that underpinned the reform. This has been a collective effort between industry and the federal Labor government. On5 September we announced that we would implement the Australian Export Meat Inspection System from 1 October 2011. We have provided $25.8 million in transitional assistance. I did not see that budgeted in the coalition's $11 billion black hole when they were wanting to come into government before the last election. I did not hear them talking about that at any stage. As a number of speakers from this side have said, we have invested $127.5 million over three years for export certification reforms and, as the member for Page said, $85 million in export certification rebates. This motion tonight is another example of the coalition's constant carping, moaning and bleating. They give the impression that something is wrong when in fact it is not. The government and industry are working together to build regional jobs and support the industries that previous speakers on the opposite side have talked about by cutting red tape and getting rid of prescriptive rules-making sure we get rid of the bureaucracy-and making sure our agricultural, horticultural and meat export industries are as efficient and effective as they possibly can be. The member for Calare has form. He was rolled by the Liberals with respect to the dangerous legislation to ban New Zealand apples, which would have put at risk Australia's $32 billion agricultural exports industry. Now he is looking around for a degree of relevance, so he has put forward this motion. The only risk to the meat industry in this country is from those opposite. This is typical of the National Party. We are used to it in Queensland. When they get back to their electorates they are all sympathetic and sensitive but down here they will follow the Liberals mindlessly. That is exactly what they are like. We have made a big difference in this industry. It is an industry that is particularly important in my electorate, because I have meat works such as Kilcoy, which supports about 750 jobs; Coominya; Churchill, a small meat works which deals mainly with domestic work; and, of course, the largest meat processing plant in the country, owned by JBS Australia, at Dinmore, where I started my working life as a cleaner. The CEO, John Berry, who is a member of the Australian government's meat ministerial task force, has informed me that, as of 1 October this year, JBS will implement the Australian Meat Inspection System, AEMIS, in 11 processing sites across the country. Under the current certification system, JBS would have paid $15 million in AQIS inspection charges. Under the new model, with the $20 million three-year assistance package, they will pay $9 million. The minister is conducting similar consultations with various sectors. These reforms will take place sector by sector. The member for Calare has been informed of this. Once again, he is playing politics. He is trying to drive the wrecking ball of negativity from those opposite through our reforms. Those opposite are simply miffed that Australia's meat exporters, whom MAIN COMMITTEE they believe should be their good mates, colleagues and comrades, are negotiating and making arrangements with a federal Labor government. It is all about the Nationals over there and the Liberals from the country areas being miffed that their people are dealing with a federal Labor government. The meat exporters overwhelmingly support the outcome announced by the minister in early September. The member for Calare has come to the party. He now says he will support it. But you would not know that if you listened to the drivel he was going on with. There is mindless negativity stamped all over this motion. When it comes to good policy, those opposite have been found wanting on this motion and on so many others. Of course, this motion is from the same people who stripped millions of dollars out of the biosecurity system when they sold off Australia's post-entry quarantine facilities in 2001 and then leased them back. This federal Labor government is committed to reforming our biosecurity system because we know that regional Australians rely on a strong biosecurity system for their livelihood. It is obvious that the previous coalition government was more committed to eroding the national asset base. Under the watch of members opposite a string of foreign pests invaded Australia-pests that continue to plague numerous parts of my home state. Now my constituents now find their livelihoods under threat from the Asian honey bees, fire ants and equine influenza. In 2007, then Prime Minister John Howard admitted they had been warned about changes to the quarantine laws which would allow equine flu into the country. The Leader of the Nationals, a previous agriculture minister, received letters from the Australian Racing Board warning of the potential dangers in 2004 and 2005. So those opposite, when it comes to a whole range of agricultural industries-horticulture, racing, a whole host of areas-have failed. I cannot count the number of speeches I have heard from National Party members opposite in which they have rabbited on about honey bees, but the truth is those opposite did nothing to eradicate them when they were in power. It is their policy, they say, to return to full recovery with respect to this particular issue, but they are bereft of ideas on how to do it. They might as well throw theMr Haase: Madam Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene to ask a question. opposite have not given any indication of how they would fund the 40 per cent AQIS export rebate that the member for Calare was talking about. Perhaps it is going to be thrown into the $70 billion black hole, or maybe the $11 billion black hole they had at the last election. As I said, they have cobbled together this motion to distract us from the fact that they did nothing during the 11½ years there were in power to address the failures in Australia's biosecurity system. And they have done nothing in opposition. They are a policy-free zone on this issue-not just policy-free, but funding-free, because they have not come up with any ideas as to how they would fund any of these sorts of things. Since becoming the shadow spokesperson, the member for Calare has not put forward a single proposal-not one proposal-for how to make AQIS's service delivery more efficient. Those opposite are not fair dinkum about supporting our initiatives for export certification reforms. Why? Because good policy is something that is entirely gone from their agenda. They have no interest in it. Motions like this clearly show that that is the case. We are doing work with the industry, and MAIN COMMITTEE",302,Private Members Business

Thoseon 6 September-let's talk about the facts, not the fiction-Gary Burridge from the Australian Meat Industry Council and the minister announced a new regulatory reform for meat exports: the Australian Meta Export Inspection System, which would be implemented on 1 October 2011 along with, as I mentioned before, the $25.8 million in Australian government funding to support the transition to new arrangements. The industry supported it. AMIC, Gary Burridge, the chair of the ministerial task force, said, 'AMIC will work closely with the Australian government as we implement the new system.' That is what it is all about. They hate the fact that people they believe belong to them are working with the federal Labor government. That is what this motion is all about. It is an attempt by the member for Calare to be relevant. They hate the fact that an industry that they feel should be supporting them is working with the federal Labor government. I oppose the motion. who is leaving the chamber as quickly as he possibly can, that he entirely misses the point of this motion. This is about the fact that this government and the previous minister had promised support for the industry in return for these changes. I will expand on that later, but the fact is that the government has again welshed on their promise. I thank the member for Calare for raising this important issue. Australia has a proud export history, and I think it is important to ensure that this country can continue exporting viably into the future. This motion calls on the responsible minister to commission an independent study of legitimate costs to the government of AQIS export service inspection fees and charges for the six affected industries as evidenced at the AQIS/AMIC joint ministerial task force meeting on 7 May 2010. What could be more innocent than asking for an independent study of legitimate costs? This motion also calls on the responsible minister to table in the House a document that explains how the government will provide a reduction in annual regulatory costs to the export industries in the order of $30 million per year from 1 July 2011 and also a document that outlines the completion of reforms that were to be delivered as part of the agreement to remove AQIS export service rebates between the government and the six affected industries, as I mentioned earlier. The motion also calls on the responsible minister to note the above commitments were part of a package agreed by the former minister for agriculture in return for the passage of their legislation to remove 40 per cent of the AQIS export service rebate and calls on the government to continue the AQIS export service rebate until the reforms are delivered, as agreed by this government. The previous Labor government minister responsible for agriculture made promises that to date still have not been fulfilled despite the current minister offering some band-aid assistance. In 2009, the then Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Tony Burke, announced that, in exchange for axing the 40 per cent AQIS service inspection rebate, he would offer the industry a $127.4 million export certification reform package to fund efficient reforms. For two years this government failed to deliver on that promise. The 40 per cent export rebate ceased on 1 July this year, but up until last week there was still no action from the current minister. Because the government had refused to offer assistance to any of the export ministries affected, despite the 2009 promise, John Cobb, the shadow minister for agriculture, introduced this motion. The minister finally last week recognised that there was a MAIN COMMITTEE",304,Private Members Business
374,Mr Secker (Barker,"Opposition Whip) (20:11): I point out to the member for Blair,problem-about time-and announced the establishment of a $25.8 million package for the meat export industry. This is a small contribution to fix the large problem caused by this government. More needs to be done. The minister has only offered to the meat industry a package where there are five other industries affected by the removal of the 40 per cent rebate-horticulture, dairy, fish, grain and live export. This package offered by the government only covers a small section of the reforms promised in 2009. An established pork abattoir in my electorate has raised concerns about the government's lack of reform also. The pork industry is required to pay 100 per cent of meat inspection costs with no government contribution. The regulatory costs are a huge burden to the business on top of the removal of the rebate from 1 July 2011. The majority of pork export abattoirs have successfully operated under the meat safety export program for the last 13 years and frankly this package that the government has announced will do nothing to assist abattoirs such as the one I have mentioned. In fact this government could do very well to cost the abattoirs such as this one one more. (Time expired) this opportunity just to focus for a while on a very good success story that this government has. I will outline the success story in my speech. In around two weeks time a brand-new food safety regulatory system is coming into force and it will be a world first. It is designed to give local producers, local industry, local workers much better control over their product, their workforce and the success of their export lines. This is the substance of the motion before us and yet those opposite have chosen to focus on something else again on themselves. That is no real surprise here. My colleagues have spoken and we heard previously many of them speak on these distractions that are already taking place. The great reform that is the substantive subject of this motion is exemplified by the new Australian Export Meat Inspection System. It is considered great and it is a great shift from the past, a great opportunity for current and new employers and industry players and also a great example of how Labor and industry work together to achieve superior outcomes for all those involved. The reforms we focused on are broad applying to a range of foods but with the very limited time. I have in this speech this evening I will only be able to focus on the example of a seismic change that is occurring within the meat export industry. Graintec Scientific have referred to this overhaul as the most significant reform in decades. Australian Meat Industry Council manager Steve Martin describes the reform as the culmination of five years of AQIS and AMIC work on maximising efficiency and productivity replacing a system based on the world of some 30 or 40 years ago. He said: We needed something that better reflected the needs of 2011 export market access. I am not quoting the minister there these are the words of Steve Martin manager of the Australian Meat Industry Council. This is a fact that the government has known to be correct. This is the goal that this government has striven to achieve. This is the outcome that this government will deliver next month. Industry support for this change is evident in the Australian Meat Industry Council's presentation of the 2011 Red Meat processing innovation award to a Queensland family run meat processing company called Nolan Meats. This award was presented less than two weeks ago on 7 September. Nolan Meats was presented with this prestigious award for what Beef Central describes as: MAIN COMMITTEE",305,Private Members Business
375,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (20:16,"I really do thank the opposition for giving us… its work in pioneering the application of food safety reform under the ground-breaking Australian Export Meat Inspection System. SoI want to read into Hansard some of Beef Central's account of Nolan's meats historic success piloting the new Australian export meat inspection system: Nolan Meats has long had a goal to gain access to all international markets, with company people fulfilling the meat inspection role. It saw such a move as simultaneously providing a stronger career path for personnel, and greater flexibility and efficiency within the role carried out by meat inspectors. ""Most importantly we believe AEMIS enhances product safety,"" company director Tony Nolan said. ""It's about building-in quality at all points of the supply chain to reduce costs: not putting faith in government to 'inspect quality in' at greater cost, at just a couple of points in the chain."" ""Quality and safety are our responsibilities under the system,"" Mr Nolan said. ""Having our own personnel take ownership and responsibility for meat inspection enables us to have a QA culture that embraces 'total accountability' instead of the government's 'all authority and no accountability' culture,"" Mr Nolan said. As a result, productivity has been greatly improved, by having meat inspectors multi-tasking and performing all or part of other tasks necessary to allow smooth and efficient production flow. It also allowed valuable feedback to be transferred back up the supply chain where problems were identified. The company has now achieved market access to countries that had been considered, under Australian Government Market Access terms, to be 'too sensitive' for the new AEMIS system. These included Japan, Taiwan and Korea. All costs were borne entirely by the company and it says it expects to achieve a five-fold return on its investment. So we have evidence of the potential for productivity gains, and while my colleagues have talked a lot about the meat industry, it continues (Time expired) concern in this whole issue is that the government has not honoured a commitment. I still believe in a sense of honour being displayed in this place. In 2009 the Senate disallowed moves by the Rudd Labor government to axe the AQIS export certification rebate, which was worth approximately $40 million annually, depending on the amount of produce exported. The coalition came to an agreement with the former minister for agriculture in exchange for an agreement to remove 40 per cent AQIS export service rebate with an eventual move to full cost recovery. Mr Burke offered industry $127.4 million package to fund efficiency reforms. Mr Burke claimed that his export certification reform package would make reform of the AQIS export certification program a main priority. In addition, he also committed to a study by an independent authority that would examine the legitimate cost to government of inspections. In a letter of agreement signed by Minister Burke he stated: Successful implementation of these reforms will provide a reduction in annual regulatory costs to the export industries in the order of $30 million per year from 1 July 2011. It will also provide the opportunity for removal of substantial costs from the export supply chain for industry and AQIS. Well, guess what. That has not happened. The government have reneged on a deal and we have to listen tonight to drivel from the government about how this is about other things and it is about who is mates with whom and whether or not the industry is currying favour now with the ALP instead of its traditional supporters in the coalition. That is irrelevant. What is pertinent here is the fact that the government committed to a deal and government have not honoured that deal. And that is what I personally find MAIN COMMITTEE",306,Private Members Business

And the industry has now in the latest move agreed to a compromise situation that will allow the meat aspect of the industry to move ahead, to clear out some of the cobwebs of the past, to clear some of the costs as they now move to self-trained, selfemployed veterinary inspectors et cetera in the industry. What about the other five industries that have been left out in the cold in this regard? What about the fishing industry? The dairy industry? The horticulturalists? The grain industry? The live export industry? The live export industry knows where it stands with this government-slaughtered. We know that the horticultural industry is trying to make a positive move in solving the global food delivery situation. They are trying to expand export businesses. They are trying to grow products that are suitable for the export market. They are trying to analyse and develop those markets overseas and do they get assistance from this government in line with this commitment package? No, they do not. That is my concern. There seems to be a great deal of concern and lip service to the repartee in this debate but no-one is really concerned about who is hurting out there in industry; who is looking for a break so their effort is represented and supported by government by equal effort? It is a tough game developing new markets, especially in horticulture. My mob from the Ord, my mob from the Gascoyne in Carnarvon are trying to expand their horticultural markets because they are prepared to make a quid and put in the extra hard yards to develop Australian exports. They get no help whatsoever from this government because the government sees it all as populace moves and if they can win the votes by making a popular decision, that is what is important to them. I can tell you from my growers, and it is horticulturalists I am speaking of specifically here, that there is no support coming from government and support is needed. When you are trying to compete in a global market a long way from home, you need all the support you can get. Some support from this government would be support, so I support this bill. It is a necessary wake-up call to government. Something ought to be done; the minister ought to do the honourable thing and step up to the plate. (Time expired) Calare. As he well knows, the minister has in fact arranged briefings for him on the status of the meat industry and has also advised him that the government is continuing to work on a sector-by-sector basis on the necessary reforms to the agricultural sector of this country. The member for Calare has been made aware of that and could take up the opportunity of the briefings that the minister has arranged for him. In the year 2000 the coalition government introduced a cost recovery for export services and while it later introduced a 40 per cent rebate on export services costs, this was a temporary rebate that should have lapsed. The fact of the matter is that when the member for Wide Bay was in the cabinet the Howard government had intended the rebate would finish in June 2008. It had made no provision whatsoever for it in the forward estimates. Mr Haase: Madam Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene. on this matter. It is interesting that neither did the National Party's 2000 election platform make any financial provision for the continuation of that rebate.

My time is being wasted in terms of my opportunity to speaka cumbersome certification system and agreed to provide transitional funds to extend the rebate until 30 June 2011 whilst developing reforms to enable industry and AQIS to introduce efficiencies to become more internationally competitive. That is typical of the National Party in government. As far as Australia's biosecurity system was concerned they were all talk and no action. When the leader of the Nationals was at the cabinet table he agreed to sell off all of Australia's post entry quarantine facilities, stripping hundreds of millions of dollars out of a future budget. I repeat it will cost the Australian taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars to reinstate Australia's post entry quarantine facilities sold by the leader of the Nationals with no regard for changes in land use, no plan for maintaining and apparently no regret for putting Australia's agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries, Australia's research community and Australia's medical practitioners without a guarantee of continued access to the best genetic resources in the world. Since he became the spokesman, the member for Calare has not provided one suggestion for how Australia could improve its quarantine and biosecurity system. He has not secured one single dollar in the shadow cabinet to reform Australia's quarantine system in the way it needs to be. It is all right to come into this place and argue for changes, but I suggest that the first place he should argue for those changes and secure them is within his own party room. He has not done that. He simply came here quite clearly as a stunt to try and appease people in his own electorate. As usual, the Liberal Nationals left the hard work of reform to the Labor Party. Not only is the Labor Party delivering, we are doing a better job than those opposite could do. In December 2009, the Labor government commenced the $127.8 million export certification reform package to develop a modern export certification system that maintains Australia's reputation as a producer of high-quality safe food products. The government established six task forces to develop and deliver reforms and efficiencies to the system. If the member for Calare wants to find out about this legitimate costs of government then he need only visit the departmental website where he will find a report which the department commissioned as agreed by the former minister-that is, Minister Burke. It is an independent review of AQIS fees and charges. If those opposite want an update on the progress of all of those activities of the task forces they need simply visit the department's website. It is all there for them to see. Meanwhile the Gillard government is getting on with the business of implementing better government service delivery for Australia's food exporters. A fortnight ago, the Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and the Australian Meat Industry Council announced the commencement of the Australian export meat inspection system together with up to $25.8 million in funding to support the transition to the new system. The Gillard government will continue to provide the most cost effective flexible export certification system that can be implemented whilst maintaining export market confidence. The Gillard government is getting on with the job of improving service delivery and jobs in regional Australia. expired.

380,The Deputy Speaker ( Mrs D'ath,"Order! The time allotted for this debate hasSurf-Lifesavers Debate resumed on the motion by Mr Lyons: That this House: (1) acknowledges the: (a) surf lifesavers who risked their lives to perform approximately 11,000 rescues in Australia last year; and (b) work done by surf lifesavers in northern Australia as its surf season comes to an end; (2) recognises the: (a) importance of water safety in Australia as we head into the warmer months in the southern parts of Australia; and (b) vital work of Surf Life Saving Australia and its efforts in patrolling our beaches and educating swimmers; and (3) encourages all: (a) Australians to learn to swim so that every Australian is a swimmer and every Australian swimmer a lifesaver; and (b) users of aquatic environments, such as pools, rivers, lakes and the surf, to understand those environments and be safe as they swim. Saving Australia. For more than 100 years, Australians and tourists have been drawn to Australia's beaches. With an estimated 100 million beach visitations each year, safety on the beach is vital. As I have stated before, Surf Life Saving is an active part of Australia's local communities. Our movement prides itself in offering mateship, education and experience. In doing so, it is giving back to the community. I am proud to be a member of both the Bridport and Launceston Surf Life Saving clubs in Tasmania. I have had a long association with the movement. Surf Life Saving Australia has played a valuable role in reducing the number of deaths in our coastal waters. It has provided a safe and educational environment for all ages to enjoy on Australia's popular coastline. Its work is to be commended. Unfortunately there are still some tragedies in our waters. Surf Life Saving Australia released its 2011 National Coastal Safety Report last week. Among the key findings of the report was that there were 61 coastal drowning deaths last year. However, this is below the seven-year average of 89. Fifty-two, or 85 per cent, were males; 14, or 23 per cent, were aged between 20 and 29 years, the most common age group; 21, or 34 per cent, were of foreign ethnicity of which five per cent were international visitors. Over 40 per cent occurred during summer which is why I want to highlight this topic now as we are coming into the warmer months. Nineteen, or 31 per cent, were attributed to swimming or wading; 17, or 28 per cent, were attributed to boating; and six, or 10 per cent, were attributed to rock fishing. Out of all our coastal drownings, 12, or 20 per cent, were attributed to rip currents. Education is important in avoiding these tragic drownings. Forty-eight per cent of drownings occurred at the beach and 22 of the victims lived less than 10 kilometres from their drowning location. Thirty-one drownings occurred less than five kilometres from a lifesaving service. Peter George, the Chief Operating Officer, noted that there was a downward trend in coastal drowning deaths over the past seven years. We need to be out there educating communities about how to be MAIN COMMITTEE",309,Private Members Business
381,Mr Lyons (Bass) (20:32,"I rise to speak to the motion on the importance of Surf Lifesafe in the water. Peter George also highlighted that men continued to be overrepresented in the coastal drowning data and that this is down to a mixture of bravado and an inflated sense of ability. We are still seeing too many young men's lives cut short. We should be educating our communities about the importance of water safety. I was pleased to host the second meeting of the Parliamentary Friends of Surf Life Saving Australia last Wednesday. We had great attendance by members, senators and their staff. The SLSA President, Graham Ford, Chief Operating Officer, Peter George AM and CEO Brett Williamson OAM presented certificates to members and talked about the national coastal safety policy. In October this year at Parliament House, Surf Life Saving Australia will be releasing a report on the economic contributions of surf lifesaving in Australia. The Parliamentary Friends of Surf Life Saving are encouraged to attend that preview. Something that you can talk about to those in your electorates who have iPhones or iPads is a free application provided by Surf Life Saving Australia called Beachsafe. Beachsafe displays beach safety information for visitors to Australian beaches and provides the day's beach information such as real-time hazards and beach status information when lifesavers are present. Community education plays a vital role in SLSA's aquatic safety. SLSA provides a number of courses to help people understand the surf, along with community courses in first aid and resuscitation. The important message is that the only way to swim safely at a beach is between the flags. We also recommend that people swim with a mate and to refrain from swimming at night and also if they have consumed alcohol. Surf Life Saving is the largest volunteer movement of its kind in Australia, and I would encourage people to join and support the important work of Surf Life Saving. With summer fast approaching and the patrol season commencing, people who want to learn the skills of surf-lifesaving can contact their local club. With the skills I have learnt in Surf Life Saving, I have carried out seven resuscitations, and one of my daughters, Michelle, has successfully resuscitated two people. You could help save the life of someone close to you one day. I encourage people to stay safe at the beach and to donate to and participate in Surf Life Saving. Every Australian should be a swimmer and every swimmer should be a lifesaver. Every Australian can help save a life. motion put forward by the honourable member who has just spoken, the member for Bass. CanI also commend the member for Bass for the fact that he has helped to resuscitate seven people in his service as a lifesaver. That is truly commendable. I think all of us here acknowledge what a fantastic effort that is. Mr Lyons: And lost one. one person. I think that also shows the true impact of this work and how great and important it is, because it is serious business and people can lose their lives.

383,Mr Tehan,"The member for Bass has just interrupted to say that in that process he lostIt gives me great pleasure, as I said earlier, to stand in support of this motion. Early last year, one of the first things I did as the member for Wannon was to have the Leader of the Opposition come down to my electorate. It was fantastic, because I was able to take the Leader of the Opposition to one of my Surf Life Saving clubs, the Port Fairy Surf Life Saving Club. This club has been in operation since roughly 1924 and it has been doing fantastic work since then. The club welcomed the Leader of the Opposition with open arms. It was very much a bipartisan event. There was a bit of a sausage sizzle, and then the Leader of the Opposition went out on a surf boat-out over the waves. I must say that I do not think he had been in one of those boats for about 10 years, but he sat in it and went over the waves like he had been doing it all of his life. I think the rest of us probably would have found it quite an exhausting process but he managed to do it without really taking a breath. It was a fantastic day, and it really hit home to me the important role that surf-lifesavers play. I would like to support the member for Bass in encouraging people in Australia to get involved with their Surf Life Saving club, because the Port Fairy club, for one, has a workload that is falling on fewer and fewer people. They need new members and they need younger members because they are getting to the stage where they are beginning to wonder whether they can patrol that beach for the whole of the summer. I think this is an excellent motion that the member has brought forward. I would once again encourage every Australian to think about joining the local Surf Life Saving club. It is absolutely important work that is done. We have to make sure that like every volunteer organisation the workload is not left for a diminishing few. We especially need to encourage the younger generations-and I take that as my generation and those below-to make sure they continue to get involved with community organisations because it is absolutely vital work that they do. In my electorate we also have a Surf Life Saving club in Warrnambool. I was very privileged to go there and help open a new room they have just built at the Warrnambool Surf Life Saving Club. It has been in operation since 1930. They do terrific work there as well. It is a fantastic club. It has terrific facilities and it is a fantastic beach. As a matter of fact, it is such a terrific beach because not only can people swim at it but they still take the local horses there to train them. It is a terrific multiuse of the beach. It has led to Warrnambool now being one of the best training facilities in Victoria. Port Campbell also has a terrific Surf Life Saving club and they do terrific work there. Once again, it has got one of the best views, as most Surf Life Saving clubs do, of the coastal area and the magnificent coastal area that goes along the southern border of my fantastic electorate. In summary, I once again reiterate what the member for Bass has said. Surf-lifesaving is a great volunteer activity. We need to encourage more and more people to get involved. As summer approaches, if we could all take a step back and think, 'Do we have the time?' and, if we can, get involved with surf-lifesaving. Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (20:42): I rise in support of this very important motion which goes to acknowledging the great work of our surf-lifesavers and highlighting the importance of water safety. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the member for Bass for bringing this important matter to the attention of the House. MAIN COMMITTEE This motion rightly acknowledges surf-lifesavers who risk their lives to perform rescues in Australia every year but in particular last year, and also recognises the contribution of surflifesavers in Northern Australia as their surf season comes to an end. Surf-lifesavers have been protecting the lives of beachgoers for over a century. Surf Life Saving is one of Australia's largest volunteer organisations with a total membership of around 130,000 and an active team of around 40,000 people who patrol our coastline on a regular basis. It is estimated that surf-lifesavers spend more than a million hours patrolling our beaches each year. If you think about it, a million hours is such an incredible contribution: patrolling our beaches, performing rescue operations and using support services such as helicopters and rescue boats. Together each year surf-lifesavers rescue around 11,000 people, provide emergency care to 35,000 and give safety advice to more than 600,000. These dedicated Australian volunteers spend their time creating a safe environment around our beaches through patrols and education initiatives. When faced with hazardous and potentially life-threatening scenarios, surf-lifesavers frequently demonstrate exceptional courage and skill in order to protect and save the lives of their fellow Australians. I cannot speak highly enough of the selfless men and women who give up their own time to protect and save and promote life along our coastline. In my electorate we have five great Surf Life Saving clubs and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all the members and volunteers at Aldinga Bay Surf Life Saving Club, Moana Surf Life Saving Club Southport, Surf Life Saving Club, Port Noarlunga Surf Life Saving Club and Christies Beach Surf Life Saving Club, which I have the privilege of also being a member of. This motion recognises the importance of water safety as we head into the warmer months in the southern parts of Australia. Taking the family for a day at the beach is part and parcel of the Australian way of life and I would certainly encourage everyone to come down to my electorate, which has 31 kilometres of beach on pristine coastline. However, while we have some beautiful beaches it is also vital to remember that we must stay vigilant about water safety. Unfortunately, in my electorate we have had a tragic start to the warmer months with a scuba diver drowning at Port Noarlunga only a few days ago. The stark reality is that beaches are dangerous environments and the demand for vigilance is important for every Australian. The National Coastal Safety Report compiled by Surf Life Saving Australia, released last week, reported a total of 61 coastal drowning deaths between 2010 and 2011. While this figure is below the seven-year average of 89, which I think is really important to note, it remains that every life lost is one too many. The report also reveals that almost 50 per cent of drowning deaths occurred five kilometres or more from the nearest surf-lifesaving station. These figures suggest that surf-lifesavers are an effective means of preserving the life of swimmers. The motion also urges 'users of aquatic environments', including 'pools, rivers, lakes and the surf', to understand that those environments are dangerous and to exercise caution. Drowning does not just happen at the beach or in swimming pools. It can happen in rivers, in creeks, in streams, in lakes, in dams or in lagoons. One disturbing trend has seen a substantial increase in the proportion of drownings occurring in the over-55 age group and in the under-five age group. Learning to swim is a really important part of the Australian lifestyle. I would certainly encourage people to take advantage of the wide range of educational programs available through Surf Life Saving MAIN COMMITTEE Australia. I note that the motion does urge people to think about learning to swim and I would like to say-given my previous life as a swimming teacher, having taught mums and bubs classes as well as adult learn-to-swim classes and everything in between-it is never too late to learn how to swim. I say to anyone out there that improved water confidence could be the thing that saves your life. I would like to conclude by again commending the member for Bass on this motion which provides a valuable opportunity to recognise the wonderful work of our surf-lifesavers in protecting lives at the beach. Also, it provides a timely reminder to all Australians to ensure that they are water smart, as summer sets in in the southern areas of Australia, and to listen to the advice of surf-lifesavers and always swim between the flags. Ms O'DWYER (Higgins) (20:47): I would like to commend the member for Bass for bringing forward this motion about surf-lifesavers. It is a very important motion. I rise to speak on it because the history of Higgins is inextricably linked to one of the most tragic events in our nation's history, the loss of Prime Minister Harold Holt, at Cheviot Beach in 1964. Harold Holt, as all of you would know, was a former member for Higgins and he brought, through this tragic event, into the nation's consciousness the danger of our waters and our beaches. The beach culture is one of the defining features that make Australia the greatest place in the world in which to live. Be it the calm waters of Port Phillip Bay on a summer's day right through to the world-famous surf beaches of Bells Beach and Bondi Beach, surf, sand and sun are iconic elements of the Australian social and cultural fabric. However, with these simple pleasures come inherent dangers and that is why I stand to applaud and pay tribute to one of the very significant volunteer organisations in this country, Surf Life Saving Australia. This volunteer organisation has been with us for over 100 years. The first lifesaving group appeared at Bondi Beach in 1907. It quickly developed into nine affiliated groups around Sydney beaches and by the 1930s state organisations had been established in New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland. By 1952 all states had established their own associations and today there are over 307 clubs nationwide including 57 in my own state of Victoria. The organisation still operates on a volunteer basis with around 15,000 active volunteers registered. This is truly an inspiration. As with other emergency services, there is no higher calling than to risk one's own life to save another, and we have heard from the member for Bass about his experiences in this regard. The ability to see somebody in danger, identify that risk and run towards that risk in order to save them is something that is truly noble. On most recent figures in Victoria we know that there were over 423 rescues performed last year, and 1,190 people required first aid, delivered by lifesavers. Thankfully, according to this year's national coastal safety report, drowning deaths are down. But even though those deaths are down-as has been so eloquently mentioned by my colleague just before-one drowning death is one too many. It is important to understand and become confident around water. That is why the junior lifesaving organisation, the Nippers, is so important. It involves over 8,000 kids aged six to 13. This is also run by volunteers who give up their time on the weekends and during holidays to teach children about water safety and surf rescue. Being a land girt by sea, sea salt is in our veins. From Ian Thorpe to Grant Hackett, swimming is a key component of the Australian way of life. Just like these champions, swimming must be taught at an early age to help reduce the risk of any potential disaster. MAIN COMMITTEE While it is important to know about water around beaches, it also terribly applicable around the home as well because tragedies are not limited to beaches alone. In fact, half of all drownings for children aged between one and four occur at the family home. According to KidsHealth.org, children can drown in water as shallow as six centimetres. That is why I am helping to promote the Kids Alive-Do the Five program coordinated by legendary swimming coach Laurie Lawrence in my electorate of Higgins. The DVD produced by Laurie Lawrence and the government outlines the five necessary steps to ensure kid safety around water. It is something that I will definitely be promoting even more actively in the lead-up to summer later this year. Of course, learning to swim is not simply about survival. Swimming is a fantastic way to stay fit. The beauty of swimming is that all you need is a body of water. Swimming can also be very social. In my final moments I want to mention the Malvern Marlins. The Marlins consist of two groups: over-20s and seniors. Both groups compete in a number of national competitions and have a rich history of success, taking home a number of trophies. Beyond competing they also get involved in social activities, with frequent dinners, barbecues and events being a common occurrence. I want to finish by highlighting the volunteer nature of surf-lifesavers. Volunteers are the glue that binds our society together. Giving one's time to serve others without seeking reward is a truly gracious calling and its significance cannot be overestimated in the complex tapestry that is Australia. member for Bass, who has a lifetime of involvement in surf-lifesaving in his sporting life. He is a passionate advocate. He had a lot to do with surf-lifesaving in my electorate of Braddon-when he did not need permission to come into Braddon! On my staff, Kay Eastley is a dedicated surf-lifesaver and is an example of the many volunteers that make up seven of Tasmania's 14 clubs on the north-west coast of Tasmania in my electorate of Braddon. I want to thank each and every one of those surf-lifesavers, as my colleagues on both sides of the House have been thanking those representatives of surf-lifesaving clubs in their electorates on this motion tonight. Australians love the water. We have been attracted to the coast for a long time-over a hundred years. We have something like a hundred million beach visitations per year, something like 11,600 beaches and 36,000 kilometres of coastline, some of the best of which are in Tasmania. Since 1907, Surf Life Saving has done everything possible to help educate our communities about water safety and also have patrolled our beaches and our coastlinesnone more so than on the north-west coast of Tassie. In Tasmania there are 14 clubs: of those, Boat Harbour, Burnie, Devonport, Penguin, Port Sorell, Somerset and Ulverstone are on the north-west coast. Just for the record, and proudly so, 99 lifesaving rescues were made last year in Tasmania, 350 first aid treatments were administered and 1,931 preventative actions were taken to avoid tragedies from happening in the first place. Those statistics are very admirable, but nationwide, just as in Tasmania, there is a lot more that we need to do. Any assistance that surf-lifesaving clubs can receive from communities and from government in particular is very well used. I will demonstrate this with an example. A recent merger of offshore rescue groups has seen Surf Life Saving Tasmania grow to 15 clubs and services, and some affiliates, I must add, and is now capable of MAIN COMMITTEE",311,Private Members Business

To complement these services a state-wide 13 SURF phone activation system has been introduced in conjunction with a radio repeater network linking all clubs and services. This has enabled effective and efficient coordination of the state's clubs and services and 3,000 volunteers for any aquatic incidents. This future lifesaving repeater network was enabled using federal black spot funding. This three-year federal black spot drowning intervention program has contributed to a significant reduction in drowning across the nation, not just in Tassie, with figures coming down from 81 to 61 in the past two years through programs introduced by Surf Life Saving Australia. Tasmania unfortunately has one of Australia's highest drowning rates-3.5 per 100,000 people per annum-which highlights the need for further funding for continuation of appropriate drowning intervention programs in Australia. Being an island state, we have 1,269 accessible beaches, let alone other waterways and dams, and thousands of potential drowning areas. Finally, this summer will see the launch of a purpose-built all-weather jet rescue boat on Tasmania's north-west coast, complementing existing police vessels in Circular Head and Devonport. The vessel is capable of shallow water and large surface rescue. The craft can be launched in very adverse conditions and is a welcome addition to our beautiful yet occasionally treacherous coast. Again, I thank all those members of Surf Life Saving Australia and Surf Life Saving Tasmania for volunteering their services and doing such a marvellous job. I thank the member for Bass for his abiding interest in surf-lifesaving matters Australia-wide in this parliament and in Tasmania. place about some of the surf clubs on the southern Gold Coast. TodayI would like to go into some further detail about some of the ventures that are currently being undertaken by the Surf Life Saving Queensland Point Danger Branch. The Point Danger Branch is entering its 88th year and as a branch supports 11 of the 13 surf-lifesaving clubs within my electorate, including Tallebudgera, Pacific, Palm Beach, Currumbin, Tugun, Bilinga, North Kirra, Kirra, Coolangatta, Tweed Heads and Rainbow Bay. There are a total of approximately 6,796 members of these clubs within the Point Danger Branch and these same members are also teaching local nippers in surf sports as well as training new members so that they have the necessary skills to be able to assist with all aspects of beach patrols. These members are part of one of the largest community volunteer organisations in the country. Recently, eight volunteers from clubs within the Point Danger Branch received awards at the Queensland annual awards dinner. I would like to congratulate Claudia and Sam Fien from Rainbow Bay, Jessica Attenborough from North Kirra, Marsha and Chris Maynard from Currumbin and Anthony Cassone from Kirra. I would especially like to congratulate Bev Walsh from Currumbin and Ray Fien from Rainbow Bay for also winning awards on the night and for being nominated for the national awards in October this year. One of the concerns for surf-lifesaving clubs in general has been the decrease in the number of volunteers. However, the Point Danger Branch membership numbers remain strong and they are proud of the quality of lifesaving services that they provide. In addition to these services, the Point Danger Branch are continually looking at opportunities to get the local community involved. They are putting programs together that include School Surf Talk MAIN COMMITTEE",315,Private Members Business
385,Mrs Andrews (Mcpherson) (20:57,"I recently took the opportunity to speak in thisvisits, youth development initiatives and programs aimed at attracting the retired community into surf lifesaving. The School Surf Talk program has been designed to educate primary and secondary students on surf safety and surf awareness. This program intends to educate around 4,500 Gold Coast students, including students from Caningeraba State School, Currumbin Valley State School, Currumbin Primary State School and Hillcrest Christian College. In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the president of the Point Danger branch, Mal Barnes, along with the deputy president, Tony Wischnevsky, and the rest of their committee for their commitment to the local surf-lifesaving club. I would also like to thank Kerrie Barnes, who manages the branch, for keeping me up-to-date on the branch activities in the local community. Debate adjourned. Debate resumed. That grievances be noted. Adhesive Arachnoiditis situation where potentially thousands of Australians contracted the disease adhesive arachnoiditis after receiving a spinal injection of the chemical dyes Myodil or Pantopaque in the period from 1945 to the late 1980s. I bring to the attention of the House the sense of injustice and abandonment these people feel and to call for a parliamentary inquiry into their situation. At the outset, I would like to thank one of my Queens Park constituents, Mr Max Scott, a sufferer of adhesive arachnoiditis, for bringing this matter to my attention. Mr Scott attributes his contraction of arachnoiditis to his treatment with Myodil at Rivervale hospital in 1977. I would also like to thank the Parliamentary Library for the information that they have provided, which has been of great assistance as I have pursued information from Australian health authorities and as I prepared this speech. Arachnoiditis is a debilitating neurological disease and, I think it would be fair to say, one of the most unpleasant diseases that one could suffer from. The condition itself is an inflammation of the arachnoid membrane. In many people, it affects the nerves running to the lower back and legs. The most common symptom is pain, but arachnoiditis can also cause (1) tingling, numbness or weakness in the legs; (2) sensations that may feel like insects crawling on the skin or water trickling down the leg; (3) severe shooting pain that can be similar to an electric shock sensation; (4) muscle cramps, spasms and uncontrollable twitching; and (5) bladder, bowel and/or sexual dysfunction. In its most severe form, this is an almost unbearable disease and, sadly, there are reports that many sufferers contemplate suicide. It slowly shuts the body down over a period of time. When my constituent first raised this issue with me, he was able to walk into my East Victoria Park electorate office after driving himself from his home in Queens Park. Now, just a short time later, he is wheelchair bound and on the path to becoming a paraplegic. He suffers daily pain and there is little that can be done, as arachnoiditis is largely an incurable disease. MAIN COMMITTEE",316,Private Members Business
386,The Deputy Speaker ( Mrs D'ath,The question is:,317,Grievance Debate
387,Mr Irons (Swan) (21:00,"I rise in this evening's grievance debate to speak about aThere are a variety of causes of arachnoiditis, one being the injection of a foreign substance, such as contrast media, into the spine. Unfortunately, the injection of the contrast media Pantopaque and Myodil, proprietary names of the chemical iophendylate, occurred widely in Australia between the 1940s and the 1980s. Iophendylate was injected into the spine and used as a radiological dye prior to the availability of MRI and CT technology. Once the dangers of the contrast medium and the link to adhesive arachnoiditis became apparent, the drug was withdrawn from the market across the world, but by then the damage had been done. Withdrawal did not occur at the same rate. There were reports that in Sweden it was banned in 1948, while in Australia it died a natural death in the eighties when MRI and CT scanning equipment became more widely used. Many questions have been raised as to how this contrast medium could have continued to be licensed for use in Australia up until the late 1980s. This is a matter that has been raised in parliament before. Indeed, I acknowledge that this is not the first time that there have been calls for such an inquiry in this place. In 2002, the former member for Throsby, Jennie George, introduced a motion calling for an inquiry into this matter. Ms George referred evocatively to a 'conspiracy of silence about the incurable disease adhesive arachnoiditis', which she estimated to affect up to 60,000 Australian citizens. Ms George said questions needed to be answered about how a drug that had been introduced in Australia in 1945 and banned in Sweden in 1948 could have been used widely in Australia until withdrawn in 1987. I note that the current members for Boothby, Moore and Shortland also spoke on the motion. The member for Moore provided some details on the Commonwealth's role, stating: Myodil was on the Australian market from at least 1959 and Pantopaque from at least 1961. Both agents were therefore available before the introduction of a therapeutic regulation program and requirements for premarketing evaluations in 1970. The member for Shortland said that it was absolutely necessary that this is investigated. However, there was no subsequent inquiry, and the issue seems to have been put on the backburner ever since by governments of both persuasions. An inquiry into this issue is long overdue, but now is an appropriate time. The slow decline in health for sufferers has meant that many people who were injected in the seventies and eighties are just beginning to suffer the ostensible effects of this disease today. It is in this context that Mr Scott approached me, asking for my assistance in getting to the bottom of this matter and seeing if there were any action he could take to achieve some assistance from the government. I came to the chamber today to make this speech having made a great number of inquiries on his behalf to the Australian health establishment, and having received unsatisfactory results to date. I want to quickly brief the House on some of this correspondence now. We wrote to the Minister for Health and Ageing on 27 July 2010, and this was responded to on 18 August by the head of the Office of Medicine Authorisation in the Therapeutic Goods Administration. In this reply we were referred to the Medical Board of Australia. Accordingly, I wrote to the Medical Board of Australia on Mr Scott's behalf on 7 September 2010. After some time without a response it was followed up by a personal letter from Mr Scott on 31 October 2010. The response of 10 November referred us on to the Office of Health Review. Accordingly, a third letter was written to Anne Donaldson, director of the MAIN COMMITTEE Office of Health Review on 17 November 2010. She replied on 1 December, stating, 'WhilstI sympathise with Mr Scott's situation, this office is unable to assist him on this occasion. This is because our legislation prescribes that we should not deal with a complaint that is older than 24 months. While there is some discretion available, we are unable to deal with a complaint about matters that occurred prior to 1995.' This handballing from one organisation to another suggests that either these organisations are unaware of their functions or that this is an issue that they just do not want to deal with. I suspect there may be a bit of both going on. Given these unsatisfactory responses, I thought the appropriate course of action to take was to contact the Commonwealth Ombudsman, which I did on 13 January this year. However, to this day I still have not received an official written reply from the Ombudsman and nor has Mr Scott. I am beginning to understand why the member for Throsby in 2002 spoke about a conspiracy of silence. It is this lack of interest and communication that has been an unending source of frustration for those affected by the disease, and it is why I call today on the parliament for an inquiry into this matter. The lack of interest from the Commonwealth Ombudsman is particularly disappointing, given the positive role played by the UK ombudsman in extracting information from Glaxo. According to the Parliamentary Library, an article written by Judy Jones in the British Medical Journal said that a member of the public complained to the ombudsman in 1998 after the UK Medicines Control Agency refused to disclose information about the safety, quality and efficacy of Myodil that had been considered in reaching the decision about the product licence in 1987. After the ombudsman's intervention the agency agreed to disclose a substantial amount of the information about Myodil. As I have mentioned already, it is not just Australia where people were injected with this contrast medium. It happened across the world and, as such, it is worth considering what has happened overseas. In the UK Pantopaque was marketed as Myodil and was withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer, Glaxo, in 1987. According to research undertaken by the Parliamentary Library, Glaxo paid out £11 million in 1995 to 425 claimants in the UK, USA and Australia without accepting liability. The terms of the Glaxo payout were confidential, and there seems to be no information on how compensation has worked or was judged. The case that Glaxo regularly mounts in its defence is that by definition, people who had myelograms were already back sufferers. In the US, where the substance was marketed under the Pantopaque name, the company was successfully sued by one person, but the settlement took place out of court. In New Zealand, the Accident Compensation Corporation made payments to a number of sufferers of iatrogenic arachnoiditis. Payments varied from person to person and, again, the details of the exact payments, the persons to whom they were made and the nature of the evidence available were not in the public domain. Many support groups around the world have made allegations of an alleged conspiracy by manufacturers to continue to promote the use of the agent and compliance by medical staff in maintaining the use of the contrast mediums Myodil and Pantopaque, despite the knowledge of a link with arachnoiditis. I understand that drug companies have settled many legal claims MAIN COMMITTEE in the US, the UK and Australia out of court and on an individual basis, and that lawyers have deemed class action not to be viable. The best committee to look into this matter is the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, of which I am the deputy chair. Fortunately, the chair is in the chair here tonight. I requested of the committee chair that the committee initiate such an inquiry, and spoke in favour of it meeting in March. The committee has agreed to reconsider this as its next major inquiry, and I look forward to this happening. In conclusion, it does seem that, whatever avenue one pursues, there is always a brick wall in the way. Even the Parliamentary Library has reported to my office that it is finding it difficult to get answers to some of its questions. The Prime Minister often talks about tearing down brick walls, and this is an ideal opportunity to do just that. It is time for an inquiry, and I thank you for your time because I have run out of time. Steel Industry recent developments in Australia's manufacturing industry. As members of the House will be aware, the recent announcement of plant closures and job losses at BlueScope Steel is of serious concern on many levels. First and foremost, it is devastating news for the thousands of people who are likely to lose their jobs both at BlueScope and at its suppliers and subcontractors. Secondly, it is a stark warning that the current commodities boom and the high Australian dollar exchange rate are having a severe impact on our non-mining industries, including manufacturing, agriculture and tourism. Thirdly, it is a wake-up call that we need to take action before any damage to those industries becomes irreversible. This includes doing what we can to encourage greater purchasing by both government and private companies from local suppliers. Australian governments from both sides of politics have been thoughtful promoters of free trade, but let us be clear about one thing: many of the world's largest economies and advocates of free trade use domestic content requirements as a way to support their local industry. For example, the country most people associate with the free market, the United States, has a long history of extensive local content requirements for its government purchasing, in particular since the implementation of the Buy American Act in 1933. This legislation was specifically intended to support the US manufacturing industry by ensuring that products used and taxpayer funded projects are sourced from US firms. Most US government projects require at least 51 per cent local content, and some, such as roads and rail, have a 100 per cent local content requirement. What is more, US firms do not even have to match the price of an imported competitor to secure business from the government. Prices charged by large US suppliers can be up to six per cent higher than that for equivalent foreign products before a government department can use cost as a reason for not buying locally. If the product is from small US businesses, the price can be 12 per cent higher than the imported equivalent. In the case of road and rail projects, the Secretary of Transportation has ruled that domestic content must be used unless it costs 25 per cent more than imports. In 2008, the US Government Accountability Office summarised the benefits of these policies as: … protecting domestic employment through national infrastructure improvements that can stimulate economic activity and create jobs; protecting against unfair competition from foreign firms as a result of MAIN COMMITTEE",317,Grievance Debate
388,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (21:10,"I want to use this grievance debate tonight to talk aboutforeign government subsidies; and maintaining national security interests through the continued use and development of certain industries within the US. economy, like the iron and steel industries. Exactly the same argument should apply here in Australia. The economic significance of Australian industry participation extends beyond direct participants in major projects to all of the suppliers and subcontractors involved through the industry supply chains. All levels of government must be committed to maximising the retention of skills and jobs in Australia, and they should gear their procurement practices accordingly, having due regard to the wholeof-life value-for-money considerations and Australia's international trade obligations. Let me give you an illustration from my own electorate of Bendigo. Members will know that the defence manufacturing industry is an important part of Bendigo's economy. One locally based manufacturer, Thales Australia, sets a good example by buying the steel for its Bushmaster protected mobility vehicles from BlueScope Steel. Each Bushmaster contains 15 tonnes of steel. That means 838 vehicles to be supplied to the Australian Defence Force will have generated orders of more than 12,500 tonnes of steel from BlueScope, and that does not include the export orders from the Dutch and the United Kingdom governments. Should Thales be awarded an order for its Bushmaster utility vehicle, each of which contains five tonnes of steel, not only will this create more jobs and retain skills in Australia but a contract for, say, 500 vehicles would result in steel orders of another 2,500 tonnes from BlueScope. This example clearly demonstrates that, when it comes to government procurement, there is more to acting in Australia's national interest than buying from the currently cheapest supplier. While mentioning Thales, I will make one observation about the current light protected vehicle tender which the company will bid for with its Hawkei program. I draw members' attention to an article by Henry Thornton which appeared in the Australian on 6 September. As many members will know, Henry Thornton is the nom de plume of Peter Jonson, a former head of research at the Reserve Bank of Australia and a former candidate for Liberal Party preselection. He is hardly known as a trade protectionist and certainly not known for his radical views. In this article, however, Dr Jonson writes: As long as the possibility of serious global conflict exists, no sensible nation should rely entirely on global free trade, which will immediately be disrupted in any serious conflict. He goes on to say that the process for considering alternatives for the Hawkei is: … no way to treat a strategic Australian defence business. It amounts to anti-protection (giving advantage to foreigners). It is not just government purchasing that is relevant here. Australia's private sector also has to take greater initiative with its procurement. If recent reports about the Australian mining industry sourcing its steel requirements overseas are correct, it is a matter of great concern. While the current mining boom has brought and continues to bring significant benefits for mining companies and their shareholders, its impact on the nation is far more mixed, as the Australia Institute's recent research report has highlighted. According to this report, the mining boom is negatively affecting other sectors of the economy in several ways. These include driving up the exchange rate; driving up the cost of skilled labour for businesses in other sectors; driving up the prices of raw materials used in mining, such as concrete; and driving up the cost of other services, such as construction. MAIN COMMITTEE Despite some of its well-financed propaganda, it appears that mining is not the extensive employer and highly productive industry it likes to claim. It employs just 1.9 per cent of Australian workers, making it a smaller employer than the arts and recreation sector, and its record on productivity is woeful. It is one of the biggest users of, and advocates for, individual employment contracts. Despite this, its labour productivity fell by half between 2000-01 and 2009-10. What makes this result even more startling, according to the Australia Institute report, is that productivity in the rest of the economy is growing rapidly. In other words, the mining industry is holding back improvements to our national productivity, one of the key factors that contributes to increasing a country's standard of living. Furthermore, much of the profit from the mining industry is leaving Australia. In 2009-10, according to the Australia Institute again, mining profits were $51 billion, of which 83 per cent, or $42 billion, accrued to foreign investors. Over the next 10 years, profits from mining are expected to be about $600 billion. If the present levels of foreign ownership continue, about $500 billion of these profits will end up in the hands of overseas shareholders. It is reprehensible that largely foreign owned companies, operating in Australia to take advantage of its political, legal, financial and social stability, should have no qualms about buying from an overseas supplier on the sole basis of short-term cost. If companies wish to operate in this country, they have an obligation to act as responsible corporate citizens and to contribute to furthering Australia's national interests as well as those of their shareholders. The mining industry in particular should be very careful about their behaviour as corporate citizens because, perhaps more than any other industry, they are critically dependent on a social licence to operate. The nature of the industry means it has some inherent drawbacks as far as the wider community is concerned. Exploration and production need to take place where the deposit is, which is often not in the most suitable social, environmental, logistical or economic location. Any suggestion that the mining companies as a group are failing as corporate citizens, including failing to support local suppliers and the wider Australian economy, may have significant long-term negative consequences for their shareholders. I welcome the Prime Minister's remarks at the recent Australian Steel Convention in Canberra. Mining companies that are undermining our manufacturing industries by buying offshore should be publicly named and shamed and I urge her to ensure that this happens as quickly as possible. I encourage all levels of government in this country to review and strengthen their own procurement practices and ensure that local suppliers of products and services are given priority. I encourage more private sector firms to see beyond short-term price when it comes to their buying practices. Home Insulation Program for my constituent Mrs Pamela Ranks. She recently contacted me about the lack of attention given to her home by the Home Insulation Safety Program of the current Gillard Labor government-I say 'current' advisedly. This insulation program may have been forgotten by some but not by some of my constituents, particularly Mrs Pamela Ranks of Pinjarra. For those who need clarification this program runs a check that the insulation installed in people's homes under this failed insulation program is actually safe. On2 March 2011, and I MAIN COMMITTEE",320,Grievance Debate
389,Mr Randall (Canning) (21:19,"I am very pleased to speak in this debate and I grievehave the letter here, Mrs Ranks received a letter from the government's Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. The letter said she would shortly be contacted by telephone with an offer to have the insulation that was installed in the ceiling of her home under the Home Insulation Program inspected. Remember that marvellous program, that beautiful program that was going to save all these greenhouse gases, run by that former magnificent rock star singer, the member for Kingsford Smith, who said he was going to save the world, the one who demonstrated against Pine Gap and all these other things that he did before he became a member of parliament? This is the man who put insulation in a million roofs in Australia and now people are too scared to go into their roof cavities. The letter said, based on the history of pink batts burning, wrecking people's homes and putting lives at risk, that of course Mrs Ranks wants her home inspected. This program, as I have already said, was linked to 200 house fires and four deaths. Four people died as a result of this magnificent program run by the member for Kingsford Smith and it was a disaster. It was a $2.45 billion taxpayer funded program for insulation and it was an absolute disaster. My constituent would like her home inspected and rightly so. She got all the necessary receipts together as was asked of her by this letter from the department on 2 March this year. The work order number was 90128043 and they said they would come and inspect the house. A month later there was no call from the department or any of the contractors undertaking these inspections. When my constituent called the department's contractor a month after not hearing from them she was told, 'Oh no, we're not anywhere near your home yet.' How's that? So six months after that she sent me a letter because there had been no further action on behalf of the Gillard Labor government or its department to ensure that my constituent's home was safe and protected. Let us hope her house is one of the safe ones-one that was not installed by these incompetent installers such as those who stapled through an electrical cable onto a rafter or cut through wiring in the roof. Let us hope it is not one that is sitting there ticking away waiting to burn or electrocute somebody who gets into the roof cavity. It is unbelievable to think after what we have seen go so terribly wrong with the Labor government's dodgy pink batts program that people across Australia could still potentially be sitting in these unsafe homes. It is unbelievable that-knowing what they know, based on the past record of 200 house fires and four lives lost-this Labor government is not doing more to properly complete these inspections in a timely manner. I think they hope that everyone has forgotten about this debacle, this Home Insulation Program, where constituents like mine are sitting on time bombs. They are hoping that events have transcended and moved on for constituents like Pamela Ranks. I have sent a letter to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, the Hon. Greg Combet, on 23 August this year. I wrote to him telling him how concerned I was about this program and that my constituent Mrs Pamela Ranks had received a letter in March, and that in August they were still too far away from inspecting her roof. Today is 19 September and still no reply from the minister. He is not interested in my constituents and their issues. He is more interested in putting a toxic tax on carbon in this country rather than in the real issues surrounding constituents like Mrs Ranks who is very concerned about her live roof, or potential live roof. I expect better from the minister and from this government who told everybody that they were going to save the world with this environmental program. Constituents like mine are very serious and they hope that the minister will respond in a timely way. As I said, he has not responded to my letter and he MAIN COMMITTEE needs to respond promptly to enable Home Insulation Program safety inspections on my constituents' homes. In the time left, I would just say that this is on top of the most recent debacle in the budget this year, the decision to put set-top boxes in people's homes. Whichever genius in the Labor Party came up with the set-top boxes program, I will never know-over $300 for a set-top box for an analog TV! You can actually go to Harvey Norman and get a good LCD TV-high definition with all the tuners-for $300, yet the government want to put a dodgy set-top box on top of an analog TV! They fall in, they fall out, and they pixelate. Put this in the context of really understanding what the Australian community want and then you say: are they really in contact? We have had the live cattle export industry. We have got the current immigration crisis-we were going to East Timor and we are still trying to go to Malaysia. There has been the sabotaging of the Tasmanian forest industry, and the waste of billions of dollars on overpriced school halls, particularly along the east coast-they have been good value for money in Western Australia. There has been the disastrous Cash for Clunkers scheme. Are you getting the picture, Mr Deputy Speaker? This is a government that really lurches from one disaster to another. There is the failed Green Loans scheme, the hundred billion dollars of debt that has been created-they had a positive $25 billion when they came to government. There are the budget deficits. There is the submarine fleet, based in Western Australia, that cannot go to sea. DareI say, this is a government that is a carcass swinging in the breeze, waiting to be chopped down. People like my constituent Mrs Pamela Ranks deserve better. She deserves a response from the minister. I have written to him and he has not even got the decency to respond on behalf of somebody who is very concerned about the safety of her home and her family. Education Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (21:28): I rise tonight to put on the record my support for the government's historic and unequalled reform to the education system of Australia and to discuss the unwarranted and destructive attacks that they have drawn from some members of this place. Education, as I have said so many times before, is an area in which I have a deep and strong commitment. It is a silver bullet for solving problems and all sorts of social and economic issues from health to productivity to employment. All the research shows that the better educated the individual, the happier they are, the healthier they are, and the more productive they are. It is for these reasons that this Labor government has embarked on a series of reforms and programs designed to deliver to every Australian student and every Australian parent an education system for the new millennium, an education system that will deliver a productive, informed and creative population capable of tackling the challenges of today and the unknown challenges of tomorrow. This is a government that has invested in every level of the education system from primary schools to PhDs, a government that supports every student, every apprentice, every parent, every school, every university and every TAFE, to provide an education system that delivers opportunities that change lives permanently. As of July this government has delivered a doubling of funding to schools, investing $60 billion over four years, and record funding through national partnerships to deliver $1.5 billion for disadvantaged schools, $540 million to improve child literacy and numeracy and $550 million to improve teacher quality. We delivered at the end of the June quarter close to 600,000 computers through the national school computer fund MAIN COMMITTEE with many more computers delivered since. We are well on the way to one computer for every Australian student between year 9 and year 12. We are providing greater feedback and transparency to parents through the MySchool website. We are also delivering a national curriculum with my own community here in the ACT already beginning to see the rollout. We have provided $1 billion for 288 projects as part of the Trades Training Centre program which will give school kids access to all sorts of benefits of learning a trade and which addresses the skills shortages facing this country-skills that are in high demand here in Canberra. I am particularly happy with the $5.7 million Trades Training Centre that is based at St Mary Mackillop College in my electorate. This centre is a joint initiative that will benefit not only the students of St Mary Mackillop but also those of St Clare's College, St Francis Xavier College and Merici College. Of course, we have the Building the Education Revolution, the single largest investment in education infrastructure in this country's history, an investment to upgrade school infrastructure to make sure it is equipped for the next century. Every Australian School, some 9,500 schools, has benefited from this program. At the end of May this government had delivered over 4,000 new classrooms and over 5,000 new libraries and multipurpose halls. Those opposite love to deride these programs. At the last election they vowed to end the Trades Training Centre program, costing thousands of students the opportunity to learn a trade. Not a day goes by when they do not take a cheap shot at the Building the Education Revolution program. Their comments and policies just go to show how out of touch they are and how much distance there is between them and the Australian community when it comes to education policy. It has been my privilege to attend many openings of projects around my community and I have yet to attend one where the school has said to me they did not want the facility. In fact, quite the opposite is true. Every school community from kindergarten students to teachers and principals to parents and families has welcomed with open arms their new facilities. They have been overjoyed. Only a few weeks ago I attended the official opening of St Bede's primary school's new multipurpose hall and library. It was a fantastic community event and everyone was so proud of their new buildings and what they would mean for their education. At that event I was warmly welcomed by the chair of the school board who said in her speech to the school community: 'This is an extraordinary opportunity for a school such as St Bede's, where only four years ago this community had to raise money to fully fund the installation of air-conditioning in our classrooms and to put shade up for the children to play safely in summer.' She also said the facilities themselves are: 'bright and shiny, functional and spacious. They give our children a place to run and stretch and worship the god of soccer on a rainy day and they give our children an inviting space in which to read, explore and learn more about our world.' Any reasonable person hearing that speech would not conclude that this was a school who thought they had been rorted. These are the words of a school community so proud of and grateful for the facilities and opportunities made possible by the Building the Education Revolution program. I mention the speech not because it is unique but because it is so common: it is representative of the feedback I always get at these events. Our reforms do not stop there. This government is investing $3 billion in the Building Australia's Future Workforce which will deliver 130,000 high-quality training places. We have invested $100 million to mentor apprentices through their training. Currently only 48 per MAIN COMMITTEE cent of apprentices complete their first year of training. This funding will help stem this loss of skills. The government is also providing $281 million to provide tax-free payments to encourage apprentices in their trade. This $1,700 bonus will support some 200,000 apprentices over four years, with over 4,000 of these in my own electorate. These initiatives have seen a 5.4 per cent increase in the number of students entering a trade, an amazing achievement, and, most significantly, an 11 per cent increase in the ACT, which is incredibly welcome given the skills shortage we have here. We have also increased the number of Australians going to university with over one million students enrolled in higher education in 2010, a 5.1 per cent increase. This year we saw more than 480,000 undergraduates, an increase of 10 per cent since 2009. In all, this government has seen a 22 per cent increase in Commonwealth supported students since we came to office. We do these things because the government understands the transformative power of education. This government, like the Labor governments before it, knows that when you provide education to a person you give them more than just a skill; you give them an identity, you give them confidence, you give them self-esteem, you give them opportunity and you give them hope for the future. This is a government that knows that by funding education you invest in a nation's future. You invest in a strong and productive economy and you provide a measure of protection against unemployment and the inflationary effects of skill shortages. This has always been part of the DNA of the Australian Labor Party and I am glad to be able to take my seat in this house at this very exciting time for education. These policies, which have brought so much benefit to this country, so much benefit to my Canberra community, have been opposed at every turn by those opposite, by an opposition who in government watched as the skill shortage came upon us, watched and did nothing. They were a government that stripped funding from universities, which took us to the bottom of the OECD in terms of funding for higher education. They did nothing, despite their massive surpluses, to protect this country from the hard times. They failed to invest in the future. I am glad that this is a government that will not commit the same mistake. We are deeply committed to improving education for all. We are deeply committed to reducing the chronic skill shortages we have in this country, particularly in Canberra. We are deeply committed to ensuring that Australia has the community it needs, the skills and training it needs, for its future prosperity. And that commitment is deeply underscored with our significant, historic investment in education. Leichhardt Electorate: Insurance Industry express a very serious grievance I have relating to the activities of the insurance industry and what they are doing in my electorate. I have some serious concerns that there are companies there that are engaged in a serious gouging effort in ramping up prices after taking over market dominance in the area. I will give you an example. A few years ago we had a new player come into to the strata title market, the unit market, in Far North Queensland, a company by the name of Zurich. They were very active in undercutting other insurance quotes and over a relatively short period of time effectively achieved a significant part of the market. What has happened is that as soon as this market dominance was achieved they MAIN COMMITTEE",322,Grievance Debate
390,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Chief Opposition Whip) (21:37): I rise this evening tostarted ramping up their premiums. They used as an excuse for the ramping up the fact that they had a major exposure in the area and they claimed that exposure put them at greater risk. We have seen insurance premiums on body corporate buildings in the Far North Queensland region increasing as much as 800 per cent. In the inner-city area of Cairns, we have quite a large number of very modest oneand two-bedroom apartments. Many of them are owned by owner occupiers. A lot of people on fixed incomes-independent retirees and a lot of single individuals on fixed incomes-of $35,000 or $40,000 a year have been living quite comfortably. Suddenly the body corporate insurance has started to ratchet up. We now have a situation where body corporate insurance has got to a level where the body corporate fees makes those units almost impossible to sell. Unfortunately, because these people are on a fixed income, they cannot afford to pay for these additional body corporate fees and so we have a situation where they cannot sell their unit and they cannot afford to pay the fees, so they are actually borrowing money to pay for their body corporate fees. This is totally and absolutely unsustainable. As Zurich has increased its interests, if you like, in the area we have seen many of the other insurers disappear. Suncorp-Metway Insurance has withdrawn from the residential body corporate insurance market. Ace Insurance Co. has also withdrawn, and it has withdrawn nationally, from the body corporate insurance market. As I say, Zurich Australia has increased its body corporate rates, initially by 25 per cent in September 2009 and another 35 per cent in March 2010. It then withdrew all policy discounts and then increased its rates again by 35 per cent in September 2010. It will not underwrite any business with sum insured or asset values over $20 million. They certainly have taken over a very significant part of the market. The Allianz Australia insurance company no longer underwrites risk in Far North Queensland for a value over $6 million. QBE Insurance is reluctant to provide even quotations in the area. AMP insurance will not underwrite any risks over $5 billion, and CGU Insurance Pty Ltd, strata title underwriters, have applied what they call named cyclone excesses. If a cyclone is named, the excess goes through the roof-it makes it not practical to even insure. Of course RACQ Insurance will only provide quotations for non-holiday complexes to a maximum value of $5 million. This has had a profound impact in our region. Acme agents have told me only today that Lumley Insurance has now made a decision that it will be no longer providing insurance in postcodes north of 4373, which means that from Rockhampton north you will not be able to get any insurance from this company. I have examples where insurance premiums in 2008 were $11,000, in 2009 they were $12,000,in 2010 they were $23,000 and the recent one that has just arrived from Zurich is $92,500. This is totally and absolutely unsustainable. I have contacted the Insurance Council of Australia to raise concerns. They claim it is all because it is a cyclone area. When units started to be built in Far North Queensland it was a cyclone area. When insurance companies started insuring all those years ago it was a cyclone area. There has not been a major cyclone that has actually hit these major areas of Cairns and Port Douglas and places like that. There has not been any devastation there. To use that as a justification is an absolute nonsense. I will show you the stupidity of the whole situation. I have a timber house in the region insured for $476,000, and the insurance premium on that is $1,778-that is the current one. There is a duplex valued at $347,000, and the insurance premium on that is $1,647. For a block of strata title one-bedroom units, average size 47 MAIN COMMITTEE square metres, currently selling for $110,000, the average price is $1,400, for an overall cost of $35,900. These are buildings that have been built to cyclone-proof specifications. We have the added problem up there that we have to pay-and have had to pay for many years-the cost of building to cyclone-proof specifications. These buildings are much, much stronger than anything you are likely to see in the southern states, but they are using the cyclone area to ramp up these prices. They are using exposure because of market dominance as an excuse to increase prices to levels where they are totally unaffordable. People up there are saying, 'If we've got to pay $95½ thousand to insure we should be looking at selfinsuring.' Unfortunately, they are over a barrel because they cannot take third-party insurance. The insurance companies are saying, 'We won't give you third-party insurance unless you take our premiums.' There needs to be some sort of common sense brought to this situation. Mum and dad investors from all over Australia have invested in very modest strata title units in our region and they have no hope of selling them. The first six to eight months of their rental goes to covering the insurance premiums alone. Again, it creates an impossible situation for an area that is already struggling. I believe this is something that needs to be referred to the ACCC. We need to investigate these companies that have market dominance. We have to question those companies that have decided to exit this market and go for high-yield investments in superannuation without spreading some of the risk. I am calling on these insurance companies to consider the implications of what they are doing. I will be referring this to the ACCC in an effort to get some sort of understanding. I have spoken to the Insurance Council of Australia about this, but the representatives I spoke to offered no solution at all and basically said, 'You're in a cyclone area.' I said: 'Wait a minute. Since strata title units have existed in Far North Queensland you have had no problem insuring them in the past. There have been no major events where there has been significant damage to strata title units. These buildings pose no greater risk than anything else up there.' It is an absolutely shocking situation. (Time expired) Workplace Relations Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (21:48): I rise today to talk about a matter of importance to my electorate, workplace fairness. Fairness in the workplace is a core value of the Labor Party. This Labor government believe strongly in ensuring that all Australians have the right to the benefits of work, but we also believe that people should be paid fairly for this work and that they should have entitlements such as lunch breaks and tea breaks. In 2007 Labor was elected with a mandate from the Australian people to abolish the previous Liberal government's industrial relations policies, which were hurting workers not only in my electorate but right around Australia. I am proud to say that we kept that promise and dismantled the grossly unfair industrial relations system that took away the basic safety net that had existed for almost a century. You would have thought that the Liberal Party would take a clear message from the Australian people at that election, but it seems they have not listened. Instead, Tony Abbott is committed to continuing to pursue radical industrial relations policies that Australian workers have already rejected. Over the past few weeks we have seen the Leader of the Opposition starting to signal that he wants a return to Work Choices. He sent out his shadow minister for employment and MAIN COMMITTEE workplace relations and got him to call for a renewed debate on workplace reform, a move that has received support from Liberal members of this parliament. We have the shadow Treasurer touting the importance of increased flexibility for workers and for employers. We all know what that means-flexibility for employers. And we have seen the Leader of the Opposition reminiscing about Work Choices and condemning the Labor government for its workplace reforms that have taken, as he said, 'the pendulum from one side and swung it right back to the other side.' With the leader of the coalition preaching about greater freedom for employers and Liberal Party members like the member for Mayo talking about increased workplace flexibility, I think it is important that we establish exactly what the coalition mean when they talk about flexibility. They mean a return to Work Choices, perhaps under another name. The Leader of the Opposition made a promise to the Australian people that Work Choices was 'dead, buried and cremated' and now we have front-row seats as he tries to weasel his way out of this promise and resurrect an industrial relations framework that left ordinary Australians unprotected and ultimately worse off. Let us be clear about what the Howard government's Work Choices policy meant for ordinary hard working Australian families. Work Choices meant less money for Australian workers and it meant increased pressures on household budgets for Australian families. The Australian workplace agreements that were at the crux of Howard government workplace reforms stripped away basic conditions and dramatically reduced job security. Workers lost penalty rates for weekend work, shiftwork and overtime and they lost the right to protection from unfair dismissal. Under Work Choices, studies have shown that casual and part-time sales assistants lost an average 12 per cent of earnings. We also now know that Work Choices was especially bad for women workers. Female workers on AWAs took home on average $87.40 per week less than male workers. The statistics speak for themselves when it comes to the impact of Work Choices: 64 per cent of AWAs cut annual leave loading, 63 per cent cut penalty rates, 52 per cent cut shiftwork loadings, 51 per cent cut overtime loadings, 46 per cent cut public holiday pay, 40 per cent cut rest breaks, 36 per cent cut declared public holidays and 22 per cent provided workers with no pay increase, some for up to five years. As someone who was personally affected by the former Liberal government's first wave of individual contracts, I know too well the impact of these regressive policies on some of our most vulnerable workers. As a young, 19-year-old employee of a large retail company I was presented with a 'take-it-or-leave-it' AWA. When I decided I did not want to sign this individual contract and tried to negotiate it to what the ad had said, the company indicated that I did not have to sign, but I would not receive a wage increase until it was signed. As a result, I was faced with an ultimatum that, either way, meant an erosion of my working conditions. I am proud to be part of a Labor government that abolished Work Choices and replaced it with a new industrial relations system that returns fairness to Australian workplaces. It was this Labor government that brought an end to the AWA individual contracts that stripped away the pay and conditions of Australian workers. It was this Labor government that established Fair Work Australia as the independent umpire to help employees and employers resolve workplace disputes. And it was this Labor government that provided a fair minimum MAIN COMMITTEE safety net for Australian employees comprising 10 national employment standards and a modern award system. We introduced the new no-disadvantage test to make sure collective workplace agreements left workers better off. This side of the House restored protection from unfair dismissal to 2.8 million Australians and now seven million employees are eligible for unfair dismissal compared with just 4.2 million under Work Choices. This Labor government's strong record on workplace relations demonstrates our commitment to ensuring all Australians have the opportunity to benefit from fair employment. This is a record that stands in stark contrast to that of the coalition. In a desperate attempt to make a case for a return to Work Choices, the coalition has suggested that this Labor government's industrial relations reforms are to blame for Australia's stalling productivity. We have seen that stalling productivity in this country for over a decade. It is simply not the case that Work Choices was a panacea to improve productivity. In fact we know that after the introduction of Work Choices, rather than an increase in Australia's productivity as one might expect, productivity continued to stall. Addressing our nation's productivity is a challenge that this government is taking very seriously. Unlike those opposite, we believe it is a more complex issue than just cutting wages and conditions. This Labor government has a strong agenda to increase our nation's productivity by reforming our vocational education and training system to equip Australians with the skills they need to get high-skilled, high-wage jobs. We are investing in innovation through a system to help Australians take ideas to market, and we are investing in the infrastructure critical to traditional economic infrastructure such as roads, rail and ports but also investing in infrastructure for the 21st century through high-speed broadband. The opposition continues to underestimate the impact that high-speed broadband will have on this nation's productivity. In fact, I think the Leader of the Opposition called it the 'entertainment revolution'. I have to say that that just shows how out of touch this opposition leader is. It is ICT, the ability to get fast, high-speed broadband, that will significantly revolutionise and improve our productivity. The Leader of the Opposition's great vision for the future of Australia is to join a race to the bottom of low-skilled, low-wage countries. The opposition seems to think that sending Australian workers home with less money in their back pockets and without penalty rates, leave loading and public holiday pay is somehow going to make workers more productive. Unfortunately the Liberal Party cannot come up with new policies that look to the future, but rely on their good old favourite ideological hobby horse that has never really been about productivity. At the same time, we will talk about productivity; we will look at how we can better this country and improve our nation for the future. Unfortunately, recent calls from senior members of the Liberal Party to re-evaluate industrial relations policy and to increase flexibility for employers is really just bringing back the worse aspects of Work Choices. It is a furphy-and I hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that is parliamentary-to say that the new Fair Work Act does not allow for flexibility. Indeed, there is significant flexibility available under the Fair Work Act. Agreement making at an enterprise level is at the heart of this new system. We know that enterprise bargaining, unlike AWAs, does promote flexibility and efficiency. It is through genuine enterprise bargaining that we have seen the kinds of productivity gains that are essential to improving our nation's economic performance. MAIN COMMITTEE The Liberal Party might have an agenda to return to a rebranded Work Choices under the guise of improving productivity, but this will not happen under the Gillard Labor government. I would like to put on record that the Fair Work Australia Act is working well, with continued decreases in industrial disputes, record levels of agreement making and contained wages growth. To be honest, if the opposition does want to throw this act out the window-an act which is working well, that is actually doing a good job in delivering for both employers and employees-then they will have to answer for that.
