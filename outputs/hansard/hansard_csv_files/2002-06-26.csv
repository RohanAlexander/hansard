Wednesday, 26 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4505 Wednesday, 26 June 2002 ----Social Welfare: Emergency Relief Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (9.40 a.m.)-TodayI would like to strongly support a call for additional support for emergency relief. The Banyule Support and Information Centre, which is based in my electorate, has written to the government setting out the increasing demands for emergency relief from parts of our community. This group, commonly known as range of support and referral services from trained volunteers in a wide range of areas-personal and family counselling, Centrelink assistance and, most importantly, food vouchers and budget advice. All of this assistance is provided free. I have been contacted by the President of BANSIC, Elaine Craddock, who is very concerned that, while local demands for emergency relief continue to increase, this has not been matched by an increase in funding for emergency relief. Over the last five years BANSIC has experienced a marked increase in emergency relief requests. However, over the same period emergency relief funding from Family and Community Services has remained the same, ignoring this very real increase in demand from very needy people. to ration its food vouchers to such an extent that it can only give $25 to a family and $15 to a single person. Of course, $25 does not carry a family very far. While BANSIC is the 12th highest in Victoria in terms of the number of people it helps, it is right at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to funding-26th out of a group of 28. It is unfortunate that in my electorate there are a number of people who need the help of organisations such as BANSIC and are in need of emergency relief.

I am pleased to say that, with this new daily Virgin service, wide-bodied jet services will now be available into Coffs Harbour. It shows the great deal of effort that the local council has put into our airport, and it also shows the vision of the former mayor, Mr John Smith, who was a great visionary within our region and a great supporter of the airport. As a result of that vision and the continuing support of the local council, the airport has become a major regional asset and has been able to secure excellent services such as the new daily jet service by Virgin. It also shows the worth of the government’s support for regional aviation and the importance that regional aviation has in the development of our regional areas and our tourism industries. Some great introductory offers will come with this, which I think will create employment and will showcase the many fine tourism assets in the electorate of Cowper, and this service will complement the very fine services currently offered by Hazelton and Qantas in those areas. I would also say that perhaps the member for Sydney could enjoy the use of this service. It has great introductory prices.

So we have great tourism products and we now have an excellent jet service to complement our existing aviation facilities. Certainly I can see that this jet service will help to create employment and to showcase the fact that regional aviation is an important community asset; it is important to create jobs. It is a very fine service indeed and I would like to compliment Virgin on their decision, their confidence in Coffs Harbour and their confidence in the electorate of Cowper. I am most pleased. In fact, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you may wish to avail yourself of this service at some stage. Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (9.46 a.m.)-President George Bush’s long-awaited speech on Israel and Palestine will probably do more harm than good. If he is genuine about wanting peace in the Middle East, he needs to take an even-handed approach and not support Israeli aggression at any cost. His preparedness to dictate to the Palestinians who their leadership should be stands in stark contrast to his unwillingness to lay down any real conditions on the Israeli leadership. There should of course be democratic elections in Palestine, but the results of those elections are for the Palestinians to decide, not George Bush. It is clear that Ariel Sharon will see this speech as a vindication of the aggressive military action that has occurred in Palestinian areas. Ross Dunn, the Herald correspondent, says that the most likely effect of the speech is to: ... give the Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, the international endorsement he has been seeking for a new and stronger military offensive inside the Palestinian areas. Even the Israeli foreign minister, Shimon Peres, is reported to have criticised the speech as doing more harm than good. Highly regarded ABC foreign correspondent Tim Palmer this morning described Mr Peres’s reaction to the speech of President Bush. He said that during the President’s speech Shimon Peres ‘became angry.’ Mr Palmer quotes Mr Peres as saying:",133,Representatives Main Committee

Not only do we have majorWednesday, 26 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4507 He’s making a fatal mistake making the creation of a Palestinian state dependent on a change of leadership. You can’t just brush Yasser Arafat aside with one speech. Mr Palmer said that Mr Peres became so angry that he turned off the television even before President Bush had finished the long-awaited speech and that before Mr Peres left the room, he said: The abyss into which the region will now plunge will be as deep as the expectations of this speech were high. There will be a bloodbath. Most observers seem to agree that this so-called solution is naive at best and will probably extend rather than shorten the armed conflict in the region. Mr Sharon has made it clear over the years that he is not interested in achieving any peace with the Palestinians which would give them autonomy and control over land that includes settlements. What is needed is an international peacekeeping force. Australia should participate in such a force and should indeed lobby the international community to ensure it happens. Conflict in the Middle East will never end as long as the Israeli government is bent on winning a war against the Palestinians rather than making peace with them. And, of course, the same goes for the Palestinian side. My heart goes out to the families of all those on both sides of the conflict who have lost loved ones. I hope that peace will be achieved soon. I just despair that President Bush has squandered such a valuable opportunity for facilitating that peace. Roads: Tugun Bypass sland and New South Wales that is notorious for its traffic bottlenecks. To fix the bottleneck there is a proposal to construct the Tugun bypass-a road that runs for 6.7 kilometres: 3.4 kilometres in New South Wales and 3.3 kilometres in Queensland. It is a state road and it is the responsibility of the Queensland and New South Wales state governments. There is no doubt that this road is an important part of Gold Coast city infrastructure, and the federal government acknowledges its importance and is prepared to contribute to the project. The Queensland government is the project manager of this venture. The federal government is not. It is the Queensland state government who sets the agenda and the timetable for constructing this very important road. Before the federal government can commit taxpayer dollars to the project, the federal transport minister needs to know what the final cost of the project is going to be. The federal minister has expressed concern at the continuing escalation of cost for the bypass. The initial estimate was $70 million. New estimates are said to be around $280 million, and still climbing. The project sign erected during the last state election campaign, with great fanfare, indicates the approximate cost at $157 million. The Queensland Treasurer, Terry Mackenroth, was reported recently as saying that the Queensland government had committed its share and that the federal government must come up with its share. For a state treasurer to ask for an open cheque is absolutely ludicrous. The federal government has again and again sought full details of the project, and I call on the Queensland state government to provide this information. The Tugun bypass is a divisive issue in the region and is not helped by the inaccurate reporting in our local tabloid, the Gold Coast Bulletin. This paper recently reported that the latest delay with the Tugun bypass was due to the federal government’s changes to the criteria for the environmental impact statement. This is not true. The federal legislation changed, but there was a two-year transitional period to meet the new criteria and the Queensland state government still could not meet the deadline. The delays are attributable to the state governments but, true to form, the Gold Coast Bulletin chose not to report the issue correctly.",134,Representatives Main Committee

I want to assure the constituents of McPherson that the federal government is strongly committed to the project. Through the working party established with the Queensland Minister for Transport, I hope that we see a cost for the project put on the table, that we see a final route for the bypass and the environmental impact statement completed to comply with federal government legislation. Nobody wants any more delays on this bypass. I call on the Queensland government, as project manager, to progress this matter as efficiently as possible and to strongly lobby the New South Wales government to come on board and accept their responsibility for part of that road. General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme that the Howard government’s General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, entitlements in the event of the company they worked for going broke. However, GEERS is turning away legitimate claimants and, as a result, causing more heartache and suffering. My constituents Arthur ‘Jim’ Pank, formerly of Forestdale, Edwin Gooderham of Durack and Lindsay Hartigan, also from Durack, have had to deal with not only losing their jobs but with finding out that their entitlements are gone and then making a claim to GEERS-only to have it coldly rejected by an uncaring and mean-spirited government. Jim, Lindsay and Edwin all lost their jobs with a company called Raycash Pty Ltd. They are owed about $60,000 in entitlements, and they are not alone. Many more people lost their jobs the day Raycash went bust. The liquidators of Raycash advised me that they will only be able to pay back a few thousand dollars of entitlements owed from the company’s assets. This is where GEERS should have stepped in, but GEERS has knocked back their claim and their appeal, despite legal advice from Raycash’s liquidators stating that their claim is valid and that GEERS is liable to pay. tlements. On top of this, revelations in Senate estimates committee hearings show that the government has managed to process only 54 per cent of claims within four months of receiving them-its target is 80 per cent-and that, due to caps on the scheme, workers have missed out on $9.4 million of their legal entitlements. The budget for the scheme has also blown out by $20 million. As a result, workers are missing out on entitlements while the cost to the taxpayer is also blowing out. People like Lindsay, Edwin and Jim are suffering. They are owed thousands of dollars and they are all nearing retirement. Effectively, their retirement funds have been stolen and the government will not lift a finger to help them. For the past two years Labor has proposed a national insurance scheme to cover 100 per cent of workers entitlements. This scheme would make large businesses contribute to an insurance fund, which would then ensure that 100 per cent of workers entitlements were covered in the event of insolvency. The federal government would make payments on behalf of smaller business. Labor estimates that its scheme would cost businesses with more than 20 employees only about 0.1 per cent of payroll. The Howard government should be standing up for people like Lindsay and Edwin and Jim, just as it did for National Textiles workers and Ansett workers. It should admit that its taxpayer-funded safety net scheme is a costly failure and it should put in place a national employment entitlements insurance scheme that will guarantee no less than 100 per cent of all workers entitlements.

State and Local Government: Funding Arrangements quiry into the way local government is funded. I am on the record as saying that maybe it is time for alternative methods of administering federal funds. We seem to get better results and value for money by dealing directly with the people through local government. In my electorate, all three councils-Shoalhaven, Kiama and Wingecarribee-welcomed this inquiry and look forward to the results being both published and actioned. They announced this sentiment at a recent opportunity that they each had to present their visions to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and, at the time, the Acting Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson. Part of the reason that councils welcome this inquiry is that once and for all it will demonstrate what they believe has been happening for some time in New South Wales-that is, the erosion of councils’ available funds through increased responsibilities being passed on to them by state governments that do not provide added ongoing funding to perform those extra functions. As an example, just yesterday one council rang me to say they had been required by the New South Wales state government to inspect and report on all properties in terms of bush fire risk. This has been performed on an ad hoc basis in the past as properties with special risks or requirements have come to councils’ notice through the DA process. Now the procedure is mandatory for every property, with full reporting to the state government required within a fairly tight time frame. In my electorate of Gilmore, one of the most fire-prone areas in the world, there are approximately 62,000 properties. What funding, you ask, has come from the New South Wales state government with this new requirement? Absolutely none. Somehow, out of their already fully committed budgets, our councils have to find the resources to employ suitably qualified officers to go out to inspect and report on every single property. And where do you think the money will come from? Will it come from road maintenance? Will it come from playground equipment? Maybe it will come from the waste management section. I know: let us take it out of the assistance they give to volunteer rural fire brigades, shall we? I think not. This federal government has, against all Labor’s best efforts, brought in a new tax system. All that GST-which is a growth fund, meaning that the funds generated will increase every year-all that extra money, is being paid directly to the state governments. Where is that money going? How can they take increased funding every year and not pass at least some of it on to our local councils? The New South Wales government certainly is quick enough to flick-pass extra work and blame on to local government. I think it is about time it passed on the money as well. This inquiry cannot come soon enough, and I too look forward to seeing the results. I conclude by saying that my experience in dealing with the state government has been less than productive and has been very bureaucratic. Just look at what happened with the construction of Main Road 92: the state government is dragging its heels, while Shoalhaven City Council has gotten off its backside, sunk its own money into this investment and got going on",136,Representatives Main Committee

This inquiry is long overdue, and I believe that significant changes will flow as a result of the findings. members’ statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 March, on motion by Mr Williams: That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment (Child Protection Convention) Bill 2002. However, we will be moving a second reading amendment, which I will come to later in my speech. I think it is fair to say that matters relating to parental responsibility, the care of children and access to children are probably some of the most distressing matters that members of parliament have to deal with in their electoral offices. They can be incredibly frustrating where there are conflict of jurisdiction issues, particularly where a child resides overseas or is taken overseas. In that context, the opposition fully support this bill, which amends the Family Law Act 1975 to implement the Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children 1996. On Monday, 24 June the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommended that Australia ratify this convention. I commend the treaties committee for the solid work that it has done on this bill and, indeed, generally. The convention and the bill aim to provide clear rules to resolve jurisdictional conflicts between courts of different countries in proceedings involving children. The rules will cover four main issues: firstly, whether a court has jurisdiction to hear an international parental responsibility dispute; secondly, which country’s law is to be applied in determining international parental responsibility disputes; thirdly, what conditions must be satisfied to ensure international recognition and enforcement of parenting orders; and, finally, what obligations courts in Australia and overseas have to cooperate in the protection of children. They are the essential elements of the more detailed provisions. In March this year, the opposition referred the bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee to report on whether it properly implements Australia’s obligations under the convention. The committee reported in May, concluding that the bill does so and recommending unanimously that the bill be supported. As I noted earlier, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has also essentially come to the same conclusion. Concerns were raised in submissions to the Senate committee from several organisations, including the Legal Aid Directors Secretariat and the National Council of Single Mothers and their Children. They raised a number of issues. Those issues included, for instance, a conflict between the child protection convention and the child abduction convention as they saw it, the lack of a definition of ‘habitual residence’ in the bill, the rights of non-married fathers, the enforcement in Australia of decisions by foreign courts, and the extension of the jurisdiction of the Family Court to other convention countries. We believe that the arguments presented and the concerns raised by those organisations were addressed in the committee’s report and the opposition is satisfied that the concerns, in so far as they are yet to be attended to, do not justify delaying the passage of this bill. The committee noted that the limited number of concerns raised during its inquiry was probably a consequence of the fact that the bill resulted from a long process of consultation. Following the making of the convention, a Commonwealth-state working group was estab-",137,Representatives Main Committee

367,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (9.58 A.m.),"The opposition fully support the Family LawWednesday, 26 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4511 lished in 1997. It published two issues papers on the implications of ratification for Commonwealth, state and territory legislation. The working group reported in 1999 and proposed amendments to Commonwealth, state and territory laws. I note that the Queensland government expressed concern to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties that the Commonwealth is seeking the passage of this bill before the states and territories have finalised their legislation. The Queensland government’s submission stated: Taking binding treaty action prior to the necessary implementing legislation for States and Territories being in place is likely to cause considerable legal and administrative difficulties. It would constrain the effective implementation of the Convention in Australia. In light of this concern, the joint standing committee has encouraged close consultation between the Attorney-General’s Department and states and territories in relation to the model state and territory legislation currently under preparation to ensure that all Australian legislation is harmonised and to ensure effective implementation of the convention. We also endorse that call by the treaties committee but, again, we think the legislation is of such importance that there should be no delay in its passage through this House. We urge the Attorney-General to apply himself to consulting with the states and territories as the committee has recommended, and we have no doubt that he will do so. In summary, the bill will provide greater certainty in international disputes involving children, and the opposition fully supports its measures. The passage of the bill is an appropriate occasion, we believe, to note that there are also a range of other pressing matters relating to the care and nurture of children generally, including children in Australia and Australian children overseas. On that basis, we therefore propose a second reading amendment, which I have foreshadowed. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not denying the bill a second reading, this House: (1) notes the underpinning principle of the Bill is to ensure that the best interests of children are protected; (2) strongly endorses this principle which should apply to all matters relating to the care and nurture of children throughout Australia; (3) calls upon the Government to respond to the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties relating to steps necessary to implement the Convention on the Rights of the Child; and (4) notes that Labor’s proposal for a Children’s Commissioner would further the best interests and protection of children nationally”. The member for Gellibrand, the shadow minister for youth and children, will say a little more about those matters in her contribution. Turning to the third paragraph of the motion, having commended the work of the treaties committee generally, I fully acknowledge it was an initiative of this government, although arising from a recommendation made under the previous government from the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. The treaties committee, I believe, has been a great initiative in terms of inviting submissions from the public on significant treaty action before it is ratified. In so doing, I think it has been a mechanism for establishing to the Australian community that we very much benefit from being part of an international community, and that a lot can be done through international cooperative means such as this to make life easier for citizens of all countries-and, in this important area, to protect children. Returning to paragraph (3) of our second reading motion, I think it was in October 1998 that the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties reported in respect of the convention concern4512 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 2002 ing the rights of children. I was a member of the committee at that time. It was an excellent report and it came about as a result of tremendously hard work undertaken by the secretariat. I draw the government’s attention to a number of recommendations made in that report. We really should be looking at measures we can take to further a number of those very significant recommendations. Having said that, I will conclude my remarks and let others contribute to the debate. Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (10.09 a.m.)-I second the amendment, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would like to acknowledge the comments made by the member for Barton, who has the carriage of this matter for the opposition. He set out our full support for the terms of the Family Law Amendment (Child Protection Convention) Bill 2002. He outlined in some detail what the bill sets out to achieve. Any member of the House who has gone through this bill in detail will have noted that it is an incredibly technical bill. The main purpose, for anyone who is trying to read it, would be a little hard to uncover. But it does highlight in this area how complex the laws and regulations between countries, let alone between states, can be. We do sometimes lose sight of the fact that, as governments, we should be trying to make sure that the best interests of children are put first when determining how we handle these matters. The bill seeks to do that, and that is the reason why Labor supports the initiatives. We do note that the bill has an international focus in that it deals with jurisdictional difficulties between countries, but the point needs to be made that we have a number of very serious jurisdictional problems within our own country by virtue of having a federal system. I think lots more work can be done in this area. The purpose of our second reading amendment is to highlight not our lack of support for the bill but where we think the principles that underlie this bill can be taken and developed further in the interests of Australian children. Anyone who has spoken with children’s welfare workers or has worked in the Family Court, the Children’s Court or in the area of domestic violence-as has the member for Sydney, who will also be speaking in this debate-will know that our legal system, try as it might, sometimes does cause great difficulties for those interested in the protection of children. We have an obligation at a national level to make sure that we do what we can to make that system work better. It does require an enormous amount of hard work and lots of cooperation between states and the Commonwealth, which often is very difficult to obtain, but I think it is something that on both sides of the House we need to push a little harder for. The type of detailed work that went into the committee review and the preparation of this bill is obviously a sign that it can be done. However, there does need to be a bit of will for us to do that. The second reading amendment also endorses the principle that we should highlight the importance of caring for and nurturing children throughout Australia and Australian children throughout the rest of the world. Again, this builds on the notion that we actually need to better value our children. There is a changing understanding of the nature of childhood. I think we have moved past the idea that children should be seen and not heard, that they should quietly do what they are told at all times and, if we want to go back, that they should go and work in the coal mines-and, to go further back than that, that children themselves should be having children when they are 11 or 12. Our views in a Western democracy about what childhood means have changed as we have learned more about how children develop, about the importance of brain development in the very early years of a child’s life, about the importance of children being kept safe and healthy and about how that has an effect on their life course in the future. We have acknowledged more and more that children are actually young people and",138,Representatives Main Committee
368,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley),"Is the amendment seconded?Wednesday, 26 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4513 that children are not there to be treated as possessions and bossed around. I think that parents are the ones who best understand this and that sometimes governments and other organisations have been slower to pick this up. Talking about the interests of and the valuing of children has created a little misunderstanding and fear that somehow this is something that has to run counter to the interests of parents. There is a very strong sense of this in some sections of the community, and it has come about because we need to have a better debate about valuing children. Valuing children means valuing children in families and valuing the role that parents have in the development of their children. We need to be able to provide the support that parents need to give their children the best start in life as well. This is why the second reading amendment also deals with the recommendations made by the joint standing committee that the member for Barton referred to. The report of that committee dealt with a whole range of things that would make a great difference to children’s lives in this country, and it is disappointing that there has been no formal response at all from the government on this, despite the cross-party and crossHouse work that has been done and the comprehensive way the report dealt with a whole range of issues affecting children in Australia. We urge that attention be given to this. I do note that the government has established the position of Minister for Children and Youth Affairs-an initiative that we have supported. We think that is an important step, and we have done the same thing in having a shadow minister for children and youth-in this instance, me-to make a statement about the importance of children and young people deserving to have their interests looked after by a spokesperson in this place. But there is no point in having the title if we cannot do more with it. We want to see the minister take a little more action in this area and take very seriously his role in trying to further the interests and well-being of children across the country. It is for this reason that the last point of our second reading amendment refers to our proposal to establish a children’s commissioner, which we believe would further the best interests and protection of children nationally. I would like to take a little time to detail what we think a children’s commissioner would do and why we are urging the government to consider this as an initiative worthy of taking up. It really goes to the issues and the underlying principles I have already spoken about in this bill. We must acknowledge that there needs to be some sort of national voice for children. We must acknowledge that they are in a different position from that of most other members of this community. They are not free to vote, often they are not free to speak out as readily as other members of the public are and often they are not in the position to do that even if they are given the means. We need to recognise that there should be an organisation, a body or a person that is able to consider the best interests of children and advocate to both government and the public what the children’s interests are and what might be in their best interests. They would play a role as an independent statutory office, which is what we are proposing for a national commissioner for children and young people. They would play a role which was entirely independent of government. As other commissioners have done in the past, I am sure they would be able to put a lot of pressure on governments of all colours. This is not a suggestion that we think would be appropriate just when there is a Liberal government; we think that a Labor government would benefit from the expertise and advocacy of a commissioner for children and young people-a commissioner who would have a specific interest in, and would lobby government and inform the public on, areas that may not otherwise be taken up by government. I think a commissioner for children and young people could play a very important role in valuing children as people and as part of our society. I have been increasingly disturbed to 4514 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 2002 hear, in the small amount of debate that there has been on the Intergenerational Report, which was part of the budget, about the dropping number of children. It seems that the only discussion that we have had from the government on this is that we are going to have fewer taxpayers to pay for us in our old age, rather than actually talking about how we are going to make sure that those children have the most opportunities in life, a chance to be able to develop and meet their full potential and to be able to be valued as children while they are children and not just seen as future taxpayers for the rest of us. A very important reason that we have put forward this proposal for a commissioner for children and young people is that we believe there is a role to be played nationally in the protection of our children. I do not think anyone in this House can ignore the absolute scourge in our community of child abuse and child sexual abuse. This is a devastating problem across the country. It is not just in the churches or Aboriginal communities; it can be in all families. It can involve people with different economic means and people in different parts of the world-in urban areas like mine and in regional areas like that of the Deputy Speaker, Mr Causley. This is a very serious issue. I am sure that other speakers will mention this, but there really are no words to describe how terrible, how tragic, how violent and how awful are some of the examples that are presented to us day in and day out of the abuse of children, sometimes as young as three and four, and of the emotional and physical trauma, let alone the long term physical and emotional damage, caused to these children. I know I cannot describe it adequately in this House, but I do think it is important to try to describe some of it, because one of the problems that we face in dealing with child abuse and child sexual abuse is that noone wants to talk about it-it is an embarrassing and uncomfortable thing for people to deal with. Unfortunately, in the argument over the Governor General’s handling in his previous life of a child abuse matter, we basically saw that, at the national level, our Prime Minister and our Governor-Generalshould be aware of standing order 74. a national level we lack an ability to articulate the extent of this problem and the methods for us to be able to deal with it. We think that the establishment of a commissioner for children and young people is a way for us to have an independent office that is able to speak out on some of these issues, and it would have the resources and the position within the community to do that without fear or favour, without political interest needing to motivate action. That is an important role and something we must be prepared to take on. This is an area where the states have an important role to play-I do not deny that. There is a massive social problem in Australia. I do not want to overstate it, but the bigger risk is that we understate it and fail to deal with it. Having an independent statutory office at a national level which is expert in this area and which is focused on these issues is one way of trying to move the debate forward. In our proposal, which was launched by our leader, Simon Crean, and me in May, we have set out some steps that we would like to explore and consult further with the community on. We invited feedback from the federal departments and from the minister, but we have yet to receive any response. One of the issues that we have identified is our proposal to introduce a national ‘working with children check’. This builds on the work that has already been done in Queensland and New South Wales by the children’s commissioners in both those states. It involves a check on a person who is working with children to ensure that they do not have a criminal record in a relevant area and that they are clear of any violent or sexual offences against children. In New South Wales they go a step further and do past employment checks",140,Representatives Main Committee

The point that I am trying to make is that atWednesday, 26 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4515 and checks for family violence orders that might be relevant and not only is there a check, but a legislative prohibition makes it illegal for someone who is disqualified to work with children. In Queensland it is an administrative process. A clearance is done and a card is presented to a person to say, ‘Yes, you are eligible to work with children,’ or to be the scoutmaster or to run a school boarding house or the cubs group or whatever other thing it might be. We are consulting very widely on this issue because it would be a big change, but we think it would be a very practical way of taking some steps at a national level which would help ensure that the adults who are working with our children are appropriate. Parents must be able to be confident to leave their children at child-care centres and at schools, to go on sports camps and to do other things. It is vital for children’s healthy development and well-being to be able to get out and about and experience a wide range of things. None of us underestimates how important it is for children to be exposed to a range of experiences and for them to have with a range of adults relationships that are healthy and positive, but we should undertake a check so that those people who are deemed inappropriate to be caring for and working with children are not able to do so. That would be a great step forward for us. We have also said that we would like to consult with the community about introducing terms in contracts for those organisations that receive federal funding to ensure that they have protocols in place for the prevention of child abuse and, in the event that child abuse does occur, for the handling of complaints. The many organisations that have the benefit of public funding should take steps to be able to protect our children in the future. Also in this area, and something even more directly related to this bill rather than our second reading amendment, are some of the jurisdictional problems between the states and the Commonwealth-I mentioned them briefly before-but especially in the overlap between child protection matters and Family Court matters. I know that the Family Court and the Attorney-General’s Department have already been doing some work. I suspect it is one of those works of art, an issue for all governments. But we need to draw a line in the sand somewhere and say, ‘This is a problem that we need to deal with quickly.’ We cannot just let it go on forever. I know the Family Court has done some really good work in looking at how these orders in different systems can often work against each other, where child protection workers can be saying that it is not safe to leave children in a certain environment and the Family Court can be making orders granting custody to that parent. These are difficult issues, but they are ones that need to be dealt with. We think that there would be an opportunity. We do not necessarily need to wait for there to be a commissioner for children and young people to be established to deal with some of these things. They are issues that should be dealt with, where the Commonwealth has a clear responsibility. We have also said that we would like some consultations on whether it is possible to have a national approach to the definitions of ‘child abuse’ and ‘neglect’, to mandatory reporting requirements and to other reporting matters. These are issues that are often raised. They would not be new to the government. They are incredibly complex. I do not raise them as issues that I think there is any simple answer to; but a commissioner for children and young people would potentially be able to play a role in furthering some of this debate. Child abuse is only one issue, though it is a very important issue and has a great impact on those that are affected by it: there are many other issues that children and young people are interested in and that their parents are interested in that we think a national commissioner for children and young people could deal with. I refer to issues such as children’s health, changing health patterns and how we need to take some steps to make sure that we are going to bring up children who will be healthy in the future. We have no national children’s services 4516 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 2002 agenda. We have a very hotchpotch system between local government, the states and the Commonwealth for the provision of our preschool services. I do not mean preschool as it is called in some states where it relates to four-year-olds for the year before they go to school; I mean services provided to those children under five or six before they are at school. It includes child care, maternal and child health issues, preschool and kindergarten services, playgroups and a whole range of other things. Now that we are learning much more about early childhood development and the absolutely central importance of those first couple of years in a child’s life and the impact they can have on their life as an adult, we must look at investing more in these years and we must make sure that the community understands their importance. We think that a national commissioner for children and young people could do that. We think that they could help provide a voice for young people, for young adults, who do not have an effective conduit to government any more. At the national level there is no funded youth peak organisation. There is only the Youth Roundtable, and that does not play a role of providing ongoing advice to government or to the public. We think it is incredibly important that some method for governments to communicate with young people be re-established. That is one of the things that we also would like to consult on further. In summary, this bill is an important one. It is one that we support. We think it indicates that there are people within the government and on both sides of the House who are interested in the protection of children. But we need to take it a step further. We need to remember that we cannot just do that internationally; we need to do it locally. There are many steps that we can take and provide leadership for at the national level. If we are really interested in advocating for the health and well-being of our children and young people, we must do it at a national level and we must not turn a blind eye to some of the really difficult problems that are occurring in this area. I commend the bill to the House and commend the second reading amendment. We would be delighted if the government would consider taking up some of these proposals and we have already offered bipartisan support on the small initiatives that the government have taken in this area, particularly in the area of children’s health and well-being. Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (10.27 a.m.)-As the member for Gellibrand said, the Family Law Amendment (Child Protection Convention) Bill 2002 is a very important bill and one that the Labor Party supports. When I saw the speakers list this morning, I was very surprised to notice that there are no members of the government speaking on this very important legislation. I know that often legislation is relegated to the Main Committee when it is considered uncontroversial, but surely uncontroversial does not mean unimportant. In a case like this, where we are talking about the best interests of children, I am very surprised that a government that continues to say that the nuclear family is the most important unit of society does not see the importance of having at least one or two speakers on the speakers list for this important legislation. The second reading amendment that has been moved by the member for Barton draws attention to some of the more important aspects of this legislation. We certainly will not be opposing the legislation, as the member for Barton and the member for Gellibrand have stated, but the amendment does draw attention to the fact that the underpinning principle of this bill must be to ensure that the best interests of children are protected and that this principle should apply to all matters relating to the care and nurture of children throughout Australia. There have been any number of international conventions relating to the care and protection of children, particularly in relation to maintenance being paid to people who reside in Wednesday, 26 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4517 Australia where one parent lives overseas and the child resides in Australia. We have agreements with countries overseas to collect maintenance payments from people who have children residing in Australia when that parent lives overseas. This is an area that is fraught with difficulty, because we know that one of the reasons that some parents move overseas is specifically to avoid their child maintenance obligations. It is disappointing that, despite the fact that we have conventions relating to maintenance, parents are often frustrated in trying to collect money owed to them by non-custodial parents living overseas. The only people who really suffer in this ongoing battle inevitably are the children who are not receiving proper maintenance from their non-custodial parents. The convention on child protection covers the attribution, exercise, termination or restriction of parental responsibility, rights of custody and access, guardianship and curatorship, the designation of functions of any person or body having charge of the child’s personal property, the placement of the child in foster care, institutional care or any similar arrangement, the supervision by a public authority of the care of a child by any person having charge of the child, and the administration, conservation or disposal of the child’s property. The preamble to the convention specifically excludes a number of areas, including the establishment or contesting of a parent-child relationship, decisions on adoption, the names of the child, emancipation, maintenance obligations, trusts or succession, social security, public measures of education or health, penal offences committed by children, and decisions on the rights of asylum and immigration. I understand that maintenance obligations are specifically excluded because of the enormous amount of bureaucratic support needed to pursue maintenance obligations in an international context in this way. It is still frustrating, however, that I have any number of constituents who tell me that after years and years of working with the Australian Child Support Agency and establishing the whereabouts and even the bank account details of non-custodial parents living overseas, they are still unable to claim support from the non-custodial parents. I have one particular case that I have been working on since 1998. Without mentioning the name of anyone involved, it is a constituent of mine who lives in Balmain with her daughter. With respect to her circumstances, the case was registered for collection as a stage 2 case from 1997. The Child Support Agency collected only one payment on this lady’s behalf of less than $1,200 through a tax refund intercept. That occurred in 1998. In 1999, the Child Support Agency determined that the non-custodial parent had ceased to be a resident of Australia for the purposes of the Income Tax Assessment Act and the case was ended retrospectively, with about $13,000 of accumulated debt. That debt was obviated when the case was ended retrospectively. The non-custodial parent went to live in Ireland and the custodial parent obtained an overseas maintenance order requiring the non-custodial parent to pay child support of $250 a week. The order was registered for CSA collection in January 2000 and the liability was backdated to November 1999. In accordance with the procedure, the CSA overseas team, which is based in Hobart, arranged for the Australian Government Solicitor to register the order with the child support collection agency in Ireland. That was properly done and details of the non-custodial parent’s address, bank account and employment details in Ireland were passed on to the Irish authorities. To date, no payments have been transferred to the CSA. At the time of this advice from the minister, the non-custodial parent owed about $14,000. So the non-custodial parent had a $13,000 debt wiped, and has since accumulated another debt of at least $14,000. This was some time ago, so I presume the debt is substantially higher now. So, despite the fact that we have these international agreements with other countries, there is a vast degree of frustration 4518 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 2002 on the part of custodial parents in Australia in trying to collect child support from noncustodial parents living overseas. While this bill does not cover that situation, I think it is an area that the Australian authorities will have to work a lot harder on with our overseas colleagues. I had another case where a custodial parent separated from her husband in 1993. The support issues dragged on for about six years. In 1998 she received only $5,000 in a lump sum as support for their child. The non-custodial parent left Australia for the Czech Republic. We have a reciprocal agreement with the Czech Republic to recover child support payments from non-custodial parents who go to the Czech Republic, yet no money has been recovered from this non-custodial parent. The custodial parent in this case had specifically asked the Child Support Agency to anticipate that the non-custodial parent was likely to leave the country and to make arrangements to prevent him leaving until he had made arrangements to ensure that he would pay maintenance. The Australian legislation allows for her to tell the Child Support Agency that her estranged husband was likely to leave the country. The Child Support Agency did not take any action and the custodial parent was told, only after repeated phone calls to the agency, that they had given up on her case due to underresourcing and were unable to collect any moneys owing to her. This custodial parent had done the right thing: she had notified the Child Support Agency of changes in circumstance-and in fact had pre-empted those changes-by warning the agency that the non-custodial parent was likely to leave the country-yet they did not see fit to tell the custodial parent that they had given up trying to recover money. They left it for her to find out herself after many frustrating phone calls. The sorts of child custody and maintenance cases that come in to electorate offices are some of the most heart breaking. Everyone recognises that the ongoing conflict that children witness and the emotional strain placed on parents by this conflict are undoubtedly detrimental to children. In most cases, no matter what the outcome is, the suffering is quite extreme for many children-and no more so than in cases of child abduction. I noted the concerns of the National Council for Single Mothers and Their Children. They had a number of concerns about how this convention would fit in with the child abduction convention. I think that the child abduction convention was something that anyone working in the area of child protection was very keen to see passed. While I do not advocate the abduction of children and never would, the sad reality is that in many cases there are parents who, believing quite sincerely that their children are in danger of physical, sexual or emotional abuse, may abduct these children. The National Council of Single Mothers and Their Children was pointing out that in some countries overseas, where there is a presumption that children will stay with the father and that nationals of those countries are given some privileges in cases of deciding custody arrangements, this might be the only option that some women feel is available to them. On further examination of the Family Law Amendment (Child Protection Convention) Bill 2002, while those concerns are perfectly valid and something that the parliament did need to address by looking at the bill more carefully, I think that the interaction between the two conventions is not necessarily a bad one. The child abduction convention deals with the shortterm impact of an abduction, whereas the child protection convention deals with longer-term decisions about where children will eventually live and who will have responsibility for them, and I think that that interaction is quite a proper one. However, even where these conventions are drafted with the best of intentions and are drafted quite thoughtfully, one of the concerns is that Australian citizens face additional problems in taking action under the conventions in Wednesday, 26 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4519 overseas countries. Quite often, legal systems are difficult for us to comprehend and it is difficult to find difficult legal representation overseas. I have another very serious case of child abduction where the abducted child and the noncustodial parent who has abducted her are living in New York. To have access to the New York court system, my constituent is of course expected to pay commercial rates to hire a lawyer in New York. The sort of prices that we are talking about-especially when you factor in the exchange rate-make it almost impossible for my client to afford that legal representation, particularly when you consider airfares to go over to appear in the hearings as well. The delays that are experienced in the New York court system mean that my client has had to travel over to New York a number of times, only to get there and be disappointed. I am sorry to say that I believe that the weight given to Australian documentation and representations from Australian authorities in this case has been minimal. There was an order in place that this child should not be taken out of the country. We have a copy of an Australian Federal Police airport watch notification for this child. The child’s older sister, who remains in Australia, is beside herself at being separated from her sister. While my view is that it is quite clear where the law stands, if a person does not have the money to afford legal representation or, for some other reason, cannot understand the legal system in a country that is very different from ours, then having access to justice in these cases is quite a step further than just having the law on your side, even if it is international law. I would like to conclude by reiterating what the two previous speakers said: that this bill must ensure that the best interests of the child are protected and that all Australian laws and policies should take that as their central principle. In addition to that, we have also moved that the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties should take the necessary steps to implement the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I think this is another important area and, with more time, I would certainly like to canvass that. But a first step, certainly, in treating Australian children properly is to standardise some of the child protection measures between states, as the member for Gellibrand said. A second thing I would add is that keeping young children, including unaccompanied children, in detention centres in a country like Australia makes it very difficult for us to hold up our heads internationally when we are talking about the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Our proposal for a children’s commissioner would allow us to canvass these issues more publicly, not in a partisan way but with an independent person who is charged with being a strong voice for children in Australia. The sorts of issues that I think would be priority issues for a children’s commissioner are those that the member for Gellibrand was talking about in relation to child abuse and child sexual abuse. The number of cases reported to authorities in Australia is truly shocking. Not all of those cases are found to have substance, but if even 10 per cent of the tens of thousands of cases reported to the New South Wales Department of Community Services alone every year are found to be substantiated, we can quite rightly refer to child abuse in this country as an epidemic. I think that governments have begun to realise and have begun to address this issue quite seriously but, because of the enormous numbers of children we are talking about and because child abuse, like domestic violence, has always been considered something to be hidden in the domestic sphere and not talked about publicly, we are really only at the very beginning of the process of addressing child abuse and child sexual abuse. We do have a very long way to go, and I think that programs, such as Families First in New South Wales, that start at the very beginning with community visits to young families when they first bring their babies home from hospital-visits that teach parents to be good parents and to look for support when they 4520 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 2002 are at the end of their tether-are incredibly important in protecting children not just in the first months of their lives by teaching parents to seek help when they need it but throughout their lives. I commend this legislation to the House. I believe it is important to take an international view of child protection, because we know that children are moving around the world much more than they did 50 years ago. These sorts of conventions mean that, as long as a country is a signatory, parents can have some comfort in knowing that, if their children are taken away without permission, they will have some recourse to international law in regaining custody of their children. Ms KING (Ballarat) (10.48 a.m.)-I rise to speak on the Family Law Amendment (Child Protection Convention) Bill 2002. The bill amends the Family Law Act 1975 to allow Australia to proceed with the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The convention is designed to address conflicts in jurisdictions in children’s matters between courts in different countries. The bill implements arrangements to guarantee the recognition and enforcement in Australia of parenting orders for other convention countries, and vice versa. In an era where there are greater numbers of cross-country marriages and where the global movement of people between countries is an everyday occurrence, it is overwhelmingly apparent that the potential for conflict over which country has jurisdiction in deciding parental responsibility when relationships break down must be addressed. The cases in which this conflict does arise are often very public, the disputes are often bitter and drawn out, and there is an enormous lack of clarity as to which country’s laws should apply. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee commented, ‘At present, there are no clear rules and procedures governing such disputes, with the result that Australian courts and overseas courts sometimes make conflicting parenting orders in relation to the same children. Authorities in one country may fail to act because they assume that authorities in another country have responsibility for a child.’ In cases that involve the protection of children, this is clearly unacceptable. The Family Law Amendment (Child Protection Convention) Bill 2002 goes beyond lip-service and changes the Family Law Act 1975 to provide clear jurisdictional rules for courts here and abroad. It continues the work of developing multilateral instruments for the protection of children. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.50 a.m. to 11.05 a.m. sponsibility disputes. Governments cannot change the fact that relationships break down, but they can do all within their power to ensure that the overriding principle in making decisions is what is in the best interests of the child. I cannot begin to imagine how parents must feel when they find themselves caught up in a complex tangle of international law when attempting to resolve parental responsibility disputes. Added to the mix is the potential that those children may need to be subject to child protection laws. Parents in these circumstances speak of ‘being plunged initially into a world of bewilderment, despair and hopelessness; this often becomes worse as they realise there are few quick solutions and they must go through a minefield of legal, cultural and often linguistic barriers to get children back or disputes resolved’. The voices of children who are placed in these circumstances are often never heard. The preamble of the convention states: The best interests of the child are to be a primary consideration in reaching decisions under the terms of the Convention.",142,Representatives Main Committee
371,Ms King,"Too often, children can find themselves in the middle of bitter parental reWednesday, 26 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4521 There is a great deal of lip-service paid to statements such as this without actually enacting them. Every day we continue to hear of cases of children being exploited, being placed in vulnerable circumstances and being abused. That is why Labor has moved an amendment that calls for the underpinning principle of the bill-that is, that the best interests of children are protected-to apply to all matters relating to the care and nurture of children throughout Australia, whether they are Australian citizens or children who are refugees. I want to speak a bit about children in detention here. The Family Law Amendment (Child Protection Convention) Bill 2002 sets out the circumstances in which a Family Court in Australia may exercise jurisdiction with respect to measures to protect a child and includes the circumstance of when a child is present in Australia as a refugee. The bill is silent about those children seeking refugee status. These children are treated as non-citizens, and I would argue that we are treating them as though they are non-human-children like six-year-old Shayan who, after 18 months in an Australian detention centre, had to be hospitalised as he had stopped talking, eating and drinking. I have two women in my electorate who have worked as nurses in Woomera. They told their story to our local newspaper, the Ballarat Courier. In relation to children they had in their care, they told me of children who, on arrival in detention, are healthy, happy and optimistic about their future. Both these nurses told me that the impact of detention on children was severe and that almost all the children experienced severe developmental delay, are well below normal weight and height measures for children of their age and culture, frequently bed-wet and exhibit significant signs of trauma. Both these nurses tell of the stress that they underwent on a daily basis as children begged them to let them stay with them in the nurses’ area rather than being returned to the general detention population. This is nothing short of child abuse. The fact that these children have not had refugee status, or have had their claim rejected but Australia is unable to reach agreement with their country of origin for their return, is no excuse for government sanctioned child abuse. Both these women had no preconceived ideas about Australia’s immigration program; if anything, they tell me that they think that people should not come here unauthorised. They have no agenda to push. They just have what they have seen, their judgment based on years of professional experience and their fundamental decency as members of the Ballarat community who believe that children should never be treated like this. It seems to me that, as we make the formal moves to ratify the child protection convention, we should be taking a hard look at what governments are doing to perpetuate the abuse of children. Detention is no place for children, and I again join with my colleagues in calling on the government to get the children out from behind the razor wire. It seems to me that, given the daily revelations of child abuse and the damage that it has caused countless lives, we should also take a long hard look at establishing a national response to the issue. The establishment of a national child and youth commissioner is long overdue. Children and young people should have an advocate of the highest level. Labor has outlined the roles that a national youth commissioner should play. They include: providing national leadership and advocacy on children’s issues; monitoring the welfare and well-being of Australia’s children regularly and regularly reporting on their status; developing mechanisms to assist the coordination of best practice service models for children and youth programs, including protocols for dealing with child abuse complaints; providing leadership and coordination for a national code on relevant children’s issues in conjunction with the states and territories; picking up on good ideas, such as ‘the working with children check’; identifying and conducting research into children’s issues; promoting relevant public education 4522 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 2002 campaigns; promoting understanding and investment in early childhood development; consulting with children and young people about issues affecting them; reviewing legislation, policies and practices relating to children; and conducting inquiries, reporting to the parliament and making recommendations to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. The report on child protection 2000-01 released in April by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare noted an increase in the number of notifications of child abuse since 1996 and an upward trend in the numbers of children on care and protection orders. These figures show that we are seriously failing young children. We have to focus on doing all we can to prevent abuse and neglect. The government’s focus on standardising mandatory reporting is not enough; it is after the event and it is not going to stop child abuse. We have an obligation to focus on preventing child abuse and neglect happening in the first place. We need to understand and address the complex causal factors and scrutinise the adequacy of current family support programs designed to help parents and their children. The Men and Family Relationships Program is an example of this, and while I welcome the government’s decision to extend funding for a year, it stops woefully short of recognising the importance that this program has in strengthening families and preventing domestic violence and child abuse. We need to stop seeing family support programs such as the provision of child care, income support and family relationship counselling as somehow not being the main game for the federal government. We need a national commissioner for children and youth and we need to put the issue of child protection in the national spotlight. I had the opportunity to speak to Moira Rayner, who was Victoria’s previous sex discrimination commissioner, before she took up the post of children’s commissioner in the UK. On asking her what decided her to take the job, she said something along the lines of: ‘I knew the government was serious about their commitment to children when I turned up for my interview and there wasn’t an adult in sight. The kids ran the interview process and made the decision. How can you a refuse a job that children have chosen you for?’ I think it is a pretty powerful statement by governments and public service departments to give over that much power to children. I hope that when we have a national commissioner for children in Australia we can have as much faith in our children. Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (11.12 a.m.)-In summing up the debate and making some concluding remarks, I would like to thank all honourable members who have contributed to the debate on this most important issue and this significant legislation. The proposed amendments to the Family Law Act will enable Australia to ratify the Hague convention on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and cooperation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children. Ratification of the convention will be of significant benefit to Australian families, particularly to children who are the subject of international family law or child protection litigation. Like it or not, litigation is still the final resort for a minority of parents. Jurisdictional certainty and finality of court orders will be features of the convention. I want to remind members that the objective of the Family Law Amendment (Child Protection Convention) Bill 2002 is to address conflicts in jurisdiction on matters between courts in different countries. At present, there are no clear rules and procedures governing such disputes, with the result that Australian and overseas courts sometimes make conflicting parenting orders in relation to the same children. Authorities in one country may fail to act because they assume that authorities in another country have taken responsibility for a child. The convention and the bill which implements it are designed to overcome these difficulties by providing clear jurisdictional rules for courts here and abroad. The bill also implements arrangements to guarantee the recognition and enforcement in Australia of parenting orders for other Wednesday, 26 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4523 convention countries. It will establish mechanisms to facilitate cooperation between courts in Australia and courts overseas in parental responsibility cases. Under the convention, the parental responsibility of an unmarried Australian father will be automatically recognised in those countries where, ordinarily, a father who is not married to the child’s mother has no rights of custody by operation of law. The convention will also address the problem of international cases involving protection of children from abuse and neglect. It is in the best interests of children that there be internationally agreed rules determining which child protection authorities have jurisdiction in relation to a child. Commonwealth and state officials have been cooperating in the development of an appropriate legislative scheme to implement the convention in Australia. This means that parents will know which countries’ courts will make decisions about their children and will not be subject to uncertainty due to conflicting parenting orders from different courts in different countries. It also means that it will be clear which countries’ child protection authorities have jurisdiction in relation to a child. The convention was drafted by family law experts from 48 countries under the auspices of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, the foremost international organisation in development of modern conflict of laws instruments in the family law area. Few countries have yet ratified the convention, as it was completed only recently; but a number of countries with which Australia has had international family law conflicts cases are working towards ratification. There have been a number of amendments suggested and a number of serious issues raised in relation to the protection of children which cut across several portfolios, and these amendments were moved by the member for Barton and seconded by the member for Gellibrand. I want to say that any further consideration of these issues need not delay progress of this amendment bill. The bill has been considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, and that committee reported last month that the bill should be passed. The convention has been subject to scrutiny by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, with the committee recommending that Australia ratify the convention. now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Barton has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting other words.

I am particularly pleased to see you this morning in the chair and I speak at this time in the absence of the honourable member for Chifley who, no doubt, will be in the chamber shortly. I am quite happy to place on record at this stage my very great respect for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, who is celebrating her Golden Jubilee. interjected is also a very strong supporter of Her Majesty and the role that she has played as the sovereign of this nation during the last 50 years. Indeed, when one considers the passing of Her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother only a short time ago, the entire life of that remarkable lady, in effect, was the period of Federation of this nation. Her Majesty The Queen has been Queen for approximately half of Australia’s period of Federation. During that time Australia has matured as a nation. We have grown up and, indeed, the role of the Queen has altered as the years have gone on. Regardless of the views of individual Australians, Her Majesty is someone whom people broadly recognise as having done an outstanding job, and I consider that all Australians would wish Her Majesty well in this, the year of her Golden Jubilee. Her Majesty was one of two children. The then Princess Elizabeth and her late sister, Princess Margaret, were well known during the period of the war when the royal family chose to stay in the United Kingdom at a time when other royal families, given the threat of invasion and attack, went to safer areas. In fact, when Buckingham Palace was bombed, Her Majesty The Queen Mother made the comment that at last she could look the East End in the face.

Most recently, we were fortunate in Queensland, and in Australia more generally, to have Her Majesty here during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. She was present on the Sunshine Coast. I think she is a person who is a paragon of duty, and people throughout the world recognise her outstanding role. Her Majesty married His Royal Highness Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, in 1947, and they have four children. Everyone knows that those four children have played an important role as members of the royal family. The Prince of Wales is, of course, heir to the throne. Her Majesty was the first monarch to make full use of television. The decision to allow a documentary on the royal family, which was broadcast in 1969, opened up the monarchy to millions of viewers around the world. While at the time many may have thought the documentary was justified as a way of humanising the royals, some observers have said that it opened the way for more intrusive coverage in the late 1990s, which has had quite disastrous consequences. During the past 50 years the Queen and the Duke have done an amazing amount for hundreds of organisations around the world. The Queen pioneered the walkabout. While it must have provided a nightmare for the security officials, the Queen thought that it was appropriate that she and the people of the nations of which she is Queen ought to be able to meet without the oppressive barrier of excessive security. Further statistics reveal that, since 1952, the Queen has conferred 380,630 honours and awards. The Queen has received around three million items of correspondence and she has sent just about 100,000 telegrams to people attaining the age of 100 years in the United Kingdom, Australia and in other countries of the Commonwealth. The Sunshine Coast appears to have large numbers of people of amazing longevity. We regularly hear of telegrams that Her Majesty has sent to constituents of mine on the Sunshine Coast. The Queen is the sixth longest serving monarch and she attained that particular position on 21 June this year. Only five other Kings or Queens in the history of the Commonwealth have reigned for 50 years or more, these being: Queen Victoria, George III, Henry III, Edward III and James VI of Scotland, who subsequently became JamesI of England. Queen Elizabeth is the 40th monarch since William the Conqueror obtained the Crown of the England. Her Majesty is someone who travels widely and it is probably regrettable that the Queen has not visited Australia more in recent years. I suspect that, given the republican debate, the Queen did not want to be seen to be influencing the people of Australia one way or the other. She is a profoundly correct constitutional monarch and maybe she felt that it was inappropriate for her to visit this nation while we were sorting out our constitutional future. History, of course, recognises that the people of Australia voted in the referendum to maintain our links with the monarchy. All states and a national majority voted to preserve our current system of government, which has given this nation freedom, stability and a way of life that is the envy of people throughout the world. The Queen has visited Australia twice since, and I hope that we will see the monarch visiting on very many more occasions. It is also interesting to note that, regardless of the point of view of individuals in relation to the Constitution, whenever the Queen has visited Australia she has been received with courtesy. There was some worry that when the Queen was present those who had lost the republican debate might see it appropriate to take out their loss on the monarch, but happily that was 4526 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 2002 not the Australian way. It is a credit to all people that Her Majesty received the usual warm welcome that she always does. I believe that our current system of government serves Australia well. We do now effectively have an Australian as head of state: the Governor General, who carries out all day-today functions of the monarch in Australia. Australia has been through a period of constitutional evolution and it would be unthinkable for the Queen herself today to interfere with the day-to-day constitutional arrangements in this nation. I suppose in many respects, as a country, we have our cake and we eat it too. We have all of the benefits of a constitutional monarchy and we have all the benefits of a republic. Australia has been declared by some to be a crowned republic. While that is probably not an appropriate term, it does indicate that sovereignty resides with the people and shows that we have a system with democratic elections. When one turns on one’s television set and looks at what happens in other countries around the world that do not enjoy our democratic traditions, it can be seen that the current system of government has served Australia well. From my point of view, I am very happy to see that system continue and was relieved to see that system supported in the referendum. In a way, maybe the result of the referendum also recognised the fact that Australians saw the Queen as having done her duty during very trying personal circumstances over a very long period. I have a lot more information in relation to Her Majesty The Queen, but time is short. In my constituency, a majority of some 63 per cent voted no in the referendum, and on their behalf I can say that we greatly admire the role that the Queen has carried out and her continued service. I am hopeful that she and her successors will be given the opportunity to continue as Australia’s sovereigns in the future, bearing in mind that we already have an Australian head of state in the person of His Excellency the Governor General. speaker, the member for Fisher-who had 63 per cent of his constituency vote against the republic-I would rise to speak on this particular motion having had 66 per cent of my constituents support the republic; but in fact many of us who are republicans have a benign view of the Queen for the reasons described by the member for Fisher. I think many of us, who appreciate the kind of democracy we live in, understand that this is the Anglo-Saxon tradition that has been passed down to us. It is not the only tradition in this country anymore; we do appreciate the rule of law, the separation of powers and the ability to laugh at ourselves, which we have learnt from the English. That sense of irony, that madcap sense of humour, is perhaps unparalleled in any other country in the world that the English inhabit. I certainly appreciate that as something that most Australians enjoy, participate in and reflect in their own regard for themselves. In particular, the ability to laugh at ourselves is one that not too many people in other countries have. The success of the current monarch is largely due to her own personal attitude and the modernisation of the monarchy as well as her ability to eschew that sense of privilege that many Australians in an egalitarian society find alienating. The current monarch is able to mix very well with her subjects, both in the United Kingdom and in other countries of the Commonwealth, when she visits them. The member for Fisher talked, for instance, about the messages that people receive on appropriate occasions. Of course, many of our constituents all appreciated the messages they received on their 100th birthday. I have seen many of those messages delivered in my electorate. At the same time, events that underline that old-fashioned sense of privilege make many people uncomfortable with the divine right of kings and with the monarchy in general.

376,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (11.30 A.m.),"It is a bit odd that following the previousWednesday, 26 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4527 of the events outlined by the member for Werriwa yesterday in the House of Representatives included the treatment of Australia’s Prime Minister. While I am a member of the opposition, I do find it unpleasant to have to read that, when the Prime Minister was in London for the funeral of the Queen Mother, there was a proposal to take him and the other prime ministers by bus to Westminster Abbey. Only as a result of the insistence of the high commissioners were the prime ministers taken there by car. In fact, they were seated in a position in Westminster Abbey where they could not see the ceremonies, so they had no contact with the mourning family. Indeed, our Prime Minister was seated behind Prince Ernest August of Hanover. It is quite understandable that, at a subsequent meeting at the foreign office with the British Prime Minister, the three foreign prime ministers from Canada, Australia and New Zealand apparently expressed their outrage at this expression of raw privilege. At least one vowed never to return to the United Kingdom. I suspect that was not, as the member for Werriwa says, our Prime Minister. These kinds of events need to be treated with sensitivity in the modern age. I am sure that the current monarch, if she had known about it, would have had nothing to do with these arrangements. I suspect that it was some middle-ranking official who became very officious during all of these events who was responsible for this and did not understand that in the modern world you cannot humiliate democratically elected leaders by making them sit behind Prince Ernest August of Hanover. I want to take this opportunity to focus on some of the events around the death of the Queen Mother that I believe go to the great credit of the royal family. Many of them were mentioned in the speeches on the Queen Mother’s death but I think this an appropriate occasion to return to them. First of all, we remember, as many people from both sides noticed, to the Queen Mother’s great credit, that during the Second World War she refused to leave London. I believe her remark went something to the effect of: ‘The King won’t go, the children won’t go and I certainly won’t go.’ I remember in many of the contributions that at the time Hitler described her as ‘the most dangerous woman’-from his point of view, obviously-‘in Europe’. I think that related to a very famous film clip where she went into the East End of London in the middle of the Blitz, put down flowers and greeted some of the poorest people in London who were being bombed by the Germans and had had their houses destroyed. The effect of someone of such great privilege going there and identifying with her own people obviously was understood by the Nazi propagandists to be very dangerous for their cause. I notice that the Prime Minister also said that, during the Blitz, the Queen Mother said that she was going to learn to shoot, and in fact she learnt to shoot in the grounds of Buckingham Palace, because she did not want to go as easily as those other European monarchs. This was an odd remark, given the fact that she was sheltering Queen Wilhelmina of Holland, but I suppose it underlined the English attitude to King Leopold of Belgium, whom the English quite rightly regarded as giving up the game a bit too early. I wanted this opportunity to reflect on some newly available facts that speculate about why the royal family, and the late Queen Mother in particular, never forgave the abdicated Edward VIII-the Queen Mother’s brother-in-law-and his wife Wallis Simpson or welcomed them back to England and into the bosom of the royal family. First of all, the most important thing to understand about this is that she and the royal family understood what Churchill understood and wrote and broadcast about and which was the attitude of the free world at the time: the fight with Nazism was literally a fight to the death. Edward VIII was very strongly supported by Churchill in the period of his abdication, and that is a fortunate fact of history which I will return to in a minute. 4528 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 2002 In a recently published book, the masterful historian John Lukacs discusses those vital few days in London in the British war cabinet after the fall of France, 24 to 28 May 1940, when the fate of democracy, the advance of mankind, was in the balance. Let us remember the Nazis were in total control of all of Europe, the Soviet Union in an alliance with Nazi Germany and the United States not involved in the war. Edward VIII had been in the south of France and was taken to Spain and then to Portugal. It was a very close-run thing whether he would return to his duties, as desired by the British war cabinet-they wanted him to be High Commissioner to the Bahamas. Various important agents of the SD were trying to inveigle him to become what can only be described as a traitor king following an invasion by the Nazis of Britain. In the book Five Days in London by John Lukacs, he describes the fact that, despite what was thought at the time and all the subsequent information we have about the United Kingdom, it was a very close-run thing whether the British would surrender. There was a proposal that Lord Halifax had from the Italian Ambassador to London, which meant that a treaty would have been entered into, leaving the Germans and Italians in control of all of Europe and, on the other hand, the British in control of their colonies, with their navy. It would have been a very tempting offer for Britain to accept. In those circumstances the Queen Mother understood that, if her brother-in-law had been monarch at the time and a person to whom Churchill would have listened, the pressure from members of the war cabinet who wanted to accept a surrender or peace treaty with Nazi dominated Europe, together with a monarch who had been in the company of Herr Hitler would have been very great. The behaviour of Edward VIII in Portugal seemed to many people in the United Kingdom to indicate that he might accept Nazi blandishments, and this would have been extremely worrying. In the second volume of Churchill’s wartime memoirs, it is clear that only his letter to Edward VIII made the former king accept the decision to go to the Bahamas and take the job as High Commissioner and not be captured as the spokesman for Nazi Germany and become, as I said, the potential traitor king for an invaded Britain. I do not wish to distract the Australian parliament any longer with obscure musings on English history, but I believe that, because of our common traditions, to a large extent Britain’s history is our history. You can judge the measure of someone by how they behave in a conflict, particularly in a desperate life and death struggle like the Second World War. The understandable attitude of the British monarchy to Edward VIII because of the potential role that they saw him fulfilling is very understandable and, in my view, very commendable. It says a lot about the English monarchy-our constitutional rulers at the moment. Notwithstanding that admiration, I believe-and I believe the majority of the Australian people believe-that we should move to another form of government, namely an Australian republic, a system which, perhaps, will not be disrupted by direct election of republicans at the next referendum opportunity. in congratulating Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on her golden jubilee. I wish to talk about three things: her contribution to Australia, her life and some of her enduring achievements, and the legacy that she leaves for us. In considering the contribution Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has made to Australia, we need to go back to her first visit to Australia as monarch in 1954. During that time, she created for herself a great bond with the people of Australia. Over time, that has helped to transcend political debates. It has provided a point of affection for Australians in their focus on a particular institutional figure. It has perhaps been best evidenced through her direct contribution to an Australian institution, namely the Royal Flying Doctor Service. On 15 March 1963,",154,Representatives Main Committee
377,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (11.42 A.m.),"It is a great honour and pleasure to rise and join othersWednesday, 26 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4529 while visiting Alice Springs, the Queen broadcast on radio and across the Royal Flying Doctor Service a message of support for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. She spoke directly to people from the most outlying areas of Australia and, in so doing, she reached out to them in a personal and direct way. At the same time, she made an extraordinary contribution to the morale and the force of community recognition of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. During her broadcast of 15 March 1963, she said very clearly: TodayI am speaking to you from the Flying Doctor base at Alice Springs. The late Doctor John Flynn, the founder of the service, once said: ‘If you start a good idea nothing will stop it.’ The truth of his prediction has been proved by the enormous development of the service now operating from thirteen bases and covering a vast area of central Australia. She went on to say: Having a family myself, I fully understand what this mantle of safety must mean to wives and mothers and the encouragement it gives to new families to move out to develop these lonely areas. At a very practical level this was about making a contribution to the institutions and the life of Australia. On behalf of all Australians, I acknowledge that and thank Her Majesty for that work, which has contributed to the development of a critical institution concerned with the care and protection of rural families. That is part of her work and her contribution to Australia. After her 50 years as monarch, there are a number of key things that we need to be aware of. Firstly, she becomes one of only six monarchs in the history of the British kingdom to have reigned for 50 years or more. She is the 40th monarch since William the Conqueror obtained the crown of England. She plays a very important role in offering care and concern for people throughout the Commonwealth. She has conferred over 380,000 honours and awards, conducted over 460 investitures, outlasted nine previous prime ministers and is now with the first prime minister born after the commencement of her reign. Above all else, there has been a set of what I believe are four significant symbolic achievements. The first is to be a figurehead for not just the United Kingdom but the Commonwealth as a whole. In so doing, she has generated great affection and been a point of unity for people from throughout the Commonwealth. Secondly, she has developed the respect of individuals through her personal conduct and contribution to the work of the nation and of charities. Thirdly, she has helped oversee a transition to a modern monarchy, one that lives with all its flaws and faults in the glare of public attention. She has managed this transition through her own personal conduct being beyond and above reproach on all occasions. Fourthly, she and her family have been tireless workers for charities. In Australia there are numerous charities and organisations which seek the royal imprimatur and which believe that they are stronger for their links to the organisation. That is a great contribution which the Queen has made. I do not wish to speak about political arrangements today. This is not the time nor the place for it. I simply wish to say that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II deserves our congratulations on her Jubilee. She has served the Commonwealth well and Australia well and has done so with particular personal grace. She has been a figurehead, has earned respect and has overseen the transition to a modern monarchy. In so doing, she has earned the great affection, admiration and trust of the people of Australia. already spoken on behalf of the Australian Labor Party and its supporters in conveying our congratulations to Her Majesty on the occasion of her Golden Jubilee.

378,Mr Price (Chifley) (11.48 A.m.),"Our leader, Simon Crean, the member for Hotham, has4530 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 2002 It is fair to say that the Queen is a much admired person, deeply respected by all Australians. I certainly am one such person, although I am also a republican. As I was walking up here to speak on this motion, I reflected that there were three occasions when I saw the Queen. I remember being at Cowra, where my father was a fencing contractor. As primary school students we were rounded up in the local park, and Her Majesty and her consort drove in a jeep up and down. I have a very vivid recollection of that event. The other was that the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were gracious enough to open the Mount Druitt Hospital. At the time. I was the deputy chairman of it. As I constantly point out, a want of ecclesiastical qualifications prevented me from being the chairman of the board. I know that it created a great impact on our community at the time. Of course, the other occasion was the opening of this parliament, in which many others participated. I do want to thank her for her dedication and contribution. Rather cheekily, I thought that as Her Majesty is the Queen of Australia. I should really get the library to search out how many days in that 50 years she was in Australia. But with her title of Queen of Australia we do not expect her to reside in this great land of ours. It is also true that she has in her time seen the waning of the empire and the establishment of the Commonwealth and of CHOGM. Our Prime Minister recently chaired this significant institution and was very much concerned about what was happening in Zimbabwe. Without in any way wishing to diminish the efforts of the Prime Minister or of the Commonwealth, whilst there was some action, it did not go to the extent that all honourable members would wish to see in that unhappy country. I find it ironic that, as the member for Chifley, I have had opportunities to speak on the passing of Her Royal Highness Princess Margaret, to speak on this motion and to speak on the passing of the Queen Mother, an opportunity which I did not exercise. It is ironic that, as members of this House, we do not get an opportunity to speak on the commitment of our troops to Afghanistan. I am one of those members who strongly supports the commitment of our troops to Afghanistan and the war on terrorism. We do not get an opportunity to speak on the Prime Minister’s visit to America. Without in any way wishing to sit in judgment on the success or otherwise of that visit, I think it is important to say that this visit, post September 11-a seminal event for the American nation and indeed for the world-was a very important visit to that country. As members of parliament we do not get an opportunity to talk about that, because there has been no ministerial statement. Unfortunately there was a death of a member of the SAS in Afghanistan and we had no way of expressing our appreciation as a nation to that solider and particularly to his family. There is no question about the job the SAS have done, and are doing, in Afghanistan, but there is no discussion about whether there is an exit strategy for Australia in Afghanistan or in East Timor. I mentioned that I was a republican. I see the honourable member for Mackellar here and I think it is very fair that she should take some credit for a very successful campaign on the occasion of the referendum about a republic. Whilst all members respect the Queen, I think it is fair to say that on our side of politics particularly, but not exclusively, we are republican. We believe that in this new century and this new millennium it is not appropriate that someone who is not an Australian and does not reside here should be our head of state. I know we are getting into a debate about who is our head of state, but I thought the proof was in the pudding when the Prime Minister went to the funeral of the Queen Mother. He said it was appropriate that as Prime Minister he should go, and I agree that it was. But the Governor General, our vice-regal representative, did not go and represent Australia. I would have thought that, if we did have a republic and a president, we would have both the president of Australia and the Prime Minister at such an important occasion. I look forward to the opporWednesday, 26 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4531 tunity for a further debate about the republic. I commend Kim Beazley for his proposition that there should be two referendums. The people of Australia should be asked whether or not they wish to have an Australian republic. If that vote is resolved in the affirmative-that is, a majority of Australians and a majority of people in the states feel that way-then we can go forward and refine some models. I accepted the argument that there should be no direct election of a president but, having seen the results of the referendum, particularly in my own electorate, when-again, full credit to the honourable member for Mackellar-it was overwhelmingly carried that there should be no republic, I am inclined to the view that if the people say they want the direct election of a president then we ought to have the direct election of a president. To the many lawyers in this parliament-some on our side; more on the government side-I say that we need to work through the difficulties that this presents. But you cannot afford to ignore the wishes of the people. As a member of parliament who has been here for a little while, I look forward to a new republican debate. I look forward to a new referendum, where the people of Australia will be given the opportunity to decide whether or not they wish Australia to become a republic-a question as simple as yes or no. Then we would go on, as I say, to the second stage of the debate. But having said that, the people of Australia should be under no illusions. The majority of countries that form the Commonwealth are in fact republics. The Queen, as the head of the Commonwealth, will still have a role in Australia, and I am sure she would be most welcome on any occasion that she would seek to visit this country and would be treated with the same warmth and affection that she has always received. I know there was some controversy when Prime Minister Keating was in power, and it revolved around the touching of the royal personage. But there was nothing in that, in my view, that was intended to be disrespectful of the Queen. It was more the polite concern of one individual for another, as the Queen was being escorted through the crowd. I conclude on this point: we always should have had this debate. It would have been scandalous to have left the passing of such an important milestone uncommented on by this House. But it shows the government’s priorities. We cannot talk about and debate the Prime Minister’s important visit to America after September 11. We cannot talk about and debate the commitment of troops. We cannot give the troops that we have sent overseas-in particular the SAS, who are very much in harm’s way and are doing an outstanding job-the knowledge that they go about their task with the full support of each and every member of this House. We cannot even have a debate about the newly announced Australian policy of endorsing America’s first-strike policy. I do not know how many members here are concerned about the current situation in the Middle East. The President of America has made an important announcement. There will be no debate in this House about how Australia responds to that initiative and what our expectation will be of that delivering peace. I despair that, when we look around the globe, we still see so much these days of the old evils of terror, of inhumanity toward people, of hunger and of people being dispossessed. Not only do we have a responsibility as a middle sized country but we have a responsibility as a democracy to consider these issues and to have the opportunity to make comment. Let me finish on this note: the government very proudly announced its budget, and there was an extensive debate on the appropriations. An important part of the scrutiny of a government’s budget-both by the opposition, I might say, and also by its own members-is to have a debate on the various portfolios, but all that was truncated. Again, I am a little worried; I have paid at least three compliments to the honourable member for Mackellar, but I commend 4532 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 2002 her for her desire to bring about possible reform in this area. AgainI point out: we are elected representatives in this place. We welcome the opportunity to speak on the passing of the Princess Royal and the Queen Mother and on the Golden Jubilee. That is appropriate. But what about all the other important issues? Should we not be able to say to our constituents, ‘Yes, we considered these matters. They were discussed in the party room and, yes, I put my views on the Hansard record.’ We are being denied the opportunity. We are seen as democratic eunuchs in this place because of the priorities of this government and the lack of appropriate time allocated to debate significant issues. I will finish where I left off: I wish to pass on my personal and my constituents’ congratulations to Her Majesty on her Golden Jubilee. I believe, as I said earlier, she is one of the women most admired in Australia. In saying that, I acknowledge that as being a truth-and I do not resile from the fact that I also long for a republic. kind compliments from the honourable member for Chifley and to further note what wise constituents he had when it came to voting on the referendum. I might say that there we have a connection, because my constituents also voted no. In rising to address this motion to take note of the Address of Congratulation to Her Majesty The Queen on the Golden Jubilee, I do so realising what an amazing change of history Her Majesty’s reign has spanned. She became queen as such a young girl, in her early twenties in 1952, upon the death of her father, and has seen the changes that have taken place across the world in that period and yet has remained a person who has earned the respect of not only the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth as a whole but also, very much so, the people of Australia. Our system of governance works for us, and you could call us a ‘crowned republic’, because we have all the benefits of a system that a republic perhaps holds out and yet we have the stability of having a constitutional monarchy, which gives us a stability that-certainly if you look at the history of republics around the world-republics do not seem to enjoy. If you look in our own region, you can see that Thailand and Malaysia enjoy a monarchical system. You can see that Spain was only able to return democracy to that country by restoring the monarchy. So, as an institution, I think monarchy has a good track record. Her Majesty, in the 50 years of her reign, has had great sadnesses and tragedies in her life, and also great joys. I suppose that is something which ordinary folk, including us, can identify with. There has been a lot written about the royal family, their collapsing marriages, their foibles or whatever, yet in reality I suppose it makes them just a bit more like us. There have been changing mores in that 50-year period, yet the institution of the monarchy has remained steadfast. She was always there as the reliable monarch in whom confidence could be had. For our part, as I said, our system works and gives us the benefit of that concept of a crowned republic. Our head of state is our Governor General and the monarch exercises her authority or her powers with regard to us in accordance with the doctrine of the divisibility of the Crown-an interesting doctrine that means that when she is dealing with matters of Australia as the Queen of Australia, she exclusively looks at the laws of Australia and the needs of Australia, but all power, in terms of ability to appoint and sack prime ministers, lies in the hands of the Governor General. IfI were to devise a test as to whether or not the Governor General was the head of state, I certainly would not be using as a test whether or not he attended a funeral. I would be saying: who has the power to appoint and sack a Prime Minister? And we know the answer to that question.",157,Representatives Main Committee
379,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (Mackellar) (12.02 P.m.),"I was going to begin by noting theWednesday, 26 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4533 In the same year as the Queen celebrates her Golden Jubilee, she of course has also lost her mother and her sister. The tragedy of losing those people who were so close to her must have placed a very marked dampener on what would otherwise have been a year full of rejoicing. However, anyone who saw the television footage of the concerts on the lawn of Buckingham Palace could see that she was certainly enjoying her Golden Jubilee and, more particularly, so were the people who attended. Two million people applied for tickets to attend those two concerts. They included some Australians, because I tried hard for a couple of my constituents, but they did not get in the ballot. If we reflect upon how Her Majesty is regarded by people across the world, perhaps it is in contrast to the way other monarchs have been regarded during other periods in history. If we look back to the Victorian era, we can think of the power of Queen Victoria when she was the head of a great empire, yet people very often forget that she was a vastly unpopular figure for many years of her reign and really did have to be, shall we say, cajoled into coming back into contact with the people over whom she reigned. Queen Elizabeth II has never endured that sort of ignominy. She has had, in her own terms, an annus horribilis in one particular year; she has had her sadnesses and her joys. But may we simply say: God save the Queen. ourable members in marking Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth’s Golden Jubilee and in supporting the Prime Minister’s address of congratulations to the Queen on this occasion. It is appropriate that the parliament, in a spirit of bipartisanship, considers the address which extends our warm congratulations at this time of celebration of the Golden Jubilee of her accession to the throne and expresses our respect and regard for the dedication she has displayed in the service of the Commonwealth and her deep and abiding commitment to Australia and her people. The Queen’s reign has been, by so many measures, a remarkable period. As the Prime Minister noted in his address, just three other British monarchs have reigned for longer and she will overtake all their records in just 13 years time. The Prime Minister also noted that 10 British prime ministers have come and gone in that 50-year period and, as our head of state, she has seen 10 Australian prime ministers in office and has appointed 11 governors-general. The length of her reign is particularly poignant to me because I was born in the year the Queen commenced her reign. To think of the commitment and dedication involved in fulfilling her responsibilities over a period equivalent to my lifetime marked by extraordinary social, political and economic change is quite remarkable. It is not just the length of the Queen’s reign that is significant. She has had to meet many personal and other challenges in that time. One not often appreciated is the change in the nature of the Crown itself from that of an imperial head of state to leadership of a significant group of like-minded states that form the Commonwealth of Nations. At the same time she has watched, if not encouraged, Australia to grow to the strong, independent nation we have become today, not just by her visits but also by her advice and her example of tolerance and virtue. Many have commented on the changes that have occurred around the world during the course of her reign. Part of her success is that, perhaps like the great passenger liner that bears her mother’s name, she has moved with the currents of time and evolving attitudes while maintaining a steady course as the centre of those traditions that typify Westminster’s democracy. Is it any wonder that she has been described by His Honour Justice Kirby as the most successful female politician of the 20th century?",160,Representatives Main Committee

I suspect that both those who support the monarchy in that country and those who would prefer a different system have been taken aback by the extent of the public support for the Jubilee that we all observed during that almost tumultuous weekend earlier this month. The size of the crowds and the resounding sounds of hundreds of thousands of Britons joining in one voice to their various national anthems and songs were clearly not just the result of pageantry and pop stars. They reflected the enduring respect that the peoples of the United Kingdom have for their Queen and for the institution that she represents. I have heard first-hand reports from some of those that joined Britons for that celebratory weekend. My friend and constituent, Peter Cavanagh, was one of those in the crowd representing the Australian Commonwealth society. He has told me of the genuine excitement amongst the populace in London that day and the dizzying levels of patriotism and national pride. He also mentioned his pride in attending, as a guest of our High Commission, the raising of the flags of the Commonwealth of Nations in the grounds of Marlborough House, the Commonwealth headquarters, in the hours preceding the commencement of the celebrations. It is interesting to reflect on the level of support that the Queen and the royal family continue to receive in the United Kingdom. Clearly, part of it is British admiration for tradition and an institution that has been at the apex of the United Kingdom’s political and cultural life for so many centuries. But it is more than that. A constitutional monarchy, by its very nature, relies more than any other system of government on the maintenance of support for the individual who occupies the throne. Support for Britain’s monarchy has waxed and waned over the centuries, most frequently as a reflection of British society’s respect for the monarch of the day. Of course, that is not entirely so. There are those in Britain who, for ideological reasons, will always advocate different forms of government no matter how highly they regard their king or queen. Perhaps in time that sentiment may change, but it is hard to see, following the support demonstrated for the royal family during the course of this year. That very personal nature of the monarchy and the fact that it remains held in such high respect in the United Kingdom is perhaps the greatest testimony to the service that has been given by the Queen. She has steadfastly devoted her life to public service and acquitted her responsibilities with great dignity, compassion and commitment and she has performed her responsibilities as constitutional head of state with great tact and respect for the democratic processes of that country. In Australia, we have not seen mass outpourings of celebrations for the Jubilee. While some have seen that as a reflection of a republican spirit, I suspect it is just as much a sign of the different and mature attitude that we have towards the Queen and our great respect for her. I have no doubt of the affection in which the Queen is held in this country and the respect Australians have for her service as both our constitutional head of state and her role as head of the Commonwealth of Nations. That respect transcends the borders of the republican debate. The fact that the Queen was never a part of the republican movement’s campaign for change reflects the admiration in which we all hold her for the service she gives to our country. I wish the Queen and her family well during the course of the celebrations that she well and truly deserves for her half-century of dedication to those vows she took at her coronation 49 years ago. Golden Jubilee year. As Australia’s constitutional monarch over the past 50 years, the Queen",161,Representatives Main Committee
381,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (12.15 P.m.),"I rise to congratulate the Queen on herWednesday, 26 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4535 has symbolically been our head of state for half our nation’s history since Federation. Throughout those 50 years, the Queen has reigned over a period which has seen significant transformation in the way we live. Improved communications, a change in the dynamics of society and the ongoing challenges of maintaining a safe and secure world have all contributed to a new world order. The Queen has presided over those times with a tremendous sense of dignity. While some sceptics today question the role of the British monarch, I believe the public’s genuine affection for Queen Elizabeth remains undeniably strong across the Commonwealth. The warmth with which she is considered by many Australians not only is a reflection of the depth of feeling towards her in our nation but recognises the close rapport she has developed with the Australian people and the 54 independent countries who make up the Commonwealth. While we now live in a global economy, it is quite easy to overlook the benefits of the Commonwealth as it fosters international cooperation and trade links between people all over the world. The Queen has made a vital contribution to the maintenance of the Commonwealth since she inherited the throne following the unexpected death of King George VI in 1952. From the earliest days, the Queen took on her new role with energetic commitment. She not only fulfilled her political obligations admirably but also was very proactive in meeting her duties within the Commonwealth. Within the first years of her reign, the Queen travelled to many parts of the Commonwealth never visited before by her predecessors. The Queen also conducted state visits to countries including Norway, Sweden, Portugal, France, Denmark, the USA and the Netherlands. This approach not only consolidated the role of the monarch within the Commonwealth but raised the profile of the monarch in many other countries. Throughout her early days, the Queen also had to balance her public duties with the needs of her family. Family life remained an essential part of her life throughout her official duties. As well as being sovereign, the Queen was a mother of two young children. She had two young children to care for at the time her father died. With the birth of Prince Andrew in 1960, the Queen became the first reigning sovereign to give birth since Queen Victoria, who had her youngest child, Princess Beatrice, in 1857. But the birth of other child did not dampen her desire to make the work of the monarchy accessible to an even wider range of people. During her visit to Australia and New Zealand in 1970, for example, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh initiated a new practice-the walkabout-to allow them to meet as many people as possible. Increased access to the lives of the members of the royal family by the media was also allowed. In an effort to break down the barriers and division which had been created over time, the Queen made several historic overseas visits during the sixties. One such visit was to West Germany, the first since World War II. She encouraged other members of the royal family to attend independence ceremonies for countries formerly of the British Empire, giving rise to the Commonwealth in its present form as a network of countries sharing friendship across the globe. Her empathy for the people of rural and regional Australia was always prevalent. But it was probably best personified in 1963 when she visited the home of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. She made a historic speech across the Royal Flying Doctor Service radio network, paying tribute to those Australians who had pioneered the development of regions outside metropolitan Australia. Over her 50 years as Australia’s head of state the Queen has visited Australia some 14 times, evidence of her love for our country and her status within our nation. On the international stage, too, there have been several firsts. The Queen paid a historic visit 4536 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 2002 to communist Yugoslavia, travelled to Japan as a guest of Emperor Hirohito, was the first British sovereign to travel to the Middle East in 1979 and visited Pope John Paul II in the Vatican in 1980. The Commonwealth has continued to go from strength to strength. The Queen as head of the Commonwealth visited Ottawa at the time of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting being held there. Since then the Queen has been present in the host country for every its principles. While many of her duties have been ceremonially and diplomatically based, the Queen has also addressed a number of difficult issues as the head of the British armed forces. In the 1980s there were two conflicts involving UK servicemen and women. British troops travelled to the South Atlantic in 1982 to recover the Falkland Islands in South Georgia. The Queen shared the anxiety of many mothers of men and women serving in that conflict, with Prince Andrew the pilot of a Sea King helicopter during that war. In the second conflict British forces travelled to the Gulf in the Middle East in 1991 to assist the allied action to drive out the Iraqi forces from occupied Kuwait. The Queen led the ceremonial commemoration of an event in the Second World War, the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. In more recent times the Queen has continued to break down political and religious barriers. History was made in 1982 when Pope John Paul II visited Britain, the first pope to do so for some 450 years. If one looks back over the past 50 years, the last five decades are littered with positive contributions that Queen Elizabeth II has made. From an Australian’s perspective you only have to look at the stability that our governments provide to recognise that the system we have enjoyed works extremely well compared with the alternatives. The ongoing success of that system is in part due to the manner in which it is administered by its leaders. The Queen has had to handle some sensitive and at times controversial constitutional issues over the years. She has done so with skill, integrity and propriety. In the 50th anniversary year, many Australians felt for Queen Elizabeth II following the loss of her sister Margaret and the much loved Queen Mother. IndeedI was privileged to speak recently at functions conducted by the Macksville, Eungai and Wooli-Minnie Waters branches of the CWA. The Wooli-Minnie Waters branch share their 50th birthday with the Golden Jubilee of the Queen. I was most honoured to attend the 50th birthday of the WooliMinnie Waters CWA branch. Organisations such as the CWA are very focused on and aware of the positive contributions that the Queen and the monarchy have made to our country and are absolute and staunch supporters of the monarchy. Anyone who has any doubts with regard to the impact of Queen Elizabeth on the lives of Australians should speak to people such as Laurel Heaton, Lorna Power and Margaret Rumbel from Eungai CWA or perhaps Janice Wilkinson, Noni Bailey and Lyn Wilson from the Wooli-Minnie Waters branch of the CWA. We all congratulate Her Majesty on her Golden Jubilee year and thank her for presiding over a system that has been an integral part of the development of our nation. Many residents of the city of Coffs Harbour within my electorate fondly recall 1970 when the Queen visited Coffs Harbour. It is my recollection that the Royal yacht Britannia actually came into the harbour in that year. Her Majesty took time to meet many local people and visited many of the local attractions of which we are so proud. A number of ladies from the CWA branches across my electorate expressed to me their admiration of the Queen and the mixed emotions that she must feel in a year which recognises such a great achievement. In conclusion I would like to congratulate Her Majesty the Queen on her Golden Jubilee year and thank her for her contribution to our great nation. Wednesday, 26 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4537 Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (12.23 p.m.)-It is with great pleasure that I also rise today to congratulate Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the celebration of her Golden Jubilee. There are few British monarchs who have achieved golden jubilee status. Indeed the records are scarce as to how the likes of Henry III, Edward III and James VI celebrated their 50-year milestones. The first British monarch to celebrate a golden jubilee in a significant way was George III, followed by Queen Victoria. The Queen celebrated her Silver Jubilee in 1977-25 years on the throne. Her Majesty’s service to the Commonwealth for 50 years demonstrates her energy and commitment to her position and subjects. On the day of her accession in 1952, Queen Elizabeth praised her father and dedicated her reign to using his standard as the measure for her role as a monarch. Her Majesty declared that she would continue to work as he had done in upholding constitutional government and advancing the happiness and the prosperity of her peoples as they were spread throughout the world. King George VI was the most significant influence, along with her mother, in how she saw her role as the monarch and how that role has changed and adapted. The world and the monarchy have both experienced considerable change in the last 50 years. We saw the end of the Cold War and the beginning of a new millennium. We saw new nations formed and medical breakthroughs occur. Today we can expect to live 10 years longer than we did in the era of our parents and we can also expect to lead much healthier and fitter lives well beyond retirement. In all of this, the Queen has held steadfastly to the ideals that were instilled in her by both of her parents while facing the growing complexity of this world. British Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke of this in his speech to honour the Queen on her Golden Jubilee. He remarked that the Queen’s Golden Jubilee was a remarkable achievement, not simply for maintaining the throne for such a period, but for making changes despite being in a world that often pays ‘scant regard to tradition and often values passing fashions above enduring faith’. In a world of 24-hour a day media the Queen has displayed calm and strength. Her reign is also testimony to the changing tide of the monarchy and its ability to adapt to changes in society. She has indeed stood the test of time and the often fickle tastes of fashion and society. Her Majesty is prized for her courage, her determination and her ability to progress through those most difficult of times. The photos of the young princess in army attire during World War II demonstrated the tenacity that would sustain her during her 50-year reign. As a young princess she showed spirit and determination, like that of her mother when she assisted in Britain’s war effort. At the Queen Mother’s funeral earlier this year the Cockney King and the people of East London showed their respect for the Queen Mother, who remained in London during the Blitz. Her natural warmth helped usher in a more human face to the royal family, one that has continually been endorsed by the Queen herself. Her Majesty has stood tall and maintained a strong demeanour, despite facing her own annus horribilis. She won the hearts of many when she told the world in 1992 that the year had not been its best. She also won admiration when she admitted that the year was not one that she would look back on with any great fondness. But she saw its impact as positive. She spoke of how criticism could be beneficial for those in public life and how criticism can sometimes effect positive change. Her frankness humanised this very remarkable woman. It brought back to the present day overtures of her coronation speech on the evening of 2 June 1953 when, with sincerity and realism for the future, she said: I am sure that this, my Coronation, is not the symbol of a power and of a splendour that are gone but a declaration of our hopes for the future, and for the years I may, by God’s Grace and Mercy, be given to reign and serve as your Queen. 4538 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 26 June 2002 Although deference sometimes may be given by birth right, admiration and affection are earned. In the years following her most horrible year, much has happened to the royal family. The death of Princess Diana in 1997 demonstrated the way in which the lives of royalty can touch us so deeply. The gradual awakening of the younger royals has once again seen the monarchy given new verve, but with one constant-that of the Queen. Today, support for the monarchy in Britain is at one of its highest levels in decades and the monarchy has Queen Elizabeth to thank for this. In his sermon to honour Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on her Golden Jubilee, the Archbishop of Canterbury stated that, unlike much in this modern world, where more and more relationships are tested and often break down, the Queen’s relationship with her people has grown, and grown stronger with the passage of time. It is significant that we honour our monarch in this Golden Jubilee. This year has been a very sad year for her. She has seen the passing of her sister and her mother in a year marking her accession to the throne. It also serves as a reminder of the death of her father, King George VI. Her sister, Princess Margaret, the Princess Royal, was buried on the same day 50 years on as her father had been. Although this is a year of celebration and triumph, it is also tinged with sadness at the passing of those who have been with her during that 50-year reign. To simply call the past 50 years of Her Majesty’s reign ‘a period of service’ would be to discount the commitment she has shown, despite changes in her own family and in society as a whole. There have been few centuries to rival the 20th century, with its political and demographic changes. Although the British Empire has changed its boundaries over this period, the resurgence of the likes of the Commonwealth Games and CHOGM recently held in Queensland have continued to encourage a sense of unity among nations dispersed throughout the world. I will always remember fondly the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. They were quite unique. They encouraged more worldwide interest in Brisbane and Queensland and helped to place Brisbane as a suitable contender for World Expo in 1988. The Queen showed that she clearly enjoyed the games, and when the giant mascot, Matilda the kangaroo, winked at the crowd, the Queen was seen to smile and enjoy the quaintness of the act. The people of Brisbane and the people of my electorate of Petrie have very fond memories of the Queen’s visits to our city and our state. I want to pay tribute to the Redcliffe Constitutional Monarchists Association and also to the late Peter Josland for much of the work he did with regard to the monarchy. We are the people of her Commonwealth and we are very proud to be called Queenslanders. We honour her as our monarch, and I know that I speak on behalf of my electorate when I extend our congratulations to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on her Golden Jubilee. We sincerely thank Her Majesty for her commitment and dedication, despite difficult times. We wish her much happiness as she continues to reign as the Queen of the Commonwealth and our Queen of Australia. Debate (on motion by Mr Neville) adjourned.
