Prime Minister, I desire to put before the Treasurer an offer made by the Vaucluse Trust to place at the disposal of the Commonwealth the historic and valuable building known as Vaucluse 'House, at Watson's Bay, Sydney, for the purposes of a permanent war museum.

If we are ever to reach a temporary end, we shall have to proceed with business a little more speedily. The best answer I can give the honourable member is that the Bill will be introduced as soon as possible. Getting behind that rather ambiguous observation, I think that one may say that, unless there is a general desire on the part of honourable members to get through the business within a reasonable time, we cannot justify our existence as a Parliament. what I am, I were an ordinary citizen outside Parliament, I should say so, and pretty flatly, too. Talk about the fable of the hare and the tortoise! Why, Parliament is at best progressing sideways, and I think it is about time it took a move forward.

Five lionorable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. -'Despit e the little pleasantry by the Prime Ministeri n regard to wasting the time of thc House with a motion for adjournment, I make no apology for calling attention to what I consider a matter of very gravo importance indeed. announcing the policy of the Country party, on the 10th March last, I saidAnd, above all, there must be a return to parliamentary control of the public purse. The war, thank God, is over, and the earlier this Parliament returns to the traditions of responsible government, the better it will be for the country and the easier for the Ministry. All expenditure of any magnitude should be authorised by this House, and reasonable opportunity should be afforded for its proper consideration. Parliament must immediately resume absolute control of the public purse. Parliament has the right to protest against matters of such vital importance as this purchase of certain saw-mills in Queensland being notified in the public press before being made known to it while it is in session. Apart from that, a very grave principle is involved. A l though Parliament is in session, it finds itself committed to an expenditure of about £500,000 without-having had any State Declaraopportunity of expressing an opinion on the matter. I do not propose at this stage to enter into the merits or demerits of the purchase; but, if this Commonwealth is to embark on a policy of State Socialism, it should be done directly and We should not have what the Acting Leader of the House( Sir Joseph Cook), when sitting in Opposition, described a3 "" this pernicious system of sneaking (Formal).

The Prime Minister has adopted the f a i r and straightforward attitude of j u s t if ying the purchase.

34,Sir Joseph Cook,"Oh, yes.Minister in charge deliberately stressed the limitation that was imposed. An amending Bill, which has been carried through another place, adds that same limitation to section 14, which deals with the delegation of powers by the Commissioner, because there might be some doubt as to whether the restriction applies to delegated powers. The Commissioner did not delegate his power in regard to this particular purchase; he dealt with it himself. amending BillI intend to submit other proposals, which will establish further Treasury control. the best advices I have been able to get, the Government have full and complete control over all expenditure of amounts in excess of £5,000. It is a well-known legal axiom that no one can delegate powers greater than those he possesses. If the Commissioner has no power to expend more than £5,000 without the approval of the Minister, most assuredly he cannot delegate such power. contention, but has the Commissioner the power ? ably, he has not the power. The Minister who introduced the Bill distinctly said .so; and section 16 of the Act is defianother letter, dated 20th August, 1920, nite upon that point the Minister said; read what the Act provides. of section 16 provided that, before exercising any power under that section which involves the expenditure of more than £5,000, the Commissioner shall submit his proposal for the approval of the Minister. that section confer? delegation does not arise in this matter at all. extent-that the Senate has already conclusively that the suggestion which passed a Bill to include a new section, has now been made by the Treasurer ( Sir which will remove any doubt which may Joseph Cook), that the Queensland purexist as to whether the Commissioner is chases were carried out by the Commisable to delegate power in respect of exsioner without tbe knowledge of the Gopenditure in excess of £5,000. entitled to say that it is against the spirit of the section. titled also to say that this project was referred to Cabinet before the actual purchases were made. I can show that the matter of the purchase of saw-mills has been under the consideration of the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. Millen) for twelve months. I have had some correspondence sent me to-day dealing with the purchase of another timber mill. I propose to read a letter from Mr F. E.

MrM c WILLIAMS very serious matter that a man, after having placed a plant under offer to the Department, and having been told that, before any purchase was made, his offer would be considered, should learn-with out any further official intimation or, in deed, without knowledge from any source -that the whole proposition has been completed. complaint is that there has not been a f u l l and free selection, and that certain parties, who sought to place properties under offer, have been excluded? MrM c WILLIAMS deavouring to put the whole case f u l l y before the House. I think I have established that Cabinet has considered and has had . the project in hand for a considerable time. MrM c WILLIAMS that the Government take f u l l and complete responsibility for the deal. so, anyhow. MrM c WILLIAMS a similar character had been launched when honourable members who are now in Opposition, were in power; if they had bought £500,000 worth of saw-mills with the intention of running them as a State Socialistic concern, honourable members now behind the Government would have risen in wrath and protested. We have had two or three of these State deals without the consent of Parliament. One of themI am bound to say-ha s turned out an exceedingly good proposition. I refer to the purchase of the Strath line of steamers by the Prime Minister( MrN o ; I have never Hughes), when he was in London. U n doubtedly, that venture has proved a really good commercial undertaking. But there have been some other State ventures inaugurated under similar circumT h e n if the prostances-that is, by the Cabinet solely, and without the approval of Parliament -whic h certainly'have not been successful. For instance, there was the purchase of the Shaw wireless plant. That was made a Cabinet matter, and was undertaken without the sanction of Parliament. Then there was another project which, although it did not prove so disastrous politically, has been very much more serious from the financial aspect. I I think it is a refer to contracts entered into for the building of certain wooden ships-. ber is not suggesting that the test of this kind of thing turns upon the question of success or failure? MrM c WILLIAMS I am not. I am purposely avoiding such a line of argument, although a great deal could be said in regard to that phase; and I might The honourable member's add that certain information has come to hand, by the use of which I could throw an interesting light upon certain specific Commonwealth business ventures. However, when I perused the statement of the I am enMinisterf or Repatriation, which was read to the House by the Prime Minister, it recalled to my mind boyhood days in the Huon country. I remember that a man came into the timber country to make certain very large purchases of timber supplies. He did splendid business. He bought tens of thousands of palings, and And , therefore, hundreds of thousands of shingles "" in the round "" ; and he paid a deposit. He did not discover what was meant by the phrase "" in the round "" until he went out into the bush to look for his timber. If a proposal of Then he learned that "" in the round "" meant growing trees. Some of the figures proffered by the Prime Minister reminded me very much of that deal. the honourable member's interpretation of the phrase is not technically correct. "" In the round "" means when the timber is cut. MrM c WILLIAMS I am not prepared to accept t h a t ; and, in any case, the timber was sold as I have described the deal.

The Lahey Brothers are amongst the hardest-headed business men in Queensland. Do the Government mean to suggest that, as an outcome of those men selling their plant to the Federal authorities, the output of the mills will be increased ? No one will say that men who know the game from A to Z cannot get a greater production than an inexperienced Government. l""-have lived in timber country for the best years of my life. I have never known one big company to make money out of sawmilling in Tasmania. MrM c WILLIAMS have never known one big company which has made money out of saw-milling in that State. Of course, the saw-mills during the past two years or so have been .011 a far better basis owing to the fact that there have been no importations of American timber, as a result of which prices in Australia have risen by more than 200 per cent. which we want to put a stop to. MrM c WILLIAMS is concerned, the Prime Minister remarked, in effect, that the State mills are profiteering also-if there is any profiteering at all-because , he said, one cannot buy timber more cheaply from the State mills than from private mills. A6 for the wooden ships venture, that contract was entered into without the approval of Parliament, and it has cost us more than £500 000. Then there is also the wooden shipbuilding venture in which the firm of Kidman and Mayoh were concerned. with this business ? MrM c WILLIAMS taking which wa6 entered into in just the same circumstances; that is to say, without the knowledge or consent of Parliament. has to accept his individual responsibility for the deal, as a supporter of the Government, along with his fellow members behind the Treasury benches. illustration is that every other country in the world has made similar losses. Some have lost ten times as much money, during the war, upon this same kind of thing. MrM c WILLIAMS If any country in the world has made a worse deal than Australia over' its wooden ship contracts haye done so, and have done f a r worse. MrM c WILLIAMS I intend, despite opposition, to make use of the figures representing the loss in connection w i th the Kidman and Mayoh contract, in regard to which class of deal the Treasurer, and the Prime Minister, say that other countries have done much worse. The Government entered into a contract with that firm for the construction of six ships. The building of four was cancelled, at a I have; and small ones too. cost of £52,000. The other two ships were I repeat that I built, and were sold privately. Johnson) -Order! W ill the honourable inember say how he proposes to connect this matter with the motion? should not forget that the Americans made a loss at the rate of £13 per ton on their wooden vessels, as against our loss, which works out at £5 a ton. MrM c WILLIAMS I want the S o far as that House to decide whether the functions of Parliament are to be vested in the Executive, or to remain with Parliament itself. I want honourable members to say, now, whether they are prepared to allow any Minister, or any official under that M in ister, to commit Parliament and the count r y to any enterprise he may select, and to any extent he may choose; and then, for honorahle members to be told that it is useless to say anything, seeing that the deal is closed, and is a good bargain. A f t e r all of which, when the proposition proves to be a rotten bargain-as some It is an underof these ventures have been-ther e is no course open to honourable members but to stand aside and watch the country pay and look pleasant. I want the House to And the honourable member express an opinion now. We cannot stop this latest deal. It has been completed, no matter what the ultimate cost is likely to be. If the Government were to be compelled to retire to-morrow, it would be for those who succeeded it to carry out the terms of the contract.

I am not should limit the amount in that transaction? that, for the transaction is completed. ber's remedy, if the Government do anything wrong, is to censure the Governmember for Franklin talks of Socialistic enterprise.

The honourable member, under cover of his motion, has delivered a lecture about what the House ought to do, and, in particular, what the Government ought to do. The honourable member has been a member of this House for many years, and his attitude towards various transactions has been coloured by what may be termed his political prospects from time to time. We are not, therefore, to take his observations this morning too seriously. What, in effect, the honourable member says is that nothing wil l ever be well with this country until he is at the head of the Government. Singularly enough, we have a gentleman who was returned to this House by virtue of his rather vehement and hysterical denunciations of the sin of gentlemen on the other sidei-member s of the official Labour party-declarin g that the only hope for this country is a sort of collaboration . between himself and an honourable member whom D r .

We know he ing, particularly loud and continuous is not concerned about the country at all. interjections. He rises from time to time with a view of creating the impression that he is the ters aside, let us come down to the gravafountain of wisdom and knowledge. On men of the honourable member's charge. the sugar question, he says that years He says that a basic principle has been ago he foresaw everything that has taken set aside; that is to say, the basic prinplace, and that the Government foolishly ciple of the power of Parliament over the rejected his advice, which would have public purse. I am amongst the first to saved the situation. His advice was to buy sugar ahead; but how were we to do that? A f t e r consulting Parliament? No ; he said it was to be done without consulting Parliament. Now he stands up in his place, and becomes most eloquent about the right of Parliament to control the public purse, and speaks of the soldier, and the difficulties of housing him. The other day he desired a morahas torium in order to prevent soldiers being ejected from their homes. But when it is proposed to erect houses for the soldiers, the honourable member says that we are doing it in the wrong way-that we are flouting the fundamental principle of responsible government. I say these things in order to show that the honourable member's real motive is not disclosed by his observations, and that his criticisms of the actions of the Government must be taken for what they are worth. Let us look at the saw-milling transaction on its merits-whic h the honourable member failed to do for a moment. It is, perhaps, the greatest tribute to the wisdom of the deal that the honourable gentleman was unable to say that, taken ' on its merits, it was a bad one. presently! ber only realizes, as he w ill in the course of years, how little he counts in the scheme of things, he w ill not make interjections of that kind.

89,Mr Hughes,"P u t t in g all those matrecognise tliat the principle upon whicli responsible government rests is that the responsibility sliall lie where the power is, and that the power ancl the responsibility shall go hand in hand. Tho honourable members says that, clearly, the functions of Parliament include power over the purse. I admit that; but the functions of Parliament also include the power of legislation, and, under the power of legislation, Parliament may delegate any or all of its powers to a Commissioner, or to Commissioners, to a Minister, or to anybody it thinks fit. In doing that, Parliament docs not derogate from that authority with which it is vested. The honourable member may not be aware of the fact that, by -section 5 of tbe ""War Service Homes -Vet 191S, Parliament deliberately delegated its authority to the Commissioner. Thut section isThe Commissioner shall be a body corporate by the name of the War Service Homes Commissioner, and shall have perpetual succession and a common seal, and be capable of suing and being sued, and shall, subject to this Act, have whatever action it may choose to employ. power to acquire, purchase, sell, lease and hold lands, tenements, hereditaments, goods, chattels, and any other property for the purposes of Government to be carried out without tin; tliis Act. It. is clear, then, that power is deliberately given to the Commissioner for a specific purpose. What is that purpose? Everybody knows that Parliament cannot of itself do this business. Every day Parliament, declares its incapacity for dealing with matters of business, and delegates them to specific bodies and persons. Tho repatriation and rehabilitation of our soldiers is one of the first duties of the Oommonwealth, ancl is, perhaps, the primary obligation resting on the shoulders of its citizens, but it is not merely u question of at some time housing them; we must house thein quickly and effectively. If it is said that the Commissioner is corrupt or incompetent, then Parliament has its remedy. He must be removed from his office But it is not said that he is either incompetent or corrupt. I want honourable members to look at the Act in the light iu which the Government interpreted it. We came to the conclusion that the Commissioner had this power. We may have made a mistake; but if Ave have done so it is a mistake the Crown Law authorities have also made. [185]2 of the Aet. lawyer, to set my opinion against that of a layman in the interpretation of the law. At any rate, that is the conclusion to which we came-w e may have been wrong -bu t whether we have been right or wrong in the matter of the expenditure of large sums of money, I admit freely that, any doubt ought to be resolved in favour of the opinion expressed in the House this morning, namely, that thedecision should lie with Parliament. However, the Government's, action in the matter was quite bond fide.: the Commissioner carried out the deal and entered into this contract. True, the actual contract has not yet been signed, but I should think it is certainly one upon which the other parties to it could sue for any breach. However, as it is not yet signed, Parliament has a remedy, subject, of course, to any consequences that might follow upon It is impossible for all the multifarious duties resting upon the shoulders of a aid of experts, who, for all practical purposes,* are business advisers. Every day when sugar is offering on the market, we are obliged to make purchases which, in the aggregate, cover a far greater amount than is covered by the transaction under review tliis morning, in order to guard the Commonwealth against a shortage. Is it contended that thc Government ought to come clown to this House every time and ask, "" May we buy this cargo of sugar?"" It would be impossible to do so. However, that cloes uot mean that that course could not have been pursued in this transaction. Sir 'ROBERT BEST -Hear, hear! Thut is the point. matter quite fairly. We must differentiate between classes of transactions, and on a fair interpretation of the Act it may be said that the Commissioner had the power to make this particular contract. At any rate, the Government construed the Act in that way. We may have made a mistake. If so, we must avoid making mistakes of that kind in the future.

Sir [32.5] -My right honourable friend, the Prime Minister, is certainly at all times very entertaining and interesting, but during the greater portion of his speech he did not deal with what was relevant to the matter raised by the honourable member principle involved in the transaction which the honourable member has brought under the notice of tlie House. I wish to associate myself with those who protest against the completion of a transaction of this character without consulting the House and securing its confirmation. The Prime Minister seeks to show by the Aet itself that the Commissoner had the right to make this contract, and, technically, this seems to be the case; but the spirit of the Act is demonstrated by a study of section 16, which stipulates that thfi approval of the Minister must be obtained for any land transaction involving the expenditure of over £5,000. That means that some control must be exercised over the Commissioner. Certainly it was never contemplated that a vast deal, involving ttni country in an expenditure of £500,000, could be carried out without the consent of Parliament first being obtained. It was not so inserted in the Act, as Parliament relied on the unwritten law and practice for its protection. regret that the Prinie Minister has seen fit to introduce the question of honourable members being in favour of, or against, the erection of War Service Homes, which has no connection whateverwith the principle the House has been invited to discuss. We passed the War Service Homes measure unanimously, and we are all anxious that the work of building soldiers' homes should proceed with the utmost expedition. Buti f the Government thought it was desirable that this transaction should be entered upon for the purpose of building these homes speedily, tlie Prime Minister could readily-as he himself admits-hav e come have one to Parliament and first sought its approval and confirmation on the merits of the deal. He admits the principle for which I am contending, which I hope honourable members generally will scrupulously and assiduously conserve and jealously guard, namely, the power and control of this branch of the Legislature at least over the public purse. It is true principle had to be brushed aside, and government for the time being became government by the Executive, and not by Parliament-ther e was much to be said in favour of that method of administration; indeed, it was necessary, because of the emergencies that arose from the dislocated conditions brought about by the war-bu t for the' past eighteen months, since the war ceased, we have been struggling to secure a return to parliamentary government. My right honourable friend has been so accustomed to act on his own responsibility, and has become so imbued with the idea of undertaking transactions such as this in a light and airy way that he has failed in his duty to consult Parliament on this matter. it. My only responsibility lies in the f act that a Minister authorized the deal. principle that the Commissioner, although he may have had a technical right to do so, had a substantial right to deal with this matter. Everybody realizes the basic principle to which the Prime Minister has referred, namely, Che control of the public purse. under the interpretation of the Act, the I Commissioner and the Minister had not ample power to deal with this matter Parliament has given them that power. technically, the Commissioner had the power to carry out such a transaction; but, as he consulted the Minister, and sought his approval, and lie in turn no doubt obtained the consent of Cabinet, I contend that Cabinet ought to have consulted Parliament in regard to this purchase. The right honourable gentleman has very properly discriminated between various transactions, and, of course, the duties of government must be carried on; but he has given away the whole case by saying that, in",28,Adjournment Purchase Of Saw Mills And Timber Areas In Queensland

Sir Treasurer) [12.19] I propose to deal briefly with the constitutional aspect of this matter. The honourable member for Kooyong (Si r Robert Best), who has just resumed his seat, correctly states the principles of responsible government when he says that Parliament intends that, in regard to all these important transactions, it should have the final voice and the final responsibility. safeguards with which Parliament has surrounded itself by means of the Public Works Committee, which it has authorized to inquire into works involving an expenditure of over £25,000. All that he says as to that is true. I merely suggest that the Public Works Committee Act does not apply to this particular transaction. ' Works Committee Act relates to expenditures which are initiated by a Minister. to the principle laid down in the Act. Sir JOSEPH COOK And I am pointing out that that principle was never intended to apply to a transaction of this kind. We passed a special Act relating to War Service Homes. W h y was it thought necessary to pass that special Act, creating the Commissioner, and clothing hi m w i th f u l l authority, if we already had the necessary safeguards and machinery ? We deliberately took the Commissioner of War Service Homes out of the category to which those safeguards apply. The Parliament, in effect, said to him , under the Act, "" Get along w i th this work of yours.""

This House has told him to do so. It has given h i m millions of money with which to build them, and hns snid to h i m . "" B n P d them at the rate of 7.000 or 8,000 houses a year if you can."" How could he build houses on that scale if he could not expend more than £5,000 on material at any one time? D r . EARLE PAGE -This transaction relates, not to the buying of material, but member w ill recognise that it is quite impossible that the Public Works Committee Act could be intended to apply to transactions of this magnitude and on this scale. The point I am stressing is that the usual safeguards relating to ordinary Government contracts do not apply to a particular and unique case of this He refers to the kind. If they d i d it would not have been necessary to pass the War Service Homes Actf o r this special purpose. anything of this sort being attempted when the B ill was before us. the Commissioner is clearly beyond question. The question of whether it was wise to enter into a transaction like this before submitting it to the House is a matter which must be determined by the circumstances of the case. Here are the circumstances as set out in a report made by the Commissioner, to the Minister, on 6th May lastI t has been very evident for some time past that it is impossible to secure supplies of timber at anything like reasonable rates for the erection of War Service Homes. This is largely owing to the operations of timber combines who control prices, and who meet monthly, and each meeting for the past six months has produced a further rise in the price of timber. The Government Departments in Queensland and Western Australia have not been any more reasonable than the merchants. Owing to tlie enormous quantities of timber required (80,000,000 super, feet per annum), and to insure continuity of operations at reasonable cost all over Australia, and especially in New South Wales and Victoria, the only policy left to the War Service Homes forest areas to meet its own demands, thus insuring supplies at reasonable cost, and allowing thereby the general public to have their original sources of supply for public requirements uninterfered with. The scheme for timber supplies has been developed as the result of very careful and The Commissioner is building exhaustively conducted investigations in all States with timber merchants, timber merchants' associations, and State Government Departments, over a period of several months coupled with a careful investigation of the position in America and the Old World. Unless the requirements of the Commission are protected at this stage in regard to timber, I gravely doubt the success of the War Serviee Homes Commission.

Onlyi n that belief was the transaction undertaken. I very much regret that the papers relating to this matter have not been laid upon the table. I am not blaming the Minister, because he has assured me that some of the papers are in Sydney, and that he has made every effort to get them here in time. But it is a matter for regret that we are not able to consult the files so that we might be able to discuss in more detail the merits of ' the purchase.

If there is a repetition of that sort of conduct, I will do my best tQ remove him from office as speedily as possible. w ill have to behave himself in this chamber. We have had too much of that sort of thing from him. He must not proceed further in creating grave sectarian differences in the House, and insinuating charges of disloyalty against who dare do anything in opposition to him. While the war was on it was essential that the Government should take grave responsibilities on many occasions without consulting Parliament. ] They did many things that were r i g h t : on the other hand, they made many mistakes, as they were bound to do. We are prepared to forgive the errors that were committed under the abnormal circumstances existing during the war time, but now that the war is over the members of the Country party are pledged to do tbeir utmost to restore constitutional methods and parliamentary control of the purse. We made that promise to our constituents, and are determined to enforce it, no matter what the cost. Probably the Government were technically within their rights in' authorizing this purchase, notI know that withstanding that the Act states specifically that not more than £5,000 can be expended by the Commissioner without the consent of the Minister. The Minister has given his permission in connection with this transaction, so that, technically, the Act has been observed, but the purpose for which it was passed was to enable the Commissioner to build homes, not to enter into a trading concern. Undoubtedly there has been a grave straining of the meaning of the Act. It is true that a lawyer might say that technically the Government nad the power to do this thing, but it was never intended by Parliament for a single moment that the Commissioner should commit the country to a purchase involving a very large sum of money, and a new policy involving vast commercial and trading concerns. Let us assume that the Commissioner and the M in ister had justification for the transaction. The Commissioner has to build an enormous number of homes for soldiers, and he has experienced a difficulty in getting material for that purpose. He desires to build them at a reasonable price. Every honourable member has a similar desire, for we do not want the buildings to cost £200 or He £300 more than they should. The Commissioner says that the business people who control timber supplies have in creased tiheir prices so much that he cannot pay them and erect the houses at a reasonable cost. He has, therefore, those bought a number of old saw-mills. By so doing, he has not given the community one extra foot of timber.

172,Mr Charlton,"I rise upon apersonal explanation. cheon adjournment I understand that the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton), by way ,of privilege, made some remarks in reference to an observation made by me to him prior to the conclusion of the division then being taken. I desire, first of all, to .tender to that honourable member, and to the House, an apology for making that observation. I had no right to make it . I think I ought, in justice to myself, to explain why I did make it-no t by way of justification for making it , but m explanation. Hunter, on Thursday, I think, speaking on behalf of the organization with which he is so closely associated, told me that it was vital that the Industrial PeaceB ill should be passed into law at the earliest possible moment. He gave me very good reasons why that should be done. I explained to him the position 1 of public business, and said that I would do everything in my power to pass the B ill into law this week. That being the case, and. as I had listed the Senate's amendments in the Industrial PeaceB ill for to-day, I naturally felt considerably annoyed at the honourable member voting for a motion which would have the effect of preventing my doing what he had asked me to do. I feel called upon to make this explanation, which, as the honourable member understands quite well, is in accordance wibh: the facts, in justice to myself; but, as I have said, this does not in any way lessen, nor is it to be taken as extenuating, what I did. That, I admit quite frankly, was most improper; and I ask the honourable member to accept my apology. fay that I accept the Prime Minister's apology.

Mr Knibbs has informed me by letter, however, that it would be difficult to obtain information in this way as to the wageearning capacity of each household, since people would not be disposed to make known their financial position to the collectors of cards. which to obtain a reliable wealth census is by means of letter returns directed to the Department.

This is a B ill to r a t if y an agreement made between the Commonwealth and Mr Basil Murray, managing director of the Westralian FarmersL t d . It is proper to state, at the outset, that the farmers of Western Australia have made great strides in the direction of co-operation, and have set an example which I hope will be followed by farmers in every State. Their organization is conducted on business lines, and comprises a very large proportion of the farmers of the State. The possibilities of the development of Western Australia are almost illimitable. Amongst other things, it is a great wheat producing State. It s potentialities in that direction are almost infinite. The farmers of Western Australia recognise But that is over a series that if they are to hold their own in the normal years that are to come, they must T he honourable member be prepared to land their wheat in the markets of the world at reasonable rates. Before interviewing Mr To that end, they realize that all unnecessary expense must be eliminated. They are men of progressive ideas, and they recognise that the present practice of bagging wheat is uneconomic. The present high price of jute imposes a very serious handicap on the producer. Various suggestions have been made to the CommonThe wealth that it should make arrangements with the jute merchants for the purchase of jute, and distribute it amongst the farmers. I should like to point out, however, that whatever the Commonwealth might do, it could have no possible control of the world's price of jute. The added cost of the production of wheat, as a result of bagging, must be very considerable, and in the future will, I think, be still more considerable. One of the phenomena of which I spoke last evening as being the aftermath of the war, is that the workers in Eastern countries are demanding The only way in higher wages. That, together with the depreciation of money, means that jute goods will continue to be high in price. The Western Australian farmers, therefore, have decided to adopt bulk handling. That involves the erection of silos for storage and terminal elevators for loading wheat into vessels. Incidentally, it also' involves structural alterations in wheat-carrying vessels. farmers of Western Australia decided to I for m a company for this particular purpose, and their representative approached the Commonwealth Government and asked for its co-operation. The Commonwealth Government was returned upon a policy of assisting by every possible means co-operative effort amongst the farmers. It , therefore, welcomed this proposal of the Western Australian farmers, and looked upon it from its in ception with friendly eye. Negotiations were carried on for some considerable time between myself and Mr Basil Murray, to whom I wish to pay my t r i bute of recognition as an up to date business man who has the interests of the farmers at heart.

The estimated cost of the scheme ie £800,000, of which £ 2 5 0 000 is to be provided by the farmers, and £550,000 is to be loaned by the Commonwealth. The period of the loan is twenty years. loan is 6 per cent., or such higher rate, if any, as the Commonwealth may pay on the loan from which the advance or any instalment thereof is made. That is to eay, whatever we pay they pay. object of the company is, as I have said, to erect and operate silos and terminal elevators for the handling of grain in bulk in Western Australia. The company is not to traffic in grain, but to act only as operators of silos and elevators. The shareholders of the com,pany are the farmers who own the grain, but the company dose not traffic in g r a in ; it merely yearly spent in Western Australia alone.. handles it and operates the silos and elevators. It is provided in the agreement that the companyshall receive and deal with grain from nonshareholders of thc company upon the -same terms and conditions as it receives and deals with grain from shareholders. Therefore, this company is not a close corporation designed to erect silos and elevators mainly for the benefit of its own shareholders. It offers the same privileges to every farmer. The engineers employed by the company to design and supervise the erection of silos and elevators are to be approved by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth is advancing £550 000 of its own money, and it is of importance, therefore, that the desien shall be satisfactory, since these silos and elevators will be the security for our monev. 1 wish to direct the attention of the House to the fact that the company, as an earnest of its bona fides, is to soend £100 000 of its own money before it receives any from us. I commend that to co-operative eflFort throughout the Commonwealth, and, in passing I desire to The points outstanding besay, once and for a l l , that what we are prepared to do for Western Australia we are prepared to do for every State on these terms. There is here an earnest of the bona fides of these farmers that should appeal to every man. They are prepared to back the venture with their own money. It would be a bright day for this Commonwealth if , The agreement in every State, the producers, not merely of wheat, but of other products tliat lend themselves to co-operative effort, would take similar action. The 'Commonwealth is prepared to encourage the producer, who in turn must show that he not merely desires to lean against the Commonwealth, but is preThe interest on the pared to stand on his own feet, and stake his own money. The security to be held by the Commonwealth is an important consideration, because we are the guardians of the people's money. The comThe pany is to deliver to the Commonwealth first mortgages and other securities over its assets, real and personal, including uncalled capital. To briefly recapitulate the advantages that w i ll accrue from the scheme: There w ill be the saving of expenditure of many thousands of pounds per annum on the purchase of cornsacks, upon which approximately £200,000 is Those figures w ill carry conviction to every farmer -throughout Australia. on the present high value of jute goods. that there is little prospect of the jute market falling , owing, firstly, to the appreciation of money, and, secondly, to the fact that labour in Eastern countries is demanding higher wages, whioh will mean increased <'.ost of production. I do not know that we need regard the -latter fact, as an unmixed calamity; it has its good and its bad sides. The second advantage w ill be the prevention of deterioration and loss of grain, such as are caused by mice, weevils, &c. That is important, becnuse through those factors the Wheat Pool lost very many hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of grain. ' The third advantage w ill be the saving of unnecessary handling, ancl consequent waste. There will be facilities for prompt handling, both at the railway siding and at the ship's side.

Under the bulk-handling scheme, Australia will be in a better position lo compete in the world's markets than under the old system of .bagging. construction of grain silos and elevators in New South Wales was carried out entirely at the Government's expense, the money being advanced to the State Government by the Commonwealth Treasury. In Western Australia the fanners -are contributing £250,000, approximately one-third of the cost of the scheme. The silos and elevators in that State are to be controlled and worked by private enterprise, and not by the Government. commend the B i ll to the House, and hope there will be little delay in its adoption. My only regret is that I am not in a position to bring before the House a similar agreement for each State. hope that the farmers of Australia -will realize the tremendous advantages that are conferred by bulk handling, and recognise that the arguments used against the system are mostly adduced by interested persons, who handle jute goods, or in some other way have an axe to grind. Bulk handling has come to stay; already ihe Commonwealth has invested millions of pounds in it . I hone that' before long I shall have the privilege of introducing other measures of this character. Mr 1'UNTON -What will be the value of the security to be held by the Commonwealth? money is to be spent in the erection of silos and elevators, over which the .Commonwealth Government will have a first mortgage. Before we spend one penny, the farmers must spend £100,000. Thereafter the expenditure w ill be in the same proportion as the contributions to the total cost of the scheme; that is to say, of all expenditure after the first £100,000 the farmers will provide one-third and the Commonwealth two-thirds. We shall be lending on a 66 per cent, margin, which, I think, in an ordinary transaction, any hanker would regard as a sound business proposition. A t any rate, the security is quite good enough for the Commonwealth, and I recommend the scheme to the House. adjourned.
