I told him yesterday that I had forwarded his request, and the following reply came yesterday evening:(a) Eighty-three contacts have been detained at the station since the commencement of the epidemic. [i) The Health Department of New South Wales state that it is impossible to state what persons have and have not been contacts, and; therefore, it is impossible to say what proportion of contacts has not been isolated. orable member for BendigoI ask the Minister <ef Trade and Customs whether he has been able to obtain the information which the honourable member desired a few days ago ?

Mr P. P. ABBOTT -I s the Postmaster-General aware that telephone in stallations in the country districts of New South Wales are in arrears from eighteen months to two years, and that under the existing arrangement a great many of these works may not be constructed during the next twelve months? W ill he endeavour to devise some means whereby the whole of the work in connection w it h applications for country telephones can be brought right up to date, and, if necessary, a larger trust f u nd set aside whereby the works can be undertaken quite apart from those which are mentioned in the Estimates each year? has been causing me considerable concern lately. I have been reflecting as to the best means of getting over the difficulty. While coming in this morning, or perhaps going home last night, it occurred to me that the simplest plan to adopt-as I am afraid the Department cannot overtake the arrears-woul d be to call for tenders for as many lines as possible, and thus see if we can get over the difficulty in that way. ask the Postmaster-General a question. The matter is Some time ago a thriving mining town called Rosebery, in Tasmania, applied to the Department for a telephone at the hospital. The people are scattered a b it in that country, and through the interminable red tape of the Department in Hobart for the Postmaster-General to send a chaser over and "" rouse her up "" ?

Isi t possible to bring the postal -management of Tweed Heads under the control of the Deputy Postmaster-General at Brisbane? some time that the present system of working a large State from one centre demands too much from the Deputy Postmaster-General. I think that these officers have too much detailed work to do, and are tied up in their offices. What is in my mind, if I have an opportunity of doing it , is to cut up Australia into districts and to give the postmasters in each district more power and more responsibility, and if you like, to have a supervisor in each State. The postmaster at a place like A l b u r y , for instance, would manage that district, and so at BrokenH ill and other places. t it is possible for one man to manage the whole of the postal business of Queensland or New South Wales.",14,Deputy Postmasters General Re Arrangement Of Duties Appoint

Yesterday, I drew attention to some hundreds of names having been objected to in one subdivision of Cook, and wish to ask the Attorney-General whether the Returning Officer for the district has to personally institute an inquiry into every case, whether it is possible for him to do t h a t with such a large number of cases to be inquired into?

67,Mr Speaker,"The honourable memanother question in connection with electoral matters, and arising out of his previous answer ready pointed out that it is contrary to the practice of Parliament as recorded by recognised authorities to permit answers given by Ministers to questions to be debated, and although a further question is permissible to make clearer a reply already given, a practice is growing up here of practically raising a debate oh ah answer to a question by a series of further questions arising out of the answer already given, and upon subsequent answers. This practice is irregular, and should be discontinued. sir, will you kindly state, for the information of the House, what is the object of a question? Is not the privilege which honourable members have of addressing to Ministers questions concerning matters of public importance granted with the object of enabling information to be obtained, and are not honourable members justified in putting questions until they obtain the information for which they ask? Is not an honourable member entitled to obtain a f u l l reply to a question put by him to a Minister? member is asking two questions. Dealing first of all with the second question put to me-whethe r an honourable member is entitled to obtain a f u l l answer to any question he may ask a Minister, I would say that that is a matter entirely at the discretion of the Minister to whom the question is addressed. As a matter of fact, a Minister is not bound to answer any question put to him without notice. It is entirely within his own discretion whether he shall do so or not. As to the first part of the question which the honourable member, on a point of order, has addressed to me, he desires to obtain certain information, and I have before me a number of extracts from various authorities on parliamentary procedure dealing with the subject-matter of his inquiry. He asked for guidance in regard to the asking of questions, and I would refer him to page 249 of the 11th edition of May, where it is stated thatThe purpose of a question, is to obtain information, and not to supply it to the House. A question may not contain statements of facts, unless they be necessary to make the question inwish to be clear whether it is really the telligible and can be authenticated; nor should a question contain arguments, inferences, imputations, epithets, or controversial or ironical expressions. Nor may a question refer to debates or answers to questions in the current session. Discussion in anticipation upon an order of the day or other matter, by means of a question, is not permitted; nor can a question be asked regarding proceedings in a Committee which have not been placed before the House by a report from the Committee. A question which publishes the names of persons, or statements not strictly necessary to render the question intelligible, will be refused a place on the notice paper. The expression of an opinion cannot be sought for by a question, nor the solution of an, abstract legal case, or of a hypothetical proposition. Nor is it in order to ask merely whether certain things, such as statements made in a newspaper, are true; but attention may be drawn to such statements if the member who put the question makes himself responsible for their accuracy. No question can be asked which reflects on the character or conduct of those persons whose conduct, as stated on page 278, can only be dealt with on a substantive motion; and for the same reason a question is not permitted which makes or implies charges of a personal character. Nor can any question be asked regarding character or conduct, except of persons in their official or public capacity. A question also which might prejudice a pending trial should not be asked. This statement generally covers rulings and practice governing the asking of questions. Mr J. H .

This is not a new matter. I moved in this direction in 1910, and on that occasion the Minister of Trade and Customs of the day, the honourable member for Yarra, after a lengthy discussion on the motion, promised me that if it was withdrawn he would gather all the information he could concerning the subject and let me have it .

A t present, when we have an unfortunate visitation in the shape of some disease or pest, the Inter-State trade is thrown into a state of chaos. The producer does not know whether his produce will be received on the market for which it is intended, while the merchant is doubtful about how or when to buy, or to otherwise regulate his business. indefiniteness and confusion; and it therefore seems to me that if Federal officers were used instead of the State officers, much uncertainty and undesirable anti-Federal feeling would avoided. Produce is now inspected at the port of shipment, and also at the port of entry; and, if in the State of the port of entry there has been a good season for the particular produce shipped, and picion arises that the inspection laws are being used for some ulterior purpose, such as 'reserving the local market for the local produce. member was a State Righter? tion of State rights, because all the powers that I suggest should be exercised are given to the Commonwealth under the Constitution.

Commonwealth, however, ought to have sufficient power to guarantee the producer that, when sound stuff is placed on the wharfs, it will be permitted to go on the market.

W it h the exception of the State of Queensland, the counting of votes goes on at these polling places in all the States, and at places sometimes much smaller than is suggested in the motion. It is manifest that in Western Australia and in New South Wales, in which States the Labour party have been in power, the great bulk of the members of the Labour party in those States are not dissatisfied with the counting of votes in these small places;, or they would have amended the electoral law, especially when they had in f r o n t of them the example of the Federal Labour party.

On a question like this surely honourable members will exercise theircommon sense; surely party government is. not to "" rule the roost.""

I know Y o u are telling a delibethat it is true, as pointed out by the mover, that there is great dissatisfaction in many small centres in country districts by reason of the fact t h a t votes which are cast there are hot counted there, and that consequently it is not known by those who voted what tlie result of the poll at I withdraw and apolotheir particular polling place was.. I will undertake to say tliat if the opinions of the people who had voted at any small centre were canvassed, the resultwould be unanimously in favour of having the votes counted at those centres. There is hardly an individual who votes at a small centre who would not say, . "" We want to know the result of the poll at our I object to that. centre."" An election is a burning, quesI t is. disorderly for tion with them, and they want to know how their district voted. They cannot know under the present system. The contention of honourable members opposite that the counting of the votes at these small centres is open to objection, because pressure can be brought tobear upon individuals, is one that has no substance in it . The honourable member for Maranoa has quoted instances of pressure' which has been brought to bear by land-owners or squatters upon their employees. In my opinion, the day has passed when pressure can be brought to bear in that way, even if land-owners were disposed to exert it . Honourable members opposite are casting a reflection upon, and aTe slandering, both working men and landowners in making such an observation'. They are practically accusing working men of being crawlers, and not men at all.

Colonel RYRIE 1 hope they will not, for the honourable member's own sake. StillI withdraw the expressions. I say in all seriousness that it is a reflection in country districts to know tlie strength upon working men to say that they can be coerced into voting as their employers wish. It is also a grave reflection upon hundreds of land-owners to say that they would endeavour to coerce their employees. ber's argument is really in favour of open voting. Colonel RYRIE -No, I am strongly in favour of preserving absolutely the secrecy of the ballot, and I contend that if the result of a poll taken at small censecrecy of the ballot, I give the motion my tres were known, it would in no way infringe, the secrecy of the ballot. Honourable members know that there may be a polling place at which only forty votes are' cast. Of these six may be given to one candidate. Probably every one of the forty voters will, claim to have voted for the candidate who received only six votes. I remember that when I was a much younger man, I contested an election. There were twenty votes at one polling place. Only one was given to me, and the other nineteen were given to iny opponent. But when the election was over, sixteen of those people came to me, and each one said separately that he was the man who gave me the one vote. crawlers. Colonel RYRIE -Yes, they were; they voted foi the Labour man. I say that this motion does not in any way interfere with the secrecy of the ballot. a scrutineer at every polling place. Colonel RYRIE I had a scrutineer at every polling booth in my electorate, honourable and the honourable member can do the same. He has any number of well-meaning enthusiasts in his constituency who would act .for him. I am strongly in favour of the motion. IfI thought that carrying, this motion into effect would interfere with the secrecy of the ballot in any way, I would not give it my support. But I do support it for several good reasons. The first, is fchat it is really a matter of some value of political feeling at particular places. It is of great importance to candidates and political organizations, as well as to fche public generally, to have an idea of the political identity of localities. It is really in the interests of country districts that the votes cast at particular polling places should be counted separately. It is advantageous to be able to locate interests and support given by various localities to the great parties in politics.

I venture to say that if the electors in country districts were circularized on the subject, the lot boxes. I have seen some offchenew result would be almost unanimously in favour of the motion.

If there should be a risk of any such evasion, I suggesb tofchemover that he should delete the words relating to counting, and .let us apply what he desires simply to the declaration.

In my opinion, we should not .alter the provision in the elecdraw his motion, or postpone it. I shall' toral law. When the first Electoral Bill was under discussion, our friends from Queensland told us of the great corruption that had taken place there in State elections in the old days, it being known how every one was voting, and we were pressed to provide for the counting of votes at head-quarters. Eden-Monaro was Whip to the Governsolid. ment of the day. many good metalled roads in my division, sent to an adjournment, ifc will be imposthere are many roads which are not sible for him to get a division before 1 metalled, and which get into a very bad o'clock, because there are several memstate in wet weather, but, notwithstandbers wlio wish to speak. Were the motion; ing the rain that fell before the holding of the last; election, no difficulty was experienced in bringing in the various balboxes, and think them splendid for their purpose; it being impossible to interfere with their contents when they have been locked. I do not agree with those who say that every one who goes into a polling booth is prepared to announce exactly how he is voting, and that it does not the polling booths or not. I think it would be very dangerous to do the counting at the polling booths. Our friends opposite frequently speak of the danger that voters would run if it could be found out by land-owners and squatters how they had voted, but I think that the voters would be iu a worse position if fchey had to incur the risk of it being found out byfcheLabour organizations how they had voted. On a Queensland station it. was assumed that the manager, the bookkeeper, and the storekeeper will vote for the Liberal side and the men for the Labour side. If the ballot boxes were emptied, and the votes counted at thestations, it might be found that-some of the men had voted for the Liberal party, and that would cause trouble. I do not think that any man would be game tovote for the Liberal party if there were a chance of the Australian Workers Union finding it out. Liberal voters would* (Corangamite) probably be subjected to persecution under such circumstances. I hope that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro will withhave to vote against it . I suggest to the lionorable member forEden-Monaro that, as his own side is divided in regard to the motion, and theMinistry opposed to it , he would do well to. withdraw it .",29,Chapman Bu T I T Does

[65] surer) [2.4] -In presenting the last 1912, the Treasurer announced that, in order to meet his expenditure during the (Bass) [ 1 2 . 5 6 ] I financial year 1912-13, it would be necessary to expend, nofc only the revenue Instead, however, of this surplus of £2,261,673 being required to supplement the revenue of the year, the revenue exceeded the expenditure by £391,550, the accumulated surplus on the 30th June, I desire to move1913, amounting to £2,653,223. In the Budget-papers, it appears on page 69, under the head of Trust FundInvalid and Old-age Pensions Account ... £1,950,79 0 Naval Defence Account 702,433 £2,653,223 An explanation of the surplus is also given on page 7. The reason of this large surplus being l e f t at the end of the year was that the revenue received was in excess of fche estimate by £1,477,413, and that the expenditure was less than theestimate by £1,175,678. Adding to was an addition to the surplus of 1911-12, disclosed when the accounts for that year suspended from 1 p.m. lo 2 p.m. were finally made up, the total accumulated surplus on the 30th June last It is, therefore, clear how the credit by, the Treasurer receiving £1,477,41 3 more than was anticipated, and expending £1,175,678 less than was estimated. This amount of £2,653,223 accumulated out of the revenue of 1910-11, 1911-12, aud 1912-13, and is available for expenditure this year, 1913-14. Of this amount, however, only £195,450 was held in cash on 30th June, 1913. . The balance of £2,457,773 was in vested to the extent of £1,310,000 as part of investments of £3,448,015 of General Trust Funds, and the amount of",32,Grant To Tasmania

For various 2,000 1,167 reasons, I came to the conclusion that it 37,000 39,907 was reasonable to expect during the pre45,792 sent year some reduction of Customs and Excise Revenue. Already this important . 96 source of income shows a tendency to de48,000 42,006 cline, as the receipts to the 30th September show a falling off of £ 2 2 8 , 5 6 3, as compared with those of the previous year, 3,000 2,921 but as a sum of about £158,000 is outstanding in respect of Sugar Excise, the -24,456 falling off is only really about £ 7 0 , 5 6 3 . On the other hand, I expect a considerable increase, say, £325,000, in Post Office revenue. The total estimated revenue for the current year, as I have shown, amounts to £21,462,000, which, added to the surplus of £2,653,223, makes the total amount available for this year's expenditure £24,115,223.

To this is to be added the accumulated surplus which was, on the 30th June, in Trust Fund for expenditure in future years, viz., £2,653,223. Adding these, we have for expenditure the total amount of £24,115,223. The estimates of expenditure, it w ill be noticed, absorb the whole of the estimated revenue available.

The balance of the total estimated expenditure 1S13-14, viz., £24,115,223, including that for all the other Departments of the Commonwealth, absorbs £2,718,992. These five items make us realize the rapidity of our advance in expenditure. In 1909-10, on tliese five items the expenditure was £14,908,395 . Proposed Loan Bill -Ifc has, however, nofc been possible to include in the ordinary Estimates of Expenditure provision for the following services, viz.: Land required for Defence purposes ... £300,000 Land required for Postal and Telegraph purposes Conduits and laying wires underground Machinery, machine shops, and wharfs, Cockatoo Island, New South Wales Erection of London Offices Railway, Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railwayi n Northern Territory, Pine Creek to Katherine River and southwards Railway from Port Moresby to Astrolabe, and for construction of wharfs, Port Moresby and Samarai, Papua ... 60,000 £3,080,000 It has been accordingly determined to provide for these items in a LoanB ill . I do not think that Parliament will take exception to this course, as the works are of a permanent character, and such as are properly chargeable to loan. W it h regard to the purchase of machinery for dock at Cockatoo Island, honourable members are aware that the transfer from the State of New South Wales to the Commonwealth was arranged by the late Government. The arrangement made was that the total cost of the property, viz., Land valued at ... ... £110,175 Docks ... ... ... 350,000 Workshops and machinery, &c ... 407,541 £867,716 should be treated as if it were transferred property under clause 85 of the Constitut i o n ; that .is, it would be treated as a debt to the States, on which interest would be paid.

Defence -The total expenditure provided for Defence for the current year, including Construction of Fleet, is £5,746,853, as compared with the expenditure of £4,079,590 in 1911-12, and £4,331,498 in 1912-13. £166,600 was expended for Naval Subsidy, which item does not appear in 1913-14. ' In this comparison I have included £300,000 for purchase of land, and £175,000 for purchase of machinery, A c , Cockatoo Island, to be provided from loan.

U p to 30th June last, the College has cost £150,352 for building, and £80,871 for general expenses, In all, therefore, including this year's estimated expenditure, the total w ill be £313,023. There are at present 112 cadets resident at the College, and it is anticipated that thirty-eight more will be admitted during this year, thereby completing the establishment of 150. estimated cost for this year of each cadet is about £ 3 9 3 . The reports and balance-sheets of the Cordite, Clothing, and Harness Factories for the period ended 30th June, 1912, were recently presented to Parliament. The total expenditure for land, buildings, machinery, and plant for the Cordite Factory to the 30th June last, was £95,330. It has also cost in maintenance £42,126, which is represented by value of material in stock and finished. A t 30th June, 1913, the number of staff and employees at the Factory numbered ninety. U p to the present, only cordite for small-arms ammunition (.303) is being manufactured, and the Factory has proved, to"" be capable of turning out sufficient to meet the annual requirements of the Royal Australian Navy and the Commonwealth Military Forces. intended to establish the machinery for big-gun cordite as soon as possible. The cost to 30th June last for lands, buildings, machinery, and plant for the Small Arms Factory was £170,377. There has also been expended for maintenance £102,239, a total of £272,616. The total number of persons enaged at tlie factory at 30th June, 1913, was 295. Several thousand sets of parts have been completed, but, so far-30t h June, 1913only forty finished rifles, and 2,250,000 steel chargers have been manufactured. Jfc is expected that 5,000 rifles and 3,000,000 steel chargers w ill be made during the year. The estimated expenThe instructors, diture this year is £87,000. The total cost to 30th June last for land, buildings, machinery, and plant for the Clothing Factory was £22,080. The expense of maintenance to that date was £24,423, which is represented by value of material in stock and finished. This factory is now capable of supplying the whole of the clothing required for the Naval and Military Forces, and also, if necessary, the greater part of the requirements of the Postmaster-General's Department. The total number of employees, including the staff, was, at 30th June, 1913, 595, and the value of the output for the year ended 30th June, 1913, was £135,122. I am informed that the quality and cost of the articles manufactured are satisfactory. TheI n regard to the Harness, Saddlery, and Accoutrements Factory, the total cost to 30th June last for land and buildings, machinery, and plant was £11,146. The cost of maintenance to that date has been £16,682, which is represented by materials in stock and finished. The bulk of the harness, saddlery, -leather, and canvas equipment required for the Defence and Postmaster-General's Departments is now being supplied from this source. A t 30th June, 1913, a tofal of 170 employees, including staff, was engaged, and the value of the output for the year 1912-13 was £49,443 . For the Woollen Cloth Factory, £85,000 is provided on the Estimates for buildings, also £5,800 for maintenance. A site for the factory has been acquired at Geelong, Victoria, a manager appointed, and arrangements are in progress for the erection of buildings and the purI t is chase of machinery and plant, for all of which provision is made on the Estimates.

The annual estimated cost of the dockyard is £30,000. The cost to date of the Boys Training Ship has been £61,582, £15,000 for purchase of the Tivgira. About300 boys have been entered to date. The vote for maintenance of the Royal Naval College, Geelong, is £24,100. The total number of cadet midshipmen will be brought up on 1st January next to fiftysix, so that the annual expense of each cadet is £430 .

There has already been expended (up to 30th June, 1913), £78,220, at Westernport, and £14,611 at Cockburn Sound. Provision is made on the present Estimates for £215,721 for the above purpose, though it is estimated that only £165,721 will be expended within the year. The Fleet unit has already cost £3,860,000. £300,000 is provided this year, and a further amount of £102,266 will be required to complete the work The particulars are as follow: and pay for it , the total estimated cost being £4,262,266. Coming now to the question of the Strength. establishment of the Australian Navy, the proposal of the then Government as comis 1 nin g 1 -a n municated by myself as Treasurer to this House on the 1st December, 1909, was H eo o H to provide a naval unit consisting of one armoured cruiser, three unarmoured 202 3,186 3.448 202 3,145 3,347 cruisers, six destroyers, and three submarines; and it was arranged with the 23 98 126 28 98 126 Imperial Government to co-operate with two other similar units-on e on the China 22 654 676 and the other on the East India Station 29 3,610 3,639 -to be supplied by the Imperial Govern376 8,213 8,589 281 7,507 7,788 ment, and which together would form the r -. i Eastern Fleet of the Empire. The cost of the Commonwealth unit was to be £3,695,000. It is now estimated that the Commonwealth proportion of the fleet will cost £4,262,266. The Commonwealth has been active in providing its unit on practically the above basis; but, for some reason or other, of which the present Government is unincluding aware, two units of similar strength on the China and East India stations have not as yet been provided. This important matter is now the subject of correspondence with the Imperial Government, and a conference has been requested, with a view of deciding upon a further increase of construction, in conjunction with the Mother Country and fche other portions of the Empire. Telephone Revenue at about 13^ per The total revenue received in 1911-12 £3,916,254, and in 1912-13 £4,224,916, showing an increase of 7.9 per cent. The estimate for 1913-14 is £4,548,000, showing an estimated increase of 7.6 per cent. If we examine the expenditure figures we find a much greater rate of increase. Not taking into account New ""Works and Buildings, the expenditure in 1911-12 was £4,330,896, and 1912-13 £4,783,744, the rate of increase being 10.4 per cent. The estimated expenditure for 1913-14 is £5,189,265, the estimated rate of increase being S.4 per cent. If we add to this expenditure of £5,189,265 the amount proposed to be expended from revenue on New Works and Buildings, £1,350,113, and the amount of £595,000, which it is proposed to obtain from Loan Eund, also £15,897, the balance of the Special Vote of £600,000, we have the immense sum of £7,150,275 to be expended this year, as compared with a total of £6,284,053 expended last year-a n increase of £866,222, or nearly 14 per cent. This vast expenditure shows, I think, the wisdom of the Government in proposing to appoint three Commissioners to conduct the affairs of this large trading concern. I hope no time will be lost in obtaining parliamentary authority for making this great reform. The increase of business, the increased rates of pay, the higher cost of material, and the higher costs of contracts for mail services are the chief factors bringing about this large increased expenditure. It has been found necessary to provide to proceed with the erection of eight for the following increases for this year, others in New South Wales (Randwick, viz.:Increase to provide full year's salary for staff provided on Estimates 1912-13 Statutory increments Increased cost of Conveyance of Mails owing to increased price of labour, horses, fodder, &c, and also owing to additional services being granted 46,930 'Increased .' non-official postmasters 16,690 These four items amount to £313,481 so that of a total increase in the ordinary business, and four are partly completed, expenditure for 1913-14, as compared but not yet open for business. with 1912-13, viz., £479,224, the amount of £313,481 may be looked upon as au unavoidable increase. But, as the business of the Department is rapidly extending, it has been found necessary to provide an additional new staff, numbering 2,606 officers, at a cost of £125,328. To enable full benefit to be taken of the wireless stations, an increase of £17,680 has been provided. Then there is an increase of £22,986 for repairs and maintenance of Telegraph and Telephone lines, also £6,879 for increase of Telegraph and Telephone instruments. As regards New Works, the following table shows the expenditure for 1911-12 and 1912-13 and the estimated expenditure for 1913-14: POST AND TELEGRAPH-NE W WORKS. From"" Prom Special From Year.

Altogether £97,206 was expended up to 30th June last on allowances to wireless construction. Twelve stations have been completed and opened for business. Three have been partly completed and been opened for Tasmania: Additional Grant -The Government propose to increase the special payment to Tasmania, under clause 96 of the Constitution, by £400,000, making the total payment £900,000, as unanimously recommended by the Royal Commission, and a Bill will at once be submitted to Parliament for the purpose. The proposed method of paying this additional £400,000 is by paying £5,000 this year, and increasing the amount by £10,000 every year for eight years, and for the ninth year paying £80,000, thus:1913-14 1914-15 1915-16 1916-17 * .. 1917-18 A .? .. 45,000 1918-19 1919-20 1920-21 1921-22 .. 80,000 £400,000 Tasmania has had a hard financial struggle under Federation, and is deserving of the fullest consideration. Personally, I have much pleasure in making this announcement on behalf of the Government. Pubic Debts -The public debt of Australia (Commonwealth and States) on 30th June, 1913, was £301,903,435. Of this large amount, £206,054,787 was floated in London, and £95,848,648 in Australia. It is a remarkable fact that during the last thirteen years tlie increase of the public debt floated in London ""has been only £32,821,894, while the increase floated in Australia has been £73,854,135-showin g that during that time only 30 per cent, of the loan money was obtained out of Australia. While this, on the face of it , looks satisfactory, it would seem, however, to imply that there is a great tendency to invest in Government securities rather than in industrial enterprises. On 30th June, 1900, only 11 per cent, of the public debt was floated in Australia, while on the 30th June, 1913, quite 32 per cent, was so held. I think that the opportunities for enterprise in Australia are not availed of to the extent it would be desirable, and this, I think, has its root in the fact that there is a good deal of friction in industrial enterprise, which is very regrettable and injurious. This, I think, is one of the causes, and perhaps the principal ono, why the savings of the people have, during the last twelve years, gone into Government securities rather than into enterprising developmental works.

Provision will be made for the Commonwealth to borrow for the States, if requested to do so, but there will be no restriction on the States borrowing for themselves. A sinking fund of h per cent., vested in trustees, for the redemption of the debts will be provided. The Bill will be a very simple, and not in any way complicated, measure, and should, I think, meet with approval. There will be no financial complications between the Commonwealth and the States, as the interest and sinking fund will be provided from the surplus revenue paid to the States. Iu the case of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and Western Australia, the annual contribution of 25s. per capita by the Commonwealth will always be more than sufficient to meet the interest and sinking fund required on their respective loans; while in the case of South Australia and Tasmaniai t will be sufficient up to the years 1940 and 1922 respectively, and after those years there will be only a small deficiency. During 1912-13, the pended loan moneys enormous extent: New South Wales Victoria Queensland ... South Australia Western Australia Tasmania Total Taxation -It is not proposed to .resort to any fresh taxation, or to place, any in creased burdens on the people. The Tariff question has been remitted to the Inter-State Commission, .and it is not considered advisable to deal with it t ill , it reports on the matter; ,and there has not been time to consider other financial matters that require consideration. During the Federation period, both Commonwealth and State taxation have increased considerably, both in actual amount and also in amount per capita. For the financial year 1901-2, the first complete financial year under Federation, the Commonwealth receipts from taxation aggregated £8,900,000, as compared with a total of £16,100,000 for the year 1911-12. Similarly, the .aggregate of State taxation amounted to £2,700,000 in 1901-2; totalled £5,400,000 in 1911-12. The total increase in Commonwealth and State taxation combined has thus in creased from £11,600,000 in 1901-2, to £21,500,000 in 1911-12. The corresponding amounts of taxation per head of population (through Customs and Excise) were £ 2 5s. 6d. in 1901-2, £ 3 4s. 5d. in 1911-12, and £ 3 5s. 8d. in 1912-13, an increase of 44 per cent, in eleven years. The entrance of the Commonwealth Parliament into the arena of land taxation, which heretofore was reserved for the States, has raised difficulties not previously anticipated, owing to there-being now three separate authorities enforcing taxation on the same land-the three valuations of the same land are all dissimilar, and general dissatisfaction is the result. A t the present time, the same land is valued and taxed for municipal, for State, and for Commonwealth purposes by three separate authorities, and the cost of valuation is three times what it should be. various States exA n effort will'be made to enter into an to the following arrangement with the States so as to arrive at a uniform system of land values assess... £8,691,897 ment for all State and Commonwealth . . . . 2,728,088 purposes, and thus save a great waste of ... 2,448,065 time and money. ... 2,626,847 The estimated amount of revenue for ... 3,409,218 1913-14 from this tax is £1,400,000, and 378,088 it is paid by about 14,000 persons. ... £20,282,203 'The machinery of this taxation measure makes its operation' exacting, and, personally, I hope it may be possible to amend it so as to, at any rate, repeal the company and leasehold aggregations, which, though increasing the revenue, are very troublesome and difficult, as well as unnecessary. It is not possible to do anything this year for obvious practical reasons. Besides which, the largeoiSicrease of revenue during the last three years has resulted in immense expenditure and commitments that have to be met. The taxation' of the people of Australia is increasing, and is now, for Commonwealth, State, and local, £ 5 12s. 6d. per head, as against £ 4 2s. 2d. in 1909, made up as follows: 1909. 1912.

Northern Territory A very difficult problem presents itself as to the best way of making the Northern Territory of the Commonwealth self-supporting and settling a permanent white population there. A large Government establishment is in existence, and the total estimated cost this year, with Oodnadatta railway, is £721,556, but, as yet, nothing has been done in the direction of making the count r y productive or in settling people on the land. As far as I could gather, only seven settlers had actually gone to their holdings, and seven others were on their way. Practically very little work has been done as yet. In addition to the amount of £721,556, loan authorization for £400,000 will be asked for the construction of a railway in the Northern Territory, from Pine Creek to Katherine River and southwards, the ultimate object in view being to connect by railway with Oodnadatta in South Australia, and with Camoowealin Queensland. Without means of transit, it i's impossible to do anything, and the construction of these railways must be proceeded with. Trial surveys for these railways are in progress, and plans and reports w ill soon be in hand. The NortheprioCBerritory and the Port Augusta-Oodnadatta ready cost the Commonwealth £7,868,995 , made up as follows: South Australian loans taken over and now outstanding State loans redeemed fey Commonwealth loans up to 30/6/14 ... Further loan, Oodnadatta railway Loan authorization, 19131914 Paid from revenue up to 30/6/14 £8,282,736 Less Sinking Fund £8,228,011 Less revenue Northern Territory up to 30/6/14 ... £7,868,995 This immense obligation renders it imperative that early means of a practical character should be taken to make the Northern Territory wealth-producing. Commissioners are now engaged investigating the requirements and possibilities of the country, and have been urged to send in reports as soon as possible. The Government f u l l y realize the pressing importance of this matter. Immigration -The immigration policy of the Government is the same as the policy of the Liberal party has always been. We intend to co-operate with the Statesi n selecting suitable immigrants, and encouraging them to our shores, the aim being to so divide the task as to enable the Commonwealth to control the matter up to the landing in Australia, while the States assumethe responsibility after landing, by finding suitable employment and settling them on the land. In order to largely increase settlement and produce wealth, and to become a strong and self-contained people, it is necessary to greatly increase our numbers and add to the defenders of our country. Last year, £19,904 was expended in advertising the resources of the Commonwealth.

If the proposed amendment of the Notes Act becomes law, by which/ a gold reserve of 25 per cent, up to £7,000,000 and £ l for £ 1 afterwards w ill be always -held by tbe Treasury, there will .always be a fixed sum of £5,250,000 available fop investment in Commonwealth securities. Of this £2,990,002 has already been appropriated, and a LoanB ill will be submitted this session which will absorb the remainder. On the 30th of June last there had been received from the sale of notes £9,163,517 in gold, and after deducting all expenses, the interest on' tlie investments amounted to £301,742. this, interest is being earned by investments of other Trust Funds at the annual rate of £122,200. last the Treasury held 3,732,557 sovereigns, being 40 per cent, of the note circulati'. n. If our proposals had been in force on the 30th of June last, the gold in the Treasury would have beenOne-fourth up to £7,000,000 £1,750,000 £ 1 for £ 1 above £7,000,000 2,163,517 Total reserve of gold ... £3,913,517 Gold actually held ... 3,732,557 Additional gold proposed £180,960 Loan Flotation -It may be asked, How Total. are we going to obtain our loan moneys? It is intended that the loan moneys required shall be found by making invest£ £ ments of the Australian Notes Fund and 11,665 22,233 33,898 the General Trust Fundi n Commonwealth 29,458 68,450 97,908 Inscribed Stock. The late Government loaned to the 150,352 231,224 States and banks £5,720,000, viz., £3,130,000 frbm the Notes Fund for long 49,000 32,800 81,800 periods maturing from 1919 to 1926, and 129,872 5.183,152 313,024 £2,590,000 for shorter periods, maturing between 17th September, 1913, and 30th September, 1914, and, in addition, lent further sums to the States amounting to £1,310,000 from the General Trust Fund. It seems to me that it would have been wiser, in view of the demands on the Trust Funds for the purpose of these funds, and also for the railways and other works to be charged to loans obtained from these funds, if ithe investments had been, for shorter periods. I hope, however, that it may be possible to arrange funds for the necessary expenditure as it arises during the year without going on the loan market. The Budget-papers will explain all these transactions. Banks and Savings Banks -'The growth of the business of Savings Banksi n Australia during the past twelve years has been phenomenal. On the 30th June, 1901, the number of depositors totalled 965,000, but by .the 31st March, 1913, the number had grown to 1,896,000, an increase of nearly 100 per cent, in the twelve years. During the same period Besides the total amount on deposit in Savings Banks grew from £31,000,000 to £73,000,000, an increase of about 140 On the 30th of June per cent., while the average per depositor increased from £ 3 2 to £ 3 8 10s., and the average per head of population of the Commonwealth increasedfrom £ 8 3s. to £ 15 6s. positors per 1,000 of population was 255, as compared with 397 in 1913. The growth of business of cheque-paying banks during the twelve years has also been very great. creased from £91,000,000 in the June quarter of 1901, to £152,000,000 in the March quarter of 1913, the current accounts having grown from £37,000,000 to £65,000,000, and the fixed deposits from £54,000,000 to £87,000,000, during that period. Similarly, the advances have grown from £94,000,000 in 1901 to £121,000,000 in 1913, and the banks' holdings in coin and bullion from £20,000,000 in 1901 to £29,000,000 in 1913, notwithstanding the gold withdrawn from the banks for the Australian Notes gold reserve. The Government have not yet been able to do anything in the direction of preventing the duplication of the Savings Banks throughout the Commonwealth, and the consequent large, unnecessary, and wasteful expenditure. in the opinion of the Government, no necessity for the Commonwealth to enter into competition with the Savings Banks of the States, which were beneficent and going concerns, whose operations greatly assisted the agricultural development of the Commonwealth. It is proposed to consult the State Governments with a view of placing the Savings Bank on a basis which will prevent duplication, and, at the same time, meet the requirement! of the people. On the 30th June last the deposits in the Commonwealth Savings Bank amounted to £2,693,971, of which £820,441 belonged to Tasmania. Of this £2,693,971, a sum of £1,945,367 was in . £27,133. Old-age and Invalid Pensions and Maternity Allowances -It is proposed to amend the Old-age PensionsA c t so as to provide that, when a pensioner enters a benevolent asylum, he shall do so as a free man, and as a ""paying guest,"" and any surplus above what is charged by the institution will belong to himself, and this will also apply to an inmate of a benevolent asylum who becomes a pensioner while in the asylum. This will, it is thought, be conl a 1901 the number of desidered a valuable provision, and will have the effect of making more happy and comfortable the aged pensioners of the Commonwealth in the evening of their days. It will, however, increase the old age pensions expenditure by probably The deposits have in £140,000 per annum. I think, however, that this proposal is both logical and fair, and I have pleasure in introducing and recommending it for tlie favorable consideration of honourable members. On 30th June, 191 3, there were 82,943 old-age pensioners and 13,739 invalid pensioners, and 82,556 maternity allowances had been paid. The'total amount paid for these three classes during 1912-13 was £2,701,828, and the estimated expenditure this year is £3,270,000. In regard to the maternity allowance, it is not proposed to attempt an amendment this session. The estimated payment during this year is £650,000. The Government is of opinion that the maternity allowance should be only given to those in need, and that the whole comThere was, munity should not be taxed to give money to those who can very well pay for themselves. There is no doubt that this maternity allowance cannot continue to be paid for very long, and that a system of social insurance must soon take its place. A system is under consideration which, it is believed, may secure all that is needed, on a contributory principle, by which the allowance could continue to be paid from the Consolidated Revenue for a short time to all contributors, subsequent benefits being drawn from the Social Insurance Funds. By this means those who do not"" need the allowance would be eliminated. The Government are most anxious to help those who are in need of the allowance, but are opposed to those who do not vested, the interest accruing being require it being a burden on the taxpayers. Railways The Commonwealth has embarked on railway construction, and the railway to connect Western and Eastern Australia is in progress, and, it is hoped, will be pushed forward with rapidity. Up to 30th June, 1913, a sum of £606,985 had been expended on this work. Provision has already been made by loan authorization for £1,000,000, and a further loan authorization for £1,400,000 will be submitted at once. Papua -You will also be asked to authorize £60,000 being expended from loan funds on a railway from Port Moresby to Astrolabe, and for the construction of wharfs at Port Moresby and Samarai, in Papua. It is proposed to provide the £60,000 as a loan to Papua. It is believed that this railway will greatly assist agricultural development, as well as the copper mines which exist in the district to be served. By the 30th June, 1914, the Commonwealth will have made grants to Papua (including £78,125 for this year and the proposed loan of £60,000 for railway purposes) of £455,436. The estimated revenue of Papua for this year is £45,598, and of this sum £32,000 is raised from Customs duties. F u l l particulars will be found on page 88 of the Budget-papers. London Office -The foundation stone of the new offices in the Strand was laid by His Majesty the K in g on the 24th July last. The land and building are estimated to cost £726,500. Antarctic Expedition Provision is made ou the Estimates for the sum of trade is British, and 33.96 foreign in £5,000 as a grant towards the f u n d now origin. As to the exports from the Combeing raised for the purpose of bringing monwealth, the proportion is: back Dr. Mawson's expedition from the Antarctic. Despite the rigours and discomforts of the Antarctic Continent, Dr. Mawson and his devoted band have been carrying on their scientific investigations with a zeal and energy that demand our most cordial! admiration' and substantial recognition. Trade and Commerce -Let me deal now with the trade and commerce of the country The followiug table shows the value of imports into the Commonwealth, 1912:From United Kingdom £45,925,156 From British possessions 9,581,206 Total ...

The Sugar IndustryI come now to what has always been a rather difficult question, namely, that of the sugar industry. sugar in Australia for this year is estimated at about 260,000 tons. estimated production for this year is 226,991 tons, as compared with the production for last year of only 130,059. The amount of bounty paid last year was £370,306. last year, after paying bounty, was £839,770, while for this year the net revenue w ill be only £397,000, a loss of revenue owing to the abolition of Excise and bounty on 25th July, 1913, of £442,770. employed in the industry, including in factories, on 31st December, 1907, was 41,800, while on the 31st December, 1912, it was only 27,380. 1907, there were employed in the industry, including factories, 4,068 coloured persons, while on 31st December, 1912, there were only 1,383. duced in 1907 was 214,244 tons, while in 1912 it was 130,059 tons, and estimated tor this year 226,991 tons. cember, 1912, it appears that there were 14,420 fewer white men employed in fche industry than in 1907, five years previously. ployed in the industry, including in factories, were: 31st December, 1906 ... 33,700 31st December, 1907 41,800 horti31st December, 1908 38,190 and viti31st December, 1909 36,619 ... ... £8,791,982 31st, December, 1910 34,120 31st December, i.911 29,776 ... ... 40,633,602 31sfc December, 1912 27,380 specie, orable member know that the 1912 season ... 22,746,379 was a bad one ? ... 558,354 am dealing now with the number of white 975,713 men employed. when there is nothing to do. presett 144,891 acres under sugar-cane and beet, and there were employed on was 31st December, 1912, 27,380 white persons, and 1,383 coloured, so that 95 per 1912, was cent, of those employed in the industry are white. The sugar industry is suited to our is .a very creditable northern lands, and must continue to be assisted in every way possible. Efforts must be made to induce its cultivation in the Northern Territory. This, I am certain, is the wish, as well as the duty, The consumption of of every one. So long as our production of sugar does not exceed our consumpThe tion we can, by the barrier of Protection, secure the Home market by taking the burden on ourselves; but, so soon as our production exceeds our requirements, which is now imminent, we shall have to The net revenue from sugar enter into competition with the production of sugar by the cheap coloured la/bour of the tropical world-labourer s accustomed to another civilization altogether. Herein is our position and our difficulty, in regard not only to sugar, but to many The number of white men other industries. It is difficult to suggest a remedy. Two suggest themselves to me. The first of these is that we should fill up our country with people On 31st December, who will be both producers and consumers, while the other is to continue to avail ourselves of the most up-to-date appliances so a3 to insure economical proThe sugar production.

Agricultural Dairying,Ate -During per annum, and, if it is maintained, the the past twelve years agriculture has population of Australia w ill double itself made satisfactory progress, the total in about thirty-six years. The rates of area under crop having increased from increase per annum of England and Wales 8,400,000 acres in 1901 to 13,000,000 are 1 per cent.; Germany, 1J per cent.; acres in 1912. 1912 was 92,000,000 bushels, a yield and Canada, 2J per cent. for Australia which has only once been exceeded, viz., in 1910, when a inclusive, the total number of births in total of 95,000,000 bushels was obtained. Australia was 1,329,000, and the total Large as it appears in itself, Australia's number of deaths 555,000. This gives a wheat yield is only about 2 per cent, of gain in population by natural increase of the world's production of this cereal. For the past ten seasons, Australia's The payments have been as average wheat yield has ranged between 8J bushels per acre in 1907, and 13f bushels in 1909, and has averaged 11J .. £88,860 bushels over the whole period. . . 17,940 During the past twelve years the num£106,800 ber of horses in Australia increased by 800,000, namely, from 1,600,000 in 1900 to 2,400,000 in 1912. In the same 2,414 period the number of cattle increased by 8,600 3,000,000, viz., from 8,600,000 to 11,600,000, while the number of sheep .. £39,688 increased by 13,000,000, viz., from .. 4,052 70,600,000 to 83,600,000.

A feature of the growth of population iu Australia during the past twenty years has been the tendency to become more and more Australian-born. Thus at the census of 1891 the Australian-born represented 68 per cent, of the total population; at the census of 1901 they represented 77 per cent.; while at that of 1911 they represented 82.33 per cent, of the total. Conclusion This Government came into office only a week before the expiration of the financial year. I u the last three years, during which the Liberals had been out of office, the annual expenditure of the Commonwealth increased from £8,155,666, in 1909-10, to £15,387,933 in 1912-13, the increase being £7,232,267. The result of the termination of the Braddon clause, and the substitution of a contribution of 25s. per capita to the States, during the three financial years 1910-11, 1911-12, and 1912-13, was that £14,190,095 more of the Customs and Excise revenue was retained by the Commonwealth. If we add to this the land tax revenue, in the present instance the press was furwhich for the same three financial years amounted to £4,152,676, we have the enormous sum of £18,342,771 received by our predecessors (the Labour Government) which would not have been received if the Braddon clause had continued, and there had been no Federal land tax imposed. The £18,342,771 of extra revenue naturally encouraged a vastly increased expenditure thafc could not have been possible, or even thought of, otherwise, and, consequently, large expenditure has taken place from revenue, which would have been impossible under the conditions existing for the previous nine years of Federation. The Government do not intend to interfere with the expenditure to whicli the country is committed. We intend to administer the affairs of the Commonwealth on safe and economical lines, doing justice fco all, and showing favouritism to none. We will do our best to restore public confidence, to stimulate enterprise, and give security to the whole people. "" I have performed my task."" I have tried to place the financial position of the Commonwealth before honourable members, and "" a round, unvarnished tale deliver."" Treasurers come and go, but millions of Australians will be here when we have all gone "" to the undiscovered country."" If we seek to do our duty, our aim and object must be to act faithfully as trustees of a great inheritance, to be singleminded and patriotic, strenuously labouring for the present and for future generations. I move That the first item in the Estimates, under Division i-The Parliament-namely , The President, ;£i,roo, be agreed to. have to congratulate the Treasurer on his Budget effort. I am sure he will pardon me when I suggest that, if he has the honour to deliver another Budget speech, he will not fail in that courtesy which has been invariable since this Parliament was instituted. I mean that I hope he will not fail to supply at least the Leader of the Opposition with a copy of the speech he proposes to read. In every other instance of tlie delivery of a Budget speech that has been done; but nished with absolute copies, while I could not, by request, obtain one for myself. an absolute copy. the Opposition, when Treasurer, ever supply absolute copies? unexpected possession of member. it done. around copies of the manuscript. honourable gentleman is making a mistake. ber is quite wrong. Now that I have mentioned this matter, I may as well say that during my term of office the Leader of the Opposition never came into the House without previously being supplied with copies of the Bills to be introduced.",51,Reserves

271,Mr Eisher,"The honourable memThese are little courtesies which have been overlooked in this Parliament, and I think they might well be continued, whoever represents the various parties. As I say, I congratulate the Treasurer on his effort, and particularly on his peroration. We have been told that the Government are here to do their best to restore confidence, and, no doubt, they are conscious of the fact that not only the Ministry, but the party, need the confidence of the country. The Treasurer, by his Budget, proposes to expend over £5,000,000 more than was expended by.the previous Government. The present Government came back from the country to initiate economy, restore the public finances to a proper condition, reduce taxation, and to clean up the maladministration of the late Government; but, true to Liberal instincts and the Liberal policy, their first Budget runs the country into debt. When the first Fisher Government came into power they were met with a deficit left oy the late Liberal Government, and whoever succeeds the present Government will undoubtedly also have to meet a deficit. and not hundreds of thousands! already. Happily, the Treasurer is in possession of £2,600,000 odd left as a surplus, which he proposes to use, in adsurer regardingfcheinvestment of the Ausdition to a .sum of nearly double that amount, for the purpose of carrying on this year's expenditure. able member regret that the present Government came in with a surplus? cause we secured a surplus purposely; we conserved the public finances in every instance. Hume ought to know that, in addition to that surplus, there is £340,000 odd earned, in the Australian Notes Trust Fund, making practically £3,000,000 of accumulated surplus left by the previous Government, which, as I say, began with a deficit. During our three years of office we expended in works, out of the annual revenue, a sum of £9,227,286, or, practically, £10,000,000, in addition fco the £3,000,000 we left as a surplus The Treasurer points out that the late Government had over £15,000,000 more during their three years of office than the previous Liberal Government had in the three years prior to 1910. rect. in tbe sense in which the Treasurer puts it, because, if the honourable member for Hume knows anything of the finances, he must know that in 1910 no old-age pensions were paid, and that the party at present in power, when they succeeded the Fusion, passed a Loan Act for the purpose of raising £3,500,000 to pay for the Fleet, whereas the Labour Government paid for it out of revenue. The mere fact tliat £700,000 odd was not paid during the financial year was because of the delay in the construction of the ships. BeforeI left office, I asked the permanent, officials to pay every penny that could be paid, and my successor, the present Treasurer, undoubtedly did the very same thing. This' was not an occasion when Treasurers were trying to keep back accounts; but, on the contrary, they were desirous to get every account in and to meet it. There was no lingering debt left to the present Government. I am sorry that the Treasurer has left the Chamber without waiting for a reply to his statements, but 1 must say that he either wilfully or ignorantly misled the House in at least one financial matter. I challenged tlie Treatralian Notes Fund, and the General Trust Fund, and he emphasized and reiterated the statement that the investment of these two funds was long-dated and that the money would nofc be soon available.

Comparisons of that kind must, in any ca3e, be detrimental to AusO n page 68 of the tralia. I congratulate the Treasurer on his determination to pay £5,000 this year towards the grant to Tasmania.

The present Government are going to supplement the remainder, and are meeting their difficulties with for t i tude by paying £5,000 this year, and an Treasurer is £4,440,000, plus additional increasing sum each successive year, so that, if they existas a Government for the next ten or twelve years, they will make a substantial contribution to that f u n d .

Let me again express my thanks to the Treasurer for the manner in which he has delivered his Budget. he felt proud when he was dealing, not with millions, but with tens of millions. I when he spoke about being able to spend this money in the defence of the country, and that money in the development of this great continent. It is true that he is going to do it on money that he has not collected himself; he is going to do it in the same handsome way he has always done it-o n money borrowed from others, or accumulated during the period of office of another Government. But giving all that in , I congratulate the Treasurer on his effort, and I join with the right honourable gentleman in wishing for the welfare of the people of Australia, the prosperity of this great country, and its development on sound lines, and in the hope that every person who honestly gives his labour to the production of commodities of necessity, comfort, and pleasure, will have an ample and f u l l reward.

I do not wish to detain honourable members, but I have a very important matter to bring under the attention of the Home Affairs Department, and, in the absence of the Honorary Minister, I trust the I am sure Minister of Trade and Customs will make a note of the matter. I refer to the way in which electors are receiving notices could see his swelling pride about being struck off the r o l l . I have a copy of a notice served on a farmer in my electorate. This man has been living in the same place for two and a half years, and has not been away from his residence more than three days at a stretch. It would seem that some one is exceptionally eager to have people struck off the roll, though these people have every right not to be objected to. This is the notice my constituent has receivedNotice is hereby given that objection has been lodged to your name being retained on the electoral roll for the division of Maribyrnong, in the State of Victoria, on the following grounds -That you have ceased to reside in this division. political could that notice be sent? thafc is for the honourable member to hand me the papers. ister of what has occurred.

Upon this, I communicated with the Registrar, and asked side in one place for two and ceived a letter from the Registrar telling me that everything had been fixed up all right, and that the elector's name had not been expunged from the list. But why should a man be harassed in that way ? I cannot conceive of electoral officers doing these things on their own in i tiative. I have another case-that of a railway employee.

316,Mr Fenton,"I am telling the M i none of those humpies, or miserable hovels, the State Railway Department supplies for some of the stationmasters, but, in this case, the Department saw fit to be a little magnanimous and liberal, and built a new residence a few yards away, in the same railway grounds. Because this man and his family moved out of the old hovel into the new house, four names on the roll for the old place have been objected to. This is a condition of affairs in connection with electoral matters that should be stopped at once by any reasonable Government, and if I continue to receive more notices of objection like this, I shall go as far as to move the adjournment of the Souse on every day it is sitting to call attention to every objection I receive; and I shall advise my electors, if they are to be objected to in this manner, that the best thing they can do is for ""the whole of them to send in fresh claim cards to tbe Electoral Office. Then there will be a nice picnic. But I am not going to have these people disfranchised, and I bring this matter forward now, even at the risk of trespassing on the patience of honnot one of them. An officer cannot be orable members; because to take away from a man a vote to which he is entitled is one of the worse things that can happen to a community. I hope that the Minister will take notice of the matter. to bring under the notice of the Minister a similar matter. Last election day, in the Yarra division, a lady was prevented from voting, the objection being taken that her name had been struck off the roll. Afterwards I made inquiries, and found that it had been struck off because she and her granddaughter had the same names, and the latter was on the Ballarat roll. ment, and her name was subsequently placed on the roll again for the Abbotsford subdivision, but a day or two ago she received a card saying that ifc had been objected to a second time and her name had been struck off again, although she has been continuously residing in. the same house for many years. I have, of course, written to the Returning Officer for the Division of Yarra, asking him to have matters put right. I draw attention to the case here because, if names are to be struck off simply. because they are the same as other names, electors who possess names that are very common will run great risk of being disfranchised. If an elector can be struck off the roll, reinstated, and struck off a second time, although attention has been called to her case, goodness knows what may happen fco those with regard to whom no notice is taken. Having looked at the Budget-papers again, I find that £7,093,000 of invested money will be available for tbe Treasurer within twelve months. I overstated the time when I said just now that it would be available within sixteen months. There is another matter to which I draw attention. The Prime Minister, when interrogated this morning regarding a very important act of administration-the relieving from duty of the second member of the Naval Board, who came to this country with the highest recommendations from the Admiralty to assist in the development of the Naval Unit-aske d for notice of the question, and gave no information. There are some administrative acts which ought not to be paraded in Parliament, but this is suspended or relieved from duty, which is practically the same thing, and the fact be kept secret. This officer occupied important positions before he came here, and has enjoyed the confidence of two Governments in an important Commonwealth position. ' His standing is such that we ought to know what is the difference between him and the Executive. HadI been present when the question was asked, I should have myself desired information from the Prime Minister. To-night, of course, we have sworn a truce, it being agreed that no controversial matters would be entered upon, but I ask the Minister of Trade and CusI wrote to the Electoral Departtoms to be good enough to inform his chief that I consider that he should take' Parliament and the country into his full confidence in regard to this matter at the earliest moment. Whatever may be the views of the Government, I regard this action as a serious one. We should know whether Captain Onslow"" has been suspended for incapacity, or because of some difference on a question of policy. The Government cannot use its power to do an officer injury without giving an opportunity for the discussion of the action taken. I do not wish to press the matter further now. I am not speaking for Captain Onslow, because I have not been",58,Captain Onslow A Half Years And Be Objected To I Re

Why does he not join with me in denouncing the issue of a secret circular of thafc kind ? We are perfectly willing to meet circulars that are published openly, but it is only rarely that we have an opportunity of knowing of fche existence of secret circulars. ThatI venture to say that such circulars have been issued for some time past is apparent, because of the The creation and statement, in the circular to which I refer, ""that information is contained in previous circulars stating that the Labour party is more pliant than any other party in regard to pandering to the Roman Catholic vote."" In the report of my speech which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of 24th SeptemberI do not complain of the length of the report, which extends over twenty or t h i r t y lines, I condemned because that is as much as one can reasonably expect in a telegram, no matter how long the speech may be-it is stated that I said that the issue of the circular would have been all right in the days of Henry VIII . I did not say that it would be right at any time. I do not think that at any period of history any body of men should issue a secret circular condemning parliamentary candidates, and I am glad that he appealing to sectarian prejudices.

I shall not question the right of that organization, or of any other body, to issue to its members a confidential circular. ber believes in it f question the right of an association to issue a strictly private circular to its members, although I should object to its making a circular of this kind public. I hold the opinion that the honourable member should not have made use of the circular without first ascertaining whether it was issued with the consent or knowledge of the men affected by it . That is the course which a regard for the ordinary relations of life would dictate. In every-day life one would not think of making use of a confidential communication, except in so far as it related to oneself. That, however, is what the honourable member for Capricornia did not do. He would have been justified in quoting it in so far as it affected himself; bu t by his action he has compelled one of his own colleagues to make an explanation, and w ill cause others to do so. The honourable member has given to this circular a publicity that it would not have secured if he had not read it here. It will cause a lot of mischief. chief to the Liberal-Tory associations. they had anything to do with it . I have been able fco get along in this world without raising the sectarian devil, and I hope that I shall never hold a seat in this House, or in any other Legislative Assembly, if I can gain it only by such means. I strongly object to the honourable member using this circular for political purposes, I ask them not to think and by that means stabbing other people. secretly. to one Labour candidate. might well explain how the circular came into his possession.

WhatI object to is that, whenever a man is appointed to the Naval Board who has proved of any use to the Navy of Australia, he is got r i d of, by hook or by crook. Captain Hardy, an efficient sailor and organizer, with a faculty for managing men, came out from the Old Country with credentials as long as my arm, in order to take superintendence of the Naval Depot at Williamstown. We all know how hard it is to satisfy a body of men; but it was admitted that Captain Hardy used every endeavour to secure efficiency at the Dep6t generally. However, he fell foul of the Naval Board, and it was a question whether he or the N a v a l ' Board should go, and, of course, he went. 1 have met Captain Onslow several times, and it is evident that he is a sailor, and not a social man. His record proves his. efficiency and capacity for the position to which he was appointed. I do not wish to speak slightingly of the other members of the Board; but, as a matter of fact, he was the only sailor amongst them. Almost the whole of the naval work is done in my electorate of Melbourne Forts, and these matters come under my notice; but I have always found that, try as one will to get justice, no matter what Government are in power, nobody can get justice from the .Board. By hook or by crook they have always managed to get the best of the Ministry. If the Naval Board is the best system of running the show, we might as well give it up at once; and I would suggest to the present Go-, vernment that we ought to bring a man from the English Navy out here who'will be able to undertake the management of affairs, in place of the ineffective system, and the ineffective men, we have at the present time. A1-* though the Minister of Defence for the time being is always the Chairman of the Naval Board, he is hardly likely to have a great knowledge of naval matters; and' it is certain that, up to the present, so far as the Naval Board is concerned, there has been nothing but dissension, which, if it continues much longer, will lead to chaos. It would have been better if the Government, instead of suspending only one man, had suspended the whole [66] crowd of .them until some improvement was made. I do not want to use threats, nor to take advantage of my position in this House to make a cowardly attack on any member of the Board, bnt they certainly take advantage of their position on the Board to make cowardly attacks on other men. It is highly necessary for the Government to introduce some system of controlling the Naval Department that would be beneficial to Australia, instead of continuing the hybrid system in existence to-day. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 5.35 p.m.",64,Captain Onslow A Half Years And Be Objected To I Re
