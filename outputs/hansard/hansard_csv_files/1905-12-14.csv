Thursday, A.m., And Read Prayers; Asked By The Honourable Members For Maranoa, Bland, And Moreton, In Regard To The Appointment Of Colonel Lyster To The Position Of Commandant Of Queens","land, I have been furnished with the f o l lowing statement:Colonel Lyster has been temporarily appointed Commandant of Queensland during thi: absence on leave, of Colonel Plomer. TRe Minister has clearly intimated that this temporary appointment creates no claim to the permanent appointment. Colonel Lyster was the Officer Commanding referred lb jn the Drayton Grange Royal Commission's Report. The late G.O.C. reported that Colonel Lyster's administration as Commandant of South Australia for aperiod of eight months was not successful, and recommended bis transfer to the position of Chief Staff Officer in New South Wales, where he has been since January, 1904. He is the senior permanent officer now not holding command. The Inspector-General was not consulted. Such appointments come under the consideration of the Military Board.

OrderedThat the message be taken into consideration forthwith. External Affairs) I move That the Senate's amendments be agreed to. The amendments made by the Senate in this Bill do not touch any question of substance. The first provides that the Act shall commence on a date to be fixed by proclamation, to allow of notice of the alteration of the law being given at distant places, such as Port Darwin and Broome. Then, instead of making the language test a passage of not more than fifty words, it is-proposed to make it a passage of not less than fifty words in any prescribed language or languages. The provision ip clause 3 that any additional language prescribed shall not be taken to be sanctioned unless 'within a certain time the proposal has not been dissented from by Parliament has been altered so that no additional language may be used for the test, until its use has been assented to by Parliament, thus making the assent of Parliament positive instead of negative. The fifth amendment is a proposal to insert a new clause, which reads as follows: 3. Until a regulation prescribing any language or languages under section 3 of the Principal Act as amended by this Act, shall come into force, any language authorized by section 3 of the Principal Act before the commencement of this Act shall be deemed to be a prescribed language within the meaning of that section as so amended. That makes no alteration, except in the direct attention fo the fact that it will be form of the expression. ment proposes to leave out the word language test to require an immigrant to "" agent "" in a clause in which the word was write out, not only fifty words, but the not required. clause 12, is intended to meet, in a better fore, the provision is designed, not only way than we were able at the table, to shut out immigrants who cannot comthe suggestion of the honourable member for ply with certain conditions, but to really North Sydney for the protection of shipprevent any one from coming here. One owners against being called upon to deport officer may prescribe fifty words, and anoprohibited immigrants after they had been ther may call upon an immigrant to transhere for some time. ment which would accomplish the object so far as section 8 of the Act was concerned, but it was discovered that the ship-owners might be liable under other sections. Now it is proposed to limit their responsi, bility to the deportation of immigrants prohibited under sections 3 and 5 of the Act. With the one exception to which I have referred, these are merely drafting amendments. seems to me that one of these amendments is most important. It means that no language can be prescribed in addition to those already prescribed-and none are prescril:>ed except European languagesunless a resolution is passed by Parliament. Therefore, if it were desired to prescribe any other language in order to meet the susceptibilities pf any nation with which we were friendly, that course could be adopted only after a long and tolerablv angry debate in this House. That would involve the adoption of more offensive methods than those at present provided for. not add a language to those already prescribed, except by passing a special Act for that, purpose. tically no difference between the two provisions ; the amendment effects no improvement. The object of the Bill is to tone down the terms of the present Act by making them less offensive to friendly nations. But, as the result of the amendments made in this House, and further amendments proposed by the Senate, we are providing that no other language shall be prescribed except after a possibly angry debate in Parliament. That does not seem to me to be the way to conciliate a friendly nation. However, the responsibility lies with the' Government, and I can only enter my protest against what is now being done.

I should like to know whether the Minister will make the position plain to Colonel Ricardo? port referred to, and I do not know whether it is correct. All I can do is to bring it under the notice of the Minister of Defence, who, I am sure, will deal adequately with the case. Debate resumed from 13th December {vide page 6827), on motion by Sir WIL LIAM LYNE)That the Bill be now read the second time. A few minutes ago, the Minister told me across the table that he would be glad to present me with a copy of the speecli he delivered here yesterday. listened to his speech, I have no special desire to be furnished with a copy of it ; but I would suggest that when the Minister prepares a lucid explanation of a measure fhe least he should do is to pay this House the same compliment that he pays the Age. The honourable and learned member for Wannon very properly asked why honourable members cannot be treated with the same consideration and courtesy as the newspaper which is behind the Government. that this measure is the most important of 'the session. It far transcends any other that has been before us. As to its far-reaching character, no two opinions can be entertained. Its operation will extend to the uttermost ramifications of trade in the community. If the measure is the most important that has been introduced this session, I venture to suggest that a constitutional outrage has been perpetrated by bringing it before this Chamber after the Appropriation Bill has been assented to by the Governor General. Whoever heard of the one important legislative enactment of a session being thrown before a Chamber like this, after the Appropriation Bill had been passed by both Houses. I venture to suggest that on the next occasion we are considerate enough to afford the Senate an early opportunity to consider the Appropriation Bill, you, sir, should not allow the Bill to pass out of your hands until the business of this House is concluded. That is the constitutional procedure invariably adopted in other Legislatures of the Empire. We have departed from it in the belief that we should speedily wind up the session by passing such measures as were necessary to complete the ordinary sessional programme Immediately we surrendered our hold upon the finances, the Government began to introduce measures of infinitely more importance than any that have precedled them. This is an outrage which the House would be quick to punish if it had a proper sense of constitutional dignity. The Government have been guilty of political trickery, and have resorted to a practice which has been adopted for the first time in the history of this Parliament. In these closing hours of the session of a demoralized House, we are whittling away some of our most precious prerogatives and privileges-bu t no one seems to care. I , at least, shall record my protest against what I conceive to be a violaAfter having tion of the fundamental principles of constitutional Government. I have had to protest on previous occasions against similar action on the part of Ministers, and I shall probably have to raise my voice again and again with increasing fervour, in protest against important' Bills being introduced at this stage. The Minister yesterday, by way of extenuation, stated that the delay in the introduction of the measure, was due to the stonewalling of the Opposition. The answer to the Minister is to be found in The Age declares very properly the statement of one of his colleagues that the measure had not received its final preparation until two days ago. Therefore, the Minister has been guilty of a piece of effrontery in telling us that the late intro-",14,Immigration Restriction

May I suggest to the Prime Minister, in all seriousness, that the consideration of this Bill should be deferred till the next session? A Bill affecting profoundly-as this does-al l the trade and commerce of the Continent, ought not to be rushed through before the people who are most interested in it, who will suffer for whatever faults it may contain, have been afforded an opportunity of looking through it, with a view to making some representations fo the Government as to how their industrial activities will be influenced by it . point out that in the case of measures of infinitely less importance, the Government have paid the trading community the compliment of consultation. Customs Act was under consideration in this House, the then Minister of Trade and Customs, the right honourable member for Adelaide, confidentially submitted his proposals to the various Chambers of Commerce throughout Australia. Since then, the Trade Marks Bill was held in abeyance for weeks, in order that the trading community might be consulted concerning it, and might have an opportunity of making any representations that they thought fit, as to its possible effects. The same course was pursued in connection with the CommerceB ill. sideration a measure which transcends them all in its importance-is, forsooth, to be pushed through this Chamber in the closing hours of an already too long drawn out session. I say that the Prime Minister will be doing a great injustice to the people of the Commonwealth if he pushes this B ill through in this way, and the least that before a Board to establish their innocence. he can do is to defer its consideration until next session. should not be persisted in at the present time is that it purports to be a B ill to deal with trusts It is directed against two trusts in particular, which it is alleged are operating outside of Australia to the detriment of the public, by reason of the There is anharvesters which they are sending here to compete with our own manufacturers.

Why? Because some enterprising, gentleman outside has declared that he is being injured by the competition referred to. We have been told that the two firms whose methods are impugned, and against whom this legislation is specially directed, have already asked to be allowed to give evidence before the Tariff Commission.

But I would point out to the honourable member that before an inquiry can take place, there must be allegations.

In other words, he is to declare that in his opinion these people are guilty, and must be brought Another reason why it allegation, which,must be proved. a trust is required to prove that it is not engaging in unfair competition.

43,Mr Joseph Cook,"The wonder is that this Bil l would require them to do. We are told that this Bill is one to deal with trusts. It sets out broadly to do that by the establishment of a huge Government trust to take the place of private ones that are to be scotched. The Government are going to set up another which, in the tyranny of its action, the scope of its endeavours, and the results it will achieve, will be a more gigantic trust than any of which we have cognisance. the consumers and the traders of Australia in a more adverse way than any private trust that it seeks to replace.

The Bill may be broadly described as one to force up prices in Australia. In drafting this B ill , no thought was given to the consumers of Australia.

Under the first part there is to be a determined effort by legislative enactment to bring down the most efficient trading concerns to the level of the lowest. Any country must necessarily suffer when it sets out to do that. there can be only one concern; there is no competitor. of the Bill relates not merely to trusts, but to ordinary trading. The Bill is to enact Socialism legislative effect to many features of Socialism, without the assumption of socialistic responsibility by the Government. The responsibility is still to be left with the private individual. are gding to regulate for him, and, if need be, to prevent him from carrying it on except under conditions prescribed by this measure. If we are going in for Socialism. Jet the Government take over the whole concern, and accept the responsibility for its management.

By the time the honourable member has done with the workers of Australia they will be in a very prosperous condition, no doubt. This measure is entitled the "" Australian Industries Preservation B ill . "" In my judgment, it would be better termed "" The Australian Industries Destruction Bill."" That would unquestionably describe its object and effect. I appeal to the Ministry to give consideration to the fact that Australia is to-day a great exporting country, and must remain so for generations to come. However much we may try, within our borders, to stimulate our home industries, when we 'have done our best in that connection, Australia will still remain for many generations a great exporting country. With' our virgin continent and few people that must be so. Roughly speaking, our export trade is 30 per cent, of our total production. We may prohibit imports by this rough, rude, and ready method, but by the same proportion that we prohibit imports we prohibit exports; we prohibit the export of that upon which we depend for our very life blood. I have no desire to discuss the fiscal aspect of the question, but am speaking of broad principles of trade to which every one subscribes. Whatever we do, as protectionists or free-traders, in the way of regulating our commerce, the position is altogether different when we t-alte power, as is proposed by this Bill, to prohibit trade, and to make it a misdemeanour to import goods. The result must be bad to Australia. member resort to such extreme arguments? ing an extreme measure. I know, that the honourable member is a protectionist, but I have yet to learn that he is a prohibitionist. be effected by this measure, and which has nothing to do with the fiscal question, as such'. It is one thing to regulate our commerce, but if honourable members desire to secure protection, this Bill will be a dishonest means of obtaining it. The only way to secure protection for the industries of Australia is by the imposition of a protective Tariff. That would be honest, frank, and straightforward; but this is a dishonest way of sneaking in prohibition. It is not a proposal to impose a moderate protective Tariff, such as most of the protectionist members of this House profess to believe in. on the word of one man-the Comptroller General of Customs. come to that point. One would think that in introducing a measure of such far-reaching importance, the Minister would have made some effort to furnish data showing its necessity. But what are the facts? In moving the second reading of this Bill, the honourable gentleman did not mention anything to show the necessity for it. I believe that the Prime Minister made reference to letters that had been addressed to bim, but, if they be important and material as showing the necessity for legislative action., why were those letters not produced, or mentionmade at least of their effect? able member is speaking of what I said about the iron industry. the honourable and learned gentleman was speaking of the proposal now before us. of evidence has been placed before the House to show the necessity for this drastic action. If the harvester people are guilty of depredations upon the trade of Australia, surely that fact can be established by figures. ber advocating the cause of the Sydney Harvester Trust as against labour? speaking in advocacy of anv trust. If this Bill is to meet the depredations of trusts upon our trade, the fact that they are corr^iitting depredations ought first to be established.

If the honourable member had asked a question, Ministers would have rushed over each other in their anxiety to answer him, but because I seek information I am treated with contumely'. The Minister shows his utter want of appreciation of the amenities of his position when he objects tb a legal question being addressed to the Attorney-General. I wish to direct attention to the definition of what constitutes ""lower remuneration for labour."" It seems fo me that it is very faulty indeed It merely includes "" less pay or longer hours."" It should include both. Under the Bill, if a man employed by one industrial combination is working for longer hours than are the employees of other combinations, that fact is deemed to constitute one of the elements of unfair competition. I , should think it would be fairer to apply the test of the rate of remuneration per hour. We are told that in many industries in America the employees work for ten hours per day, but that of pay per hour than do those who Therefore, it seems to me that if we are to apply a. proper test, "" lower' remuneration for labour"" should be judged both from the stand-point of the hours and the pay, and particularly of the pay per hour. That, after all, is the real test of the effiabout the new industries which may be esciency of competition. Then, in this Bill, we get a definition of what is "" unfair competition."" troller-General of Customs is required to look after the whole of the industrial enterprises of Australiaa task which he cannot perform. We make the Minister a kind of socialistic boss, so far as the industrial life of the Commonwealth is concerned. He is supposed to interest himself in all matters relating to the welfare of the producers, the workers, and consumers. What does he know, about them? What special fitness has he to undertake this important inquiry into ramifications of the whole trading and producing interests of Australia? He cannot do it, and he will"" not do it. No man can do it orable member suppose that he will act on certain representations made to him by private persons ? trouble. Very likely he will act on ignorant and -interested representations. That is one of the dangers of"" the Bill. If we could be sure that he would act with knowledge and judgnient, there would be nothing, to be said against it. No one man can possess the requisite knowledge to undertake this stupendous task, and therefore I say that effect will not be given to the Bill. But the fact remains that the Minister is required to make the effortignorant, rude, and ruthless as it will be. That is the one danger that we have to fear. There is no doubt that the Comptroller-General of Customs knows as much about the ramifications of trade as any one man can do. But he does not know as much as the whole trading community, and therefore he can never be a proper judge as to what affects the interests of the w'/fkers, producers, and consumers all over Australia. Neither can any Board which the Minister may set up. The Comptroller-General has to frame an opinion as to what constitutes -"" unfair competition,"" as it relates to Australian industries, the preservation of which, in they receive a higher rate his opinion, is advantageous to the Commonwealth. Under this Bill, we actually are engaged in other industries. allot to him the task of declaring what industries should be preserved in the interests of the Commonwealth. How can he know that? How can he tell whether an industry is likely to prove advantageous to Australia? He cannot possibly know anything tablished. Yet he is the "" Pooh-Bah"" to whom this matter will be referred. If he First of all, the Compcomes to the conclusion that an industry is not engaging iri competition in such a way as to lead to the preservation of Australian industries, he is obliged to report accordingly. Then we are told in the Bill that competition is to be regarded as unfair, and is to be legislated out of existence, if it will probably lead either to Australian goods being withdrawn from the market, or being sold at a loss, unless they weire produced at a lower rate of remuneration to labour. One would think that the Comptroller-General would have plenty to do in inquiring into the existing order of things. But he is to do more than that. He is required to forecast the future effect 1 of competition upon these industries. In",22,Australian Industries Preservation Bill Second Reading

I repeat that "" lower remuneration "" should take into account both the hours worked and the wages paid. That is the true competitive test, orable member think that that is a matter which would come under the purview of the Board? can only give effect to what is set forth in . the B ill . We might settle this matter satisfactorily if the Minister were out of the Chamber, because the Attorney-General might then be able to speak without giving him offence. Another matter which has to be investigated by the Comptroller-General relates to whether the means adopted by the importer or seller of imported goods are unfair under the circumstances, I notice that the "" means"" which are to be investigated relate only to the importer or seller. Why should not inquiries be also made into the "" means"" adopted by our local producers? should say, might include advertising, agencies, and so forth. Is it not inquisitorial in the last degree to inquire into the "" means adopted "" for the sale of goods ? There may be a reason for inserting that provision, but I should like to hear what it is. The Bill further provides that if a person is importing goods or selling imported goods, and is a commercial trust, his competition is deemed unfair. That is to say, a person who is a trust is ruled out by this legislation as an unfair competitor. He is declared to be guilty before he has been tried. The fact that he exists at all proves him to be a trade murderer. I say that that is not British justice. provides. way.

I venture to say that a similar request has never been refused in any Parliament in The ""means adopted,"" I the world, and no Minister but the present Minister of Trade and Customs would be guilty of such a gross act of discourtesy. Further, if competition be deemed by the Comptroller-General to be such as will result in the' disorganization of Australian industry or in throwing workers out of employment, it is deemed to be unfair. I should like to know what industry resting upon a competitive basis is not more or less disorganized at nearly every point of its existence? If a new machine be introduced into a shop, it disorganizes the whole establishment, and possiblv displaces labour. Is that to be deemed unfair competition? Under this definition it would be.

The Board has also to make inquiry as to any goods, things, or matters whatsoever which they consider pertinent, necessary, or material.

196,Mr Joseph Cook,"I s Mr McKay atrust, whether local or foreign, should be brought under control. The Bill deals not only with foreign, but also with local combinations. We have had evidence of the manipulations of the trusts in America. I would refer honourable members to two enormous volumes in the Library, which contain information collected by Congress with regard to the operations of the American trusts. There they will find indications of the extremes to which the manipulations and exploitations of the trusts have been carried on. Similar operations are certain to be conducted here, and, in fact, they are being carried on to-day. The methods of the trusts are not apparent to those who look merely at the surface of things. They take good care that what they are doing does not appear on the surface. The Bill provides means by which the surface can be broken, and their operations can be brought into the full light of day. We should be foolish if , in considering this question, we entirely shut our eyes to what has taken place in America, where trusts have assumed the largest proportions. We should take warning by the shocking example which the ""United States presents of long continued indifference on the part of those responsible for the welfare of the body politic. The Legislature of America is largely to blame for not having taken action in regard to trusts when they could have been more easily grappled with. We should take heed of the teachings of history, and not allow the trusts to assume such magnitude that they cannot unless with great difiSculty be combated. The trusts devise means by which the public can be completely hood-winked. They are able to cover uvwhat they are doing, and we can obtain a knowledge of their transactions only by invoking the power of the law. The evils brought about in America have been manifold. In the first place, the operations of the trusts tend to reduce employment; and in the second to increase the cost ofliving. The moment that a trust gets into working order employment is reduced. We have had a case in point in Australia. The great tobacco combine has closed up a number of factories, and a number of men, from managers down to leaf strippers,, have been thrown put of employment. Evidence was given by one*of the managers of the combine that the trust was brought about partly with the object of reducing the cost of administration. honourable member wait until the Tobacco Committee can make its report? inquiring into the effects of the tobacco combine, so much as into the question of the desirability of the Government taking over the industry. The evidence given, however, has been sufficient to demonstrate the evils attendant upon such large combinations. Committee can bring up their report it is proposed to alter the whole state of affairs. ways, been used in favour of delay. I do not think that the inquiry now being conducted by the Committee need be interfered with in the slightest degree. The question as to whether the Government shall take over the industry is not involved in the measure before us. The reduction of employment to which I have referred is always followed by two great evils from which this country has already suffered in some cTIegree, namely,, centralization and concentration. The factories of-the tobacco combine are now carried on only in the greater centres of population. The smaller factories have been obliterated, and the employees have been thrown, on the streets. I am sure fhat honourable members who are aware of the ill effects of centralization would not favour industrial methods which would accentuate the evil. One of the first results of monopoly is an increase in the price of the commodities which the trusts put upon the market. This increase is not always apparent. The consumer is not always aware that he is paying a higher price. When a combine has the power to reduce the quality of an article, it invariably does so, and thus in effect considerably increases its cost. The article' does not last so long and does not stand the same wear and tear as does one manufactured under conditions of fair competition. The International Harvester Trust has publicly announced that it has secured 90 per cent, of the world's trade, and intends to obtain the rest. That may be a very laudable ambition on the part of a trading concern, but it is one which I am sure that honourable members are not prepared to assist that combination to attain. As the result of a long and sad experience, we recognise .that if we were placed entirely at ^the mercy of such a trust, the advancement of our agricultural industry would be seri-",28,William Lyne Th E Honourable I F It Were Admitted That Trusts And Mono

The first Before they were threatened with thing a trust does is to reduce the price of fhe article, and when its monopoly has been thoroughly established, to raise the price again, or to put on the market goods of an inferior quality, or perhaps do both'. I think I have succeeded in showing that any consideration which a trust, local or foreign, may extend tp the consumer, will not necessarily be of a permanent character. The experience of other countries has been that a reduction in price, which has evidently been made for the purpose of securing a monopoly, has invariably been followed, either by an increase in the cost of the goods, or a reduction in their value, or both. We must assume that a similar result will follow the efforts which are at present being made in one particular direction in Australia. Surely free-traders and protectionists alike-becaus e .

In regard to local monopolies, I may mention that some years ago, as a member of the Victorian Parliament, I made inquiries into the methods adopted by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I found that that company, owing to the power which it then possessed of securing different prices for its product in the various States, was able to amass a considerable profit year by year. In addition to having a monopoly of the trade in refined sugar,, it was able, at the beginning of a sugar season, to compel the growers of Queensland to accept a certain price for their cane, irrespective of the yield. this Bill will not touch that company. ber will read its provisions, he will see that it applies to trusts, whether they are within or without Australia. to imports? Sir ter-State trade. second reading of the B ill , that I did not think it would apply to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. ion be correct, I sincerely hope that before the measure leaves this Chamber it will be made to apply to every combine which is inimical to the interests of the consumer. The tobacco monopoly, which does extend beyond the -borders of individual States, and which, to mv own knowledge, has secured the trade of Australia in a way that would not be permitted under this B ill , has a very simple, but mosFeffective, method of securing its profits. It is a most effective combination, because it embraces both manufacturers and importers. Let us suppose that a distributor in a country town desires to obtain a supply of a particular brand of tobacco, which he finds tlhat his customers fancy-and we know that there are no persons who are more fanciful in their tastes than those who drink liquor and smoke tobacco-and . that he applies to the head office for, say, five boxes of that tobacco, which we will assume is called the "" M a r y B r o w n "" brand. HeI am afraid that the honimmediately receives a letter stating that, unfortunately, there is no tobacco of this brand in stock. He then asks if the combine can supply him with even a couple of boxes to meet immediate requirements. To that communication a similar answer is made, but he is informed that the combine has another brand of equal quaJity in stock at a price of 3d. per lb. less,, and, eventually, he finds himself compelled to purchase it. Under such circumstances I contend that both the consumer and the distributor are absolutely in the power of the combine. Nobody outside it either imports or manufactures these particular tobaccoes. The honourable member for North Sydney has aisked why this information was not given to the Select Committee which is inquiring into the question of the tobaccomonopoly. The explanation, to my mind, is very simple. The distributors are entirely dependent for their supplies upon the combine, and is it likely If the honourable memthat they will give information against it? that they would not dare to do so* sure that fhis B ill will apply to the tobacco combine ? I said, in moving the apply to the combine. house of the combine has this most significant paragraph upon its price-listI f the Minister's opinGoods supplied in this State must not be exported to other States.

I have already shown that in the case of one article, at least, that is not so. It has been said that this Bill is intended to prohibit importation-that it marks a further advance in the protective policy of the Commonwealth. I deny that. It is a Bill which is intended to prohibit unfair competition, and that term has been clearly denned. Under it dumping will be prohibited. comes in. This Bill will prohibit the dumping of the products of other countries at a price below their value, to the detriment of the established industries of the Commonwealth, and it will also prohibit the initiation of unfair competition which would result in the destruction of local industries. Dumping is prohibited in the interests of the three classes of the community who are specially mentioned in the Bill, namely, the producers, the workers, and the consumers. I feel sure that every honourable member will admit that although the dumping of cheap goods may confer a temporary benefit upon those who use them, it is almost invariably followed by opposite results. The dumping of cheap goods means the destruction of local industries, and the destruction of those industries must eventually place those using articles so produced entirely at the mercy of the importer. In my opinion, the principle of this measure must be affirmed. The honourable member for North. Sydney, with that extensive and successful business experience which he possesses-a n experience of which this House has been glad from time to time to avail itself-mus t feel that there is some demand in Australia for a Bill of this character. I feel sure that his extensive knowledge of the commercial world will lead him to recognise that there is growing up in Australia a tendency among the great suppliers of the community to combine. They find it to their advantage to do so. No one knows that better than does my honourable friend. Although he may consider that some of the provisions of the Bill are too drastic, I am [234] confident that the principle involved will be affirmed by him; that, as a free-trader, he . is in favour of doing away with practices which can tend only to lessen fair and healthy competition. I am satisfied that his fiscal beliefs lead him often in the direction of securing that there shall be that proper trade rivalry which we are told must We have been told that the result to the advantage of all concerned. In these circumstances, I am_sure that he will be found .supporting the second reading of the Bill. Although he may be prepared in Committee to propose certain amendments, I fail to understand how he and those who think with him could at the present juncture offer any serious objection to the motion for the second reading. As I have said, the principle must be affirmed; Australia must not be the exploiting ground of the dumper. That is where the prohibition member think that we ought to have some and others interested, as to the necessity for this Bill? speech has been in the direction of showing the necessity of preventing abuses. proof, but of assertion. will pardon me if I do not reply to his interjections, vociferous though they may be, since I should not for one moment endeavour to prove anything to his satisfaction. We have heard of the one juryman who complained of the obstinacy of his eleven fellow jurors, and I feel sure that in such a position my honourable friend would be found in the minority. I am not going to attempt to prove anything to him; but I ask him to accept my assurance that my desire is to prevent the creeping into Australia of those abuses which most people admit exist in great industrial countries. We hope to make Australia a great industrial centre, and, that being our desire, we must see to it, at the outset; that we do not allow to fasten upon our industrial life such a vampire as the combine has proved itself to be in older countries. As a protectionist, I believe that protection should be of a triple character; it should protect, not only the manufacturer, but the operative and the consumer.

The evils in America to which he referred are matters of common knowledge. writers have published works in advocacy as well as in condemnation of trusts and combines. Men who are quite as sincere in their beliefs as we are, have published works, with the object of showing that trusts are acting in the best interests of the community, but it seems to me that thia measure is not unlike one, introduced in the first Parliament, which was designed to regulatetrade, by means of the appointment of an Inter-State Commission. ThatB ill was ill-digested by the Minister responsible for it . Underlying this measure there is a great deal of truth, but the facts with which it is designed to deal have not been digested, nor have the remedies proposed been made thoroughly clear. The Minister of Trade and Customs, in introducing the Bili, referred to various Acts of Parliament to which his attention had been called by the 1 Attorney-General, and it seems to me that now that intimation has been given ai, to where information relating to the need for this measure may be obtained,, honourable members should be able to secure much valuable reading for the recess. outcome of this discussion, a B ill might be introduced next session that would be acceptable to the whole of the people. On the other hand, the measure now before us is unsatisfactory, because it is designed, in my opinion, to destroy rather than to promote trade. It will tend to destroy the native industries of Australia, which we wish to encourage in every way. It appears that if it become law an importer will run the risk at every turn of having his goods seized at a reasonable price. to buy his goods in the cheapest market, so that he may secure a ready sale for them, ancl there comes a time in the business of every small trader when it is found necessary to have a general sale in order to "" raise the wind "" to meet bills falling due. sacrifice of the residue of the stock of the small trader in this way. In many cases, at these sales, goods are disposed of at, a loss, but the trader will tell you that,, having made a good profit out of his first sale, he is able to share with the public the profits he has made. Under this B ill , however, any one who holds such a sale will be penalized; he will have his goods I listened with great interest seized, and the general public will lose the opportunities now offering to make purchases at reasonable rates. I do not think We also know that various that trade can be successfully carried on under such a law. The first part of the B ill , and more particularly clause 4, affords an indication that it is foredoomed. Its provisions recall to mind certain incidents which occurred during the first Parliament, when the corridors were beseiged by manufacturers who were running obsolete machinery, and found that they could not compete with the manufacturers of, say, New South Wales, who had hacl to face importations from abroad in what was practically an open market. As soon as the people of this Stare were brought into keen competition with' the manufacturers of New South Wales, they found that their obsolete machinery had to be cast aside. Prior to the imposition of the Federal Tariff, they were protected from the up-to-date machinery of outside manufacturers. ber has a vivid imagination. shoe nail industry, carried on by a man and a boy, in the honourable member's elec-' torate, could not exist without some special As the provision.

If , as the result of keen competition, a manufacturer could not obtain the prices that he formerly secured for his goods would not that lead to a lower remuneration for labour? Those who claim to be the exclusive representatives of labour believe that this provision means that this Bill will result in higher rates of wages, but if we allowed a manufacturer to use obsolete machinery and obtain a large price for his goods, whilst the cost of the articles which he used were increased, no greater remuneration would be secured by him than he would gain by the use of up-to-date machinery. it is provided thatIn the following cases the competition shall be deemed unfair until the contrary is proved.

No doubt the Minister would appoint thr'se capable men to the proposed Board, but it would be very difficult for them to exercise satisfactorily the powers which are conferred by the Bill. Of necessity, the profits obtained by an importer whose machinery is not of the best, and whose business is small, must he less than those of the manufacturer whose machinery is thoroughly up-to-date, and whose business is immense. Competition is also to be deemed unfairI f the imported goods, have been purchased In sub-clause 2 of clause 4 abroad at prices greatly below their ordinary cost of production where produced, or market price where purchased. It is a common thing for merchants to buy in England, or on the Continent, at the end of the season, large quantities of goods, which can then be obtained greatly below cost price, the holders being glad to get rid of them in order to make way for new season's goods.

It is now proposed to use a steamhammer in order to straighten a pin. only case of importance, so far as imported goods are concerned, which has suggested the desirability of dealing with trusts, is one which affects a single manufacturer in our midst, and I ask whether we are to allow one firm to dominate Parliament to the extent of inducing us to rush through, after only a few hours' consideration, a measure affecting, not only a particular enterprise, but all the industries of the Commonwealth? I would rather see a measure introduced providing merely that no harvesters shall be imported into Australia. We are being asked to create an enormous instrument, which may have influences the results of which we cannot conceive, and which may be used in a manner which we cannot anticipate, in order to effect one comparatively small result. I would also point out that we have appointed a Royal Commission, which is doing its work with extreme care, for the very purpose sf considering what should be done in connection with those of our industries which are affected by the operation of the Tariff. That Commission could have this matter referred to it , and, indeed, it has power to consider this question without any special authority from us. ignoring the Commission altogether, and I think that we are thereby paying a very poor compliment to gentlemen who were induced to undertake a very difficult task. take out of their hands a matter upon which we need the very fullest information, and we are, in effect, saying that we have not sufficient confidence in them to permit them to inquire into it . The Minister seems to be very confident with regard to the measure and its probable effects. I know something about trade, commerce, ancl manufactures, and I confess that it is very difficult for me, with my knowledge and experience, to form a conclusion as to the probable effects of the measure, and as to the injuries it may inflict, not merely upon importers, but upon the industries of the Commonwealth. The Minister quoted certain legislation in other cbuntries as affording him warrant for the introduction of the Bill. I would ask, however, whether he can point to any laws of other countries which contain provisions similar to those embodied in the first portion of the Bill? sure that the Minister can find no preThe cedent for the. most dangerous provisions of this measure. In quoting the United States and Canadian laws as his authorities, the Minister overlooked the fact that he has departed from those laws, and has reversed the very principles upon, which they are based. The United States law is intended to prevent restraint of trade, and to debar trusts from exercising control of the markets, and levying excessive prices upon the consumers. has done. achieved much good so far, but the object is to prevent trusts from improperly controlling the market, in other words, to take out of their hands the power which they are exercising a power which properly belongs to the Government of the country-of taxing the people for their own benefit. The money raised by taxes levied by fhe Government is spent in the interests of the whole people., whereas the profits derived by the trusts are devoted to the advantage of a few persons. The United States Government are not concerned as to whether the trusts are making a profit or as to whether We are the people who distribute the goods are making a profit. Their object is to prevent the consumer from being excessively taxed. I am thoroughly in agreement with legislation which effectually brings about such We are proposing to a result. Then the Canadian law is, in one important respect, different entirely from the measure before us. One portion of that law was adopted for the declared purpose of preventing the excess output of manufactures elsewhere from being dumped upon the Canadian market, and sold at cost, or a shade under cost. That law may be put in force whenever the Ministry thinks fit. It has been acknowledged by some of the Canadian statesmen that the principal effect of that law has been to act as a warning against such importations into Canada. this Bill would have the same effect. Canadian Act has been enforced in very few, if any, cases, and it is very difficult for the Canadian Government to give effect to it. The other portion of the Canadian law provides that where trusts are",35,William Lyne Th E Honourable I F It Were Admitted That Trusts And Mono

All that we could expect, either from a Federal or a State Judge, would be the examination of the matter submitted to him, and the furnising of a report upon the facts. The Minister, subject to his responsibilitv to Parliament-subject , indeed, to the responsibility of the whole Government to Parliament-wil l decide what steps shall be taken. We have done all that we can in that direction, and ho charge may properly be levelled at the Government in respect to the tribunal named in the Bill. the Bill provision is made for a Judge to deal with certain matters. different matter. Surely the giving of a judicial decision in a criminal casea case -that mav be dealt with by a Court-shoul d not be the duty of a Board. The position is entirely different from a matter which is simply one for Ministerial action. It has been suggested that this Bill is drastic, and that there is no need for it. I have already addressed to the House some observations in that regard. Some honourable members have said that there is no evidence whatever that the International Harvester Company is a trust; some honourable members have said that it is an ordinary company; that it is not in the Ordinary sense a trust possessed of enormous power; that it is not invested with those attributes which would cause it to be regarded in America as a trust. The evidence as to the nature of this company is altogether overwhelming. to which the honourable and learned member has just referred ? made in various directions. I heard one honourable member say that, if it could be proved that the company is really a trust, he would vote to protect the manufacturers of this country. stantial difference 'between a trust and a company; it is only a matter of size. difference; but I will deal with that.point when I , come to speak on the clauses of the B ill . In America there is an Inter-State Commerce Commission, whicli had recently to consider the position of the International Harvester Company in connection with railway rates and other matters; and in the tenth volume of its report, at page 386 and subsequent pages, it makes some observations which, I think, will convince honourable members and the community as to the position and status of this companyThe International Harvester Company was organized in 1902, apparently for the purpose of 'consolidating under one management several concerns previously engaged in the manufacture of farm machinery. It ' took over ancl is now operating the Deering Harvester Company, the McCormick Harvester Company, the Piano Company, the South Chicago Furnace Company, In one part of and perhaps others. In this discussion the McCormick division of the International Harvester Company will be known as the McCormick Company, and the Piano division as the Piano Company. The International Harvester Company now has the same interest in the Illinois Northern Railroad and the Chicago, West Pullman, and Southern Railroad, which the McCormick Company and the Piano Company formerly had, respectively. The Illinois Northern Railroad Company was incorporated in 1901, under the laws of the State of Illinois, .with a . capital stock of $500,0001. While this capital stock did originally, and perhaps does to-day, stand in the names of various individuals, it was entirely paid for by cash furnished by the McCormick Company, was entirely owned by that Company down to the time of its absorption by the International Harvester Company, and is to-day the property of the latter company. Whatever has been said with respect to the Illinois Northern, applies equally to the Chicago, West Pullman, and Southern. The International Harvester Company owns these two railroads. Its officials are the officials of those roads in most instances. It absolutely controls the operations of the roads, as well as the routing of its own traffic. The International Harvester Company owns the Illinois Northern Railroad. Whatever profit accrues to that railroad inures to the benefit of the Harvester Company, its owner, alone. When any one of these lines leading from Chicago to the Missouri River pays to the Illinois Northern Railroad Company $12.00 for the performance of a switching service, which is worth reasonably but $3.00, it gives to the International Harvester Company, the shipper of that carload of merchandise, Sg.oo. If these divisions, which have been in effect since January, 1904; are legal, there is no practical limit to the extent to which the lines granting them may prefer the International Harvester Company over other shippers.",46,Thomson I F A Dom And Experience Is Not Represented By

It is entirely immaterial whether this monev goes in the first instance into the treasury of the International Harvester Company or that of its creature, the Illinois Northern Railroad Company. The question presented by the operations of the Chicago, West Pullman,"" and Southern Railroad differs from that involved in those of the Illinois Northern, in that the International Harvester Company owns a controlling interest in the West Pullman Company, but has not the entire ownership. . . . while other parties are in reality interested, the International Harvester Company is, without <!oubt, the overshadowing factor. The Chicago, Lake Shore, and Eastern, as found, Is the creature of the United States S£eel Corporation. The questions presented by its operations differ from those already discussed, chiefly Tn that the practices are'of longer continuance and of wider scope. The International Harvester Company, through the medium of its railroads, obtains no divisions whatever from eastern lines; hut the United States Steel Corporation, with its greater power, has been able to force from eastern connexions divisions on all business. The Incernntional Harvester Company has not yet been able to compel the railroads which handle its traffic to maintain its tracks, or perform its switching service within its iron working plant at South Chicago; but the Illinois Steel Company has for the last eight years obtained from the railways transporting its traffic compensation for the maintenance and operation of the miles of track which are located within its private works. In this respect the Steel Trust, to use the popular expression, is as far in advance and in the second part of the Bill the same of the Harvester Trust as the latter company is ahead of the o'r'dinary shipper. That huge company has extended its operations to this country, and until recently charged ^ 8 r to the farmers for ihe stripper harvesters which it sends here. Tliat charge is justified in the following words, published in a paper called the Reformer, issued on the 31st August of thi-s vear. in which, at page 17, its case is plainly put for the companyFinally, The Reformer would show farmers how it is that they have to pay ,£8i for a machine which is Invoiced at £ 3 8 os. 3d. which they must pay is made up of prime cost, expenses incurred in bringing the machfne to Australia, selling expenses in Australia itself, ancl profit. It has been given on oath before the Tariff Commission by both MrH . V. McKay and by Mr James Moore, of T. Robinson and Company, who spoke as a delegate chosen by the metropolitan manufacturers, that these latter expenses, the selling expenses, amount to. "" 27 per cent, of the selling price,"" which works out at ^21 17s. sd. per machine. We have, therefore, the elements to show how the case stands, providing the selling expenses of the importing houses are the same as those of local makers, viz. :Original cost ... ... ... ,£38 o 3 Importing expenses ... ... 14 16 b Duty (on old scale) ... ... S 4 7 Selling expenses ... ... 21 17 5 Total cost ... .... ^79 18 9 This would leave importers a profit of only £ 1 is. 3d. per machine, which obviously is not extortionate. It is, however, probable that the selling expensesof importers are kept somewhat lower by good management than those of thc local makers, and that, consequently, their proI n the case before us, fits are somewhat higher than"" shown here. "" Somewhat higher,"" I suppose, means something very small. But when tiis company found that the Minister of Trade and Customs was firm in his determination to increase the valuations at which these machines were entered for duty, it reduced its selling price to ^70 for one machine, j£6o for two, and ^50 for three. Is there any other explanation for that reduction than that the company is determined to oust the Australian manufacturer at all costs, and, no doubt, if successful, would, when it got the market to itself, put up the price again to £ $ 1 ? tralian manufacturers in a combination with the company ? fend any combine. I am as strongly opposed to Australian as to other combines, penalties are imposed on Australian as on foreign trusts. I do not pretend to know all the ramifications of the methods adopted by these companies, but my information has been obtained from well'-known and irreproachable sources. If the statements which have been made are not true, the real facts can be demonstrated by those .from whom an explanation is sought. It will be seen by referring to the Bill, however, that those who wish to attack these trusts have four fences to get over' before fhey can succeed.

When we have decided that it is an industry of that advantageous nature, what is the next point to be borne in mind ? We have next to consider ""What is unfair competition? ' In view of some of the mistaken criticisms which have been passed upon paragraph a of sub-clause i of clause 4, I should like the attention of honourable members. Honourable members have asked me to give some explanation, and I intend to do so. provided thatCompetition shall be deemed to be unfair if (a) under ordinary circumstances of trade it Act, has not defined "" u n f a i r competition,"" would probably lead to the Australian goods being either withdrawn from the market or sold at a loss unless produced at a lower remuneration for labour.

Practically this portion of the B ill is aimed at conspiracy to defraud' the public, or to destroy industries. We come now to the question of aiding and abetting. I think that it was the honourable member for North Sydney who said he could not understand how we were going to carry out the provisions of clause 1.2. Precisely the same point was raised in connection with the CommerceB ill . It was then explained that the act therein aimed at is an act committed in Australia. If a man in Australia commits an act in furtherance of something done outside, in defiance of this law, he will be liable. Clause 13 provides a civil remedy. The Attorney General, acting for the whole Commonwealth, may go to the Court, and say, "" Something is going on in contravention of this Act. We do not wish to resort to criminal proceedings; we ask the Court to decide that that of which we complain is in contravention of the Act, and we appeal tp.it to stop it . "" There is no question of the Minister stepping in to decide the matter. It is to be threshed out in open Court. Could anything, be fairer? Clause 13 is based on the Sherman Act. Whilst we provide for criminal liability, and the proper power of prevention to be vested in the Court, at the instance of the Attorney-General, we recognise that individuals may be irreparably injured. It may be that a powerful capitalistic company can come into the country, and crush local producers or manufacturers. In that event the penalty is to be upon the wrong-doers, by the giving of treble damages, just as it is provided by the Sherman Act. Such an undertaking takes the chance of ousting the local market, and obtaining an enormous advantage; let it run the risk of incurring severe penalties if it be found out. Following the example of the Sherman Act, we provide that treble damages may be rlecovered.

I was not able to discover the report of the ultimate judgment. statement, not of the honourable and learned member for Wannon,' but of some one else who had supplied him with information. charitable' remark.

I respect their desires, and accept their assurances that their intentions are strictly honourable, but I hope that they will not be too remote. I hope that my honourable friends opposite will endeavour to give effect to those intentions at the earliest opportunity. In view of the circumstances to which I have alluded, the Government feel that they would not be justified in going to their Christmas dinner, leaving a great number of their fellow-Australians, perhaps, with the prospect of not having one themselves. I believe that this is a great measure. I do not for one moment suggest that we cannot, in Committee, evolve amendments here and there which will improve it. We are here to suggest and improve. But I do say that the scope, the frame, and the central principle of the Bill are distinctly loval to, and that I believe that they have the approbation of, the people of Australia . -.Although the particular wording of this Bill, has not been before the country, the essence of it is well known. Time after time, Governments have promised an Anti-Trust Bill, and we all know the general scope of anti-trust legislation. We have not departed very far from the Sherman Act, with the general provisions of which every one is familiar. Where we have departed from it, we have gone in the direction of providing less drastic remedies, except, as I have pointed out, in regard to the destruction of Australian industries. man Act protect the small companies against to be the a combine of big local companies ? understand the trend of the honourable member's question, I cannot say that I remember any such provision; but I shall look into the matter. There is no time like the present to do these things, and, on behalf of the Government, I would sincerely and earnestly appeal to honourable members to use their best endeavours to expedite the passing of the Bill into Committee. It appears, if we are to accept the assurance of honourable member's opposite, that there is an unanimous desire to protect Australian industries, and to repress the aggression of trusts upon the people of Australia. But, in the absence of such a measure as this, the vista we have before us is not pleasant to contemplate; and unless we meet it manfully and fearlessly-honorabl e members may call it drastically, if they will-ou r motto for the future will be not ""Advance Australia,"" but ""God help Australia."" ment the Ministry on having at this early stage in the debate put forth their great protagonist, the Attorney-General, to defend this Bill.

The excuse for doing so is not'to be found in one of the closing allegations of the Attorney-General to the effect that the question of whether certain people are to enjoy their Christmas dinners depends upon the passing of this Bill. If that does not savour of the introduction of cant and prejudice into this debate, I do not know what would. If the measure is a far-reaching one, the conditions which justified its introduction must have been foreseen long since. The honourable gentleman might have introduced a measure at a time when it could have been carefully considered and debated Such a statement under that f u l l light of publicity'which is so necessary when commercial and mercanTo my mind, it is tile interests are affected, and when proper attention could have been given in Committee to the points arising out of the various To some extent, the honourable clauses. I call it scarcely less than fatuity to try to place this measure on the statute book between now and Christmas Eve. The mere attempt is unfair to the interests affected, and to the great mercantile public. The Attorney-General referred to the pressure responsible for this measure as due to a recent reduction in the prices of the machines imported by the International Harvester Company. I wish to weigh with an unprejudiced mind any case presented to this House,' and am, therefore, desirous that the matter shall be put before us in all report of the Tariff Commission has been made, so that we may do justice to all the interests concerned. I have not hitherto heard a case presented by the local manufacturers against the International Harvester Company or other importers, which justifies me in voting for the B ill .

467,Mr Glynn,"I have looked carefullyspondence, as a corrective of the statements of the Attorney-General. He mentioned that the International Harvester Company had reduced its prices from £&i to ^70 for one machine, to £ 6 0 for two, and to £ 5 0 for three, and a similar statement was made in a letter which appeared in the Melbourne Age of the 13th October -thoug h I have not made exhaustive reThat letter was followed immediately by one from the International Harvester Company, in which it was pointed out that they had for some time previously been selling their machines at from £ 7 0 to ^75 each. They explained that their reason for doing so was that the combine's price was too high, and that the small manufacturers, whose machinery was imperfect, compared with theirs, had also been selling at the lower prices; and I have seen that statement repeated in many quarters. The writers very properly asked why large manufacturers, who might be supposed to have the best kind of machinery in their works, courd not make a reduction in price similar to that of the small local manufacturers, whose machinery might not be quite so gpod. turer at Corowa, in my electorate, was selling his machines for j£8o each. things happen in the honourable gentleman's electorate at times. I am dealing with the newspaper dialectics only for what they are worth, and, in my opinion, the counter statement to which I have referred is of as much importance as the original statement quoted by the Attorney-General. He referredi, towards the close of his speech, to the Bill itself, and it is a pity that honourable members have not a month or two in which to consider the real bearing of its clauses. WE are all, as were those who walk the torrid pavements of a certain region, which I hope none of us will reach hereafter, actuated by good intentions; but the public expect something more. They require a certain, amount of scrutiny to be given to the machinery proposed to carry out any policy, even though that policy may be acknowledged to have been sent by Providence itself. Under clause 14, local manufacturers are to be permitted, not only to prevent foreign manufacturers from competing with them, but to recover treble damages. I interjected, when the Attorney General was speaking, that the (Courts award damages only where the bad results of certain actions complained of can be directly traced, and it will require great ingenuity to prove that any local manufacturer, has suffered such special harm by the importation of foreign machinery as to justify the awarding to him of treble damages. That surmise, I 'think, is justifiable, in view of the fact that, so far as I know searches-in only one or two instances, since the Sherman Act was passed in 1:890, have proceedings been instituted under it to recover treble damages, and they included the case referred to by the honourable and learned member for Wannon. I hope, therefore, that our friends, the manufacturers of this country, will not be duped, either by this plausible clause, or by the more plausible explanation of it which has been given. It is a little too bad that the Bill should have been framed to strike a blow at an import trade about 70 or 80 per cent, of which comes from -British Possessions, and mostly from the mother country. They have acted differently in New Zealand. That country is frequently referred to here as an example to IUS, .and Ministers, not having much power of initiation, are very fond of copying New Zealand legislation, relying upon the democratic reputation of Mr Seddon to get it passed. They do not, however, copy that gentleman's virtues. The Minister has adopted only the debatable portions of his policy, and left the rest to the winds. The New Zealand Act, I think, does not apply to British goods. If that is so, our Act has about three times its compass, and directly affects a much larger importation. the combine is a Yankee or a British one.? are so clear that it does not need consideration, there is no more to be said. But it seems to me a' strange course to provide against evils which are merely surmised. We have not been given proof of the need for this legislation, and have not even waited for the report of the Tariff Commission. It has been introduced on the mere conjecture that a certain state of things may arise, and continue in existence for a few weeks or months. To meet sucb an occurrence, we are asked to practically suspend the operation of the Tariff, and to substitute prohibition for the range of duties which was elaborated after eleven months of debate in the first session of this Parliament.

It is therefore repugnant to British justice. American legislation, but on looking at the Sherman Act, I can find no provision which is aimed against attempts to lower prices. Mr Glynn. The Sherman Act of 1890 is intended to protect trade and commerce against unlawf u l restraints and monopolies. against interference with trade. ever, will result in the diminution of competition and in an enhancement of prices. The effect of the first portion of this B ill is directly the opposite of the American Act.

That section shows the distinction in objects between American legislation and the B ill ; may not be easily procurable the one being against enhancement of prices through artificial trade limitations, and the other against the lowering of prices through the competition is not unfair, competition assumed to be unfair. That is the language of the American Act, which, A Canadian or American as I say, is altogether different in character from the B ill before us. There is only one Act with which I am familiar which contains a provision in regard to the lowering of prices. It is a State Act which was passed in Arkansas, and it forbids any act being done which would tend to advance, reduce, or control prices, or the cost to the producer or to the consumer of any product or article. In TiedemaiVs work on State It asand Federal Control of Personal Property.

481,Mr Glynn,"Yes. TheB ill , howlaws dealing with' such matters. There, the Acts, which are directed against trusts, are chiefly State Acts. Since allusion has been made to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, I should like to refer the Attorney-General to a decision given in connection with the American Sugar Trust. In the case of the United States v. E . C. Knight, 156 US. page 1, a question arose as to the ""Federal power to control the operations of the Sugar Trust in America. As bearing upon that question, I have made the following extract from the opinion of the Court: In order to give Federal jurisdiction to aCourt to protect small producers against internal it must be held that the article does not become a part of Inter-State commerce until it has started from one State to another. «» That is a very far-reaching decision. The operation of these Acts is nearly always loca|l. easy for an internal trust to establish independent' trusts in the different States, and so evade the Federal law. know, from the broken package case in America, that when an article once gets into the stream of interchange between the States, it becomes subject to Federal control. But when its transit ceases, and the package is broken, it is no longer subject to Federal control. Consequently, I cannot see, even if we amend this Bill, how we can do more than touch the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in relation to its exchanges between the States. honourable and learned member refers, there was a dissent by Mr Justice Harlan, and his opinion, has since been upheld in the Addystone Pipe case. by all writers that the Federal jurisdiction over commerce does not begin until an article has reached the stream of interchange between the States. But after it has i reached its destination it ceases to be under Federal jurisdiction from the moment the package is broken. Consequently, the main principle which I deduce from the quotation I have given is not affected by any decision such as that to which the Attorney General has referred . Section1 of an Act1 which was passed in New York in 1893 says: Every contract or combination in the form of trusts or otherwise made after the passing of this Act, whereby the competition in the State of New York in the supply or the price of any article of common use in the said State for the support of life and health may be restrained or prevented for the purpose of advancing prices, is hereby declared illegal. Clause 10 of this B ill , which deals with restraints on trade between the States or with foreign countries, is an exceptional one. I think that it is susceptible of amendment. In adding the final words to that clause, which render it penal for a trust to do anything which may have the effect of injuring Australian industries^ we are opening up possibilities which were certainly not contemplated by the framers of 'the American legislation. In"" the earlier part of the Bill there is no provision made competition or State monopolies. These are the men who, prior to the establishment of the International Harvester Company, reduced the prices to the consumer. They areciiot protected by this B ill against the State combination, which may completely In Australia it would be ivery destroy them. We We cannot do everything. had an opportunity of judlging this B ill , they imagine that its scope really extends to the protection of all manufactures, whereas in its operation it will chiefly protect the larger men against competition, whether fair or unfair. I have no desire to trespass any further upon the attention of honourable members, but I think I have adduced some arguments whicli tell against the too hasty passing of this B ill, and against precipitate action on our part. My own feeling is that the evil has not arisen. At any rate, I would prefer to deal with the matter six months hence in the fuller light which may be shed upon it by the well-considered reI t is clearly laid down ports of the Tariff Commission. pity that a very important proposal of this kind should be brought before us at this stage of the session. The Attorney General has stated that the ideas embodied in it have been before the public for months, and that the people have been demanding a. measure of this character for some time. If honourable members will cast their minds back to the first occasion upon which an Anti-Trust Bill was promised in this Parliament, and if they will examine the measure before us, they will at once realize that a complete change has taken place in the ideas of those who asked for it .

The Government of the day, which' comprised the present Minister of Trade and Customs and the Prime Minister, promised that the Bill would be introduced at an early date. Their pledge in that connection was not fulfilled, and no attempt would have been made to deal with this question but for the fierce controversy that has arisen over the importation of harvesters. It is an unfortunate fact that the largest manufacturer of harvesters in Victoria has been able to exercise so much political influence. He has been able to exert sufficient influence to get the valuation of harvesters raised at the Customs House, and also to precipitate the introduction of^ this particular measure. I am not one of those who object to the passing of a Bill, which will deal rationally with trusts and monopolies. When Henry Demerest Lloyd, the well-known American writer upon this subject, was in Australia some years ago, I had the pleasure of many with him, and I was in possession of his books, when there were only two or three of them in the I have taken great interest in the literature bearing on American trusts, and have paid particular attention, to the question.' has agitated the public mind for some time. I venture to say that the means adopted in this Bill are not such as will adequately control local industries; on the contrary, they will increase their power. They will lead to local trusts springing up in many branches of industry in which they are at present unknown, and will press most injuriously upon the producers of Australia. I'he measure with which we are now dealing owes its origin to the harvester incident, and it is my intention to devote a few minutes to a re-statement of that matter, in order to show that many unjustifiable aspersions have been cast upon the importers of the machines. have been subjected to a great many misrepresentations. well-known Victorian senator journeyed to the Mallee and the Wimmera, and delivered an address a.t Warracknabeal, and also two lectures at Horsham, which is within my electorate, in support of the Imposition of an exceptionally heavy duty on harvesters. On the follovying Saturday the farmers of the Horsham district held a meeting to conMr Robinson. .sider the question, and only seven were in favour of his policy. That does not lead It was admitted that the one to believe that the Canadian exporters of harvesters have driven terror into the hearts of our farmers. Notwithstanding an exposition of the situation by a keen debater and an experienced orator, resolutions were passed against the imposition of an additional"" duty. I have been inundated with resolutions passed by many of my constituents, urging me to oppose any measure likely to restrict the importation of harvesters, or to increase the duty upon them. men who use them. one of those who believe that the opinions of those who use these machines should have far more weight with us than the opinions of the individuals who are brought together by the ringing of a bell in one of the suburbs, and who would probably not be able to distinguish'between a harvester and a hay rake. I have received the following letter from the Natimuk Farmers' Association: Dear Sir,I have been instructed by my assoconversations ciation to write you as their valued representative "" That this association is vigorously opposed to any additional duty being levied on harvesters, Commonwealth. and that they thoroughly appreciate your splendid work in safeguarding the farming interests, and sincerely assure you of their continued support."" ItI have referred to thiscommunication to show that the farmers of one of our important wheat-growing centres are strongly opposed to the imposition of an increased duty on harvesters. I have also received the following letter from the secretary of the Vectis East Farmers' Association, which comprises many of the men who settled on the Walmer Estate, purchased by the State Government when the honourable member for Echuca held' office as Minister of Lands, and I have no hesitation in saying that they are all of a fine type: Dear Sir,-A t the meeting of our association on the 7th inst., a motion was passed tq the effect that this association was opposed to any increase of duty on imported harvesters, and that I wish to show that they you be asked to use your influence in trying to prevent the duty from being increased. Only a few days ago a I have also received the following letter from Lower Norton, another wheat-growing centre, near Horsham : Dear Sir,I have the honour to inform you that at a representative meeting of farmers in this district, the following resolution was carried unanimously :"" That this meeting strenuously protests against any increase of duty being placed on harvesters and harvesting machinery, and that the resolution be forwarded to Mr Robinson, our membeT.""",60,Honourable Members Nothin G Of The

488,Mr Robinson,"That is so. I amI propose to read to the House the following extract from a local newspaper: > At the last meeting of the Murtoa Farmers' Association, the president, Mr Nowotna, brought forward the matter of the proposed increase of duty on harvesting machinery, and during the discussion which followed he mentioned that some years ago he had been a shareholder in the McKay Company, who used to have their machines built at a eost of about ^50 for each machine, ancl he thought that an extra duty on ""the imported article would simply keep up the price of machines without giving them a chance of choosing their own makes. He therefore moved, says the Dunmunkle Standard, "" That this association protest against a further increase of duties on such articles."" The motion was seconded by Mr Degenhardt, and carried. These letters and report's should show honourable members that there is a feeling, at all events in some parts of the country, that the agitation which has been so skilfully conducted, and so ably supported in the press, in favour of the prohibition of the importation of harvesters, should not be encouraged. It is hardly necessary for me to mention that every one of these letters was entirely unsolicited by me. Most of the resolutions were passed without my knowledge, and most of the correspondents to whom I have referred are personally unknown to me. The unfortunate individuals who are responsible for the importation of harvesters have been under a very severe fire from certain quarters since the 20th April last. On that day Mr Moore, manager for T . Robinson and Company, manufacturers of agricultural implements, carrying on business at Srottiswoode. was exMcKay gave evidence a few days later on. Since then a vigorous campaign has been conducted against the importation of harvesters, and it is a singular fact that no opportunity has been afforded the importers to put their case before the public. A t the time that the Customs Department took the extraordinary action in connection with harvesters that is now a matter of history, there was on the file of the Department the draft of a letter to be written to the MasseyHarris Company, asking for an explanation of certain matters. But some zealous individual in the Department wrote across it, in pencil, "" Hold over until Mr Smart has seen MrM c K a y ."" The letter was to remain in abeyance until the axe-grinder, Mr America arid other countries, but it was McKay, had had another opportunity to speak against the importers. The departmental action in regard to the duty on harvesters was taken without any explanation being demanded from the Massey-Harris Company. which the honourable member refers occurred before I took office. tribute blame to fhe Minister. The Department took action without asking' for any explanation from the importers, and although charges of unfair competition were made against them as far back as April last, they have not yet been afforded an opportunity to state their case before the Tariff Commission. It is true that the Commission paid them rather a back-handed compliment by suggesting that they should give evidence before it in Adelaide. Not being absolute idiots, they refused to do so. Thev urged that their evidence, like that of their opponents, should be given in Melbourne. I am now informed that in January next-afte r a lapse of nine months -the y are to be afforded an opportunity to go before the Commission in this city. I do not say that an opportunity to state their case has been wilfully denied them by the Tariff Commission. The trouble has possibly occurred owing to a faulty arrangement of work. But we are now asked to pass legislation very much in the dark, inasmuch as the importers have not had a chance to express their view of the matter. On the other hand, the campaign started by foreign competition has been conducted for many months with great skill and ability. Accusations have been hurled against the national Harvester Company, and at a time when the. public mind has been strongly inflamed by ex forte statements this Bill has been introduced. In the closing hours of the session, we are asked to agree to it , without having had an opportunity to give it reasonable and proper consideration. We have been asked to proceed with its consideration on the day following the Ministerial explanation of its provisions. The Attorney-General, striking one of his heroic attitudes, declared that the BiU was to divide the friends and foes of Australia. That being so, no one can deny its importance. I have been anxious to check it, and to compare it with the legislation of only yesterday that I was able to secure a CODV of the Sherman Act, whilst the New Zealand Act reached me only this afternoon.

Then again-questio n 16175Are you getting no more than the same rate of profit now that you did before?-Perhaps a little more. Not only have the local manufacturers not suffered, but they are doing, better than they were. Why, therefore, should the importation of harvesters be prohibited? Until quite recently, the imported machines were sold at the same price as the locally manufactured machines. Then a number of local manufacturers, headed by McKay, commenced to agitate for the prohibition of the importation of harvesters, and made a number of misleading statements in the endeavour to blacken their trade rivals. The -International Harvester Company of America, thinking that it was not good enough to persist in keeping up prices, chiefly for the benefit of McKay and Co., and be blackguarded by that firm, determined to leave the combine, and' to -sell its machines at what it thought to' be a fair profit, allowing McKay and others to shift for themselves. therefore reduced its price to .£70, which is more than has been charged by some of the -local manufacturers for a similar machine, a fact which is conclusive evidence that the operations of the company are not disastrously affecting the local makers. Moore gave evidence before the Tariff Commission that, in 1902, Martin and Company were selling stripper -harvesters at £ 6 0 a machine, and in a previous debate in this ChamberI laid on the table a telegram from a constituent of mine at Murtoa, stating that they had quoted to the Farmers' Union^ 7 0 as the price of a single harvester, with a reduction of 10 per cent, if any farmer, or combination of farmers, took three machines, which would have -brought down the price to £ 6 $ each. are free on truck. We have had a howl be thrown out of work here. That state of anguish from McKay because his profits ment was made in my electorate by Senator will be reduced if harvesters are made Trenwith, and has been made by various cheaper to the farmers; but he will still conpublic speakers throughout the suburbs. tinue, to make a good profit, and a much No statement that has been made is more larger amount than any honourable member devoid of truth. It is a gross and wicked is ever likely to make. If the present comexaggeration that has been put before the [235] petition is allowed to continue, farmers -will be able to get machines > during next year for between ^ 7 0 and ^ 7 5 , while prices will go down still lower in the future. It: has been said that the American manufacturers have pirated an Australian invention; but, as every one knows, it is impossible to lawfully use patents which are protected in this country, and McKay's exaggerated statements resolve themselves into this-that the Americans are using time-expired patents. McKay himself, however, does the same, and not a manufacturer in the world oould carry on his business if he did not use such patents. Many persons think that, as patentees have had the advantage of the designs of the brains of others, they should not be given a monopoly of any invention, and that view is held by both Socialists and individualists. While I do not agree with it , I admit that any particular patent is merely the culminating result of the efforts of many men, through, perhaps, many centuries. McKay, in the manufacture of his machines, uses timeexpired patents-American, English, and Australian-and , if that is piracy, he is as much guilty of the crime as is the International Harvester Company. The word, however, is an improper one to use in this connection. Every manufacturer is at It liberty to use time-expired patents, and no more blame is attachable to an American firm for doing so than is to be laid to the door of H . V. McKay and Company. I could, if it were relevant, show the House that a certain firm of manufacMr turers in this city which has been calling out for the prohibition of imported harvesters were once agents for some American machines disc harrows, I think and copied those machines so faithfully that certain private marks of the American company were repeated on the copies. by the B ill ? that the charge of piracy should not be made by some of those who utter it so glibly and so frequently.

Mr Moore repliedApproximately, If the industry, would provide for an average wage of only .£50. face of it, is absurd. employees person engaged in the manufacture of agricultural implements, of whatever kind, and only a fraction of the number would be employed solely in the production of harvesters. Yet the public have been told that -3,000 men would be thrown out of employment, unless the importation of foreign harvesters was prohibited. are indicative of the means which have been adopted to inflame the public mind on this question. They exhibit a reckless disregard of the truth. So far from the local industry having been crushed, Ave find that there is a very considerable export of locally manufactured Minister was good enough to inform me that over 400 locally-made harvesters had been exported during the current year. I have no doubt that these figures represent .a large increase upon the export of a few years ago, and an industry which is capable ""of assuming such proportions cannot be said to require much spoon-feeding at the hands of the Legislature. ( There may be reasons why tlje Americans can produce machines more cheaply than can the local manufacturers, but it must not be forgotten that, inclusive of the Customs duty of ^5 machine, the cost of bringing a harvester from Toronto to Melbourne amounts to £20. The local manufacturers enjoy the full benefit of this enormous protection. objection to that, but I am strongly opposed to a man who enjoys a privilege of that kind-a mers can have extended to them-seeking to further exploit our producers. ject of this Bill is to exclude all competition, and if that result were brought about, there would be nothing to prevent half-adozen or a dozen firms in from raising their prices as high as they chose. state that their object is to. prevent the importation of harvesters. be impossible to discuss this without raising the fiscal issue. My objection to the proposal of the Government lies Mr Robinson. in the'fact that they are proposing to empower the Minister to exercise powers in regard tp the imposition of duties and the prohibition of imports which should be left entirely in the hands of Parliament. All ^'160,000. the Minister has to do is to go to the 3,000 persons employed in the Comptroller-General, and say to him, as alleged, that amount "" McKay has been biting my ear, and wants annual the importation of harvesters prohibited."" That, on the The Comptroller-General would look into The 3,000 the matter, and decide upon ex parte statereferred to includes every ments that a primd facie case had been made out. Then the Minister would appoint a Board, of which the honourable member for members, and upon their making their report, the Minister could go to the Cabinet, and with their approval, either prohibit the importation of the harvesters, or subject These statements them to a duty of 1^25 or ^ 5 0 per machine. Only a few days ago, honourable members refused to permit the Minister to exercise any such power in regard'to the duties on metals and machinery undor division VI . A of the Tariff. Thev decided that the duties should be imharvesters Recently the posed only by resolution of both Houses, and I am 'glad: to say that honourable members of the Labour Party took a firm attitude on'that question. Customs duties should be increased only by Parliament, acting in the f u l l light of day. If the B ill were passed the only way in'which Parliament could override the decision of the Government would be by turning Ministers out of office. There are many reasons, apart from fiscal considerations, which influence honourable members in supporting a Government, and many of them might prefer per to submit fo what they considered to be an injustice rather than turn a Ministry out of office. If the Bill reaches the Committee stage I trust that we shall take care fo I have no provide that no duty shall be increased or prohibition imposed without the consent of Parliament. I would go so far, in the privilege which none of our far.interests of expedition, as to make the action of the Cabinet subject merely to a resoluThe obtion of both Houses of Parliament. Those who are asking our protection should show us that they are prepared to accord some privileges to those in whose interests they Australia profess to be taking action. I should be prepared to support a provision under which The manufacturers openly no employer who seeks to prohibit competing imports would be able to place himIt would self beyond the control of the Wages question Boards. Before a man could come to Parliament and ask for a special privilege, or",64,Honourable Members Nothin G Of The
502,Melbourne Ports And Mr Mckay Might Be,"even before he approached the Minister and asked for a searching inquiry, he should be called upon to show that he was paying the union or standard rate of wage and employing his men for only eight hours daily. wishes us to prohibit imports which compete with his products should show that he has clean hands. He should not ask for special advantages at the expense of our producers, the majority of whom are exposed to the competition of the Indian ryots, the Egyptian fellaheen, and the products of the cheap laws of the United States and Canada, unless he can show that he is paying the full union rate of wage. He should""show, further, that he is not making an excessive profit!. I am sure that honourable members would not agree to the restriction of imports if it were found that the local manufacturers were underpaying their employees, and were at the same time making such profits as would enable them to pay a good rate of wage after making allowance for a fair return on the capital they had invested. I do not object to the manufacturer making even a very good profit, but I have no sympathy with the man who, in spite of the fact that he is making thousands of pounds per annum, squeals as if only a copper stood between him and destitution. Some of the manufacturers have been very glad to obtain the support of honourable members in connection with contentious proposals such as those embodied in the Trade Marks Bill, but. so far as I am concerned, they will bft called upon to give something in return for any privilege they may obtain at our hands in connection with the exclusion of imports. They will ha.ve to show that they are not merely talking with their tongues in their cheeks when they say that they are prepared to maintain a fair rate of wage. They will have to furnisfi genuine, proof that they are treating their men properly. I should like to refer to the unfair treatment which is meted out to the two different classes of persons against whom the provisions of the Bill are directed. I am one of those who believe that the fact that a man is an importer furnishes no reason why he should not receive fair play. He should be treated with as much consideration as if he were a. manufacturer. I would ask honourable members to contrast the treatment which in meted out to importers, under clause 4. with that which it is proposed to extend to local trusts under clauses 10 [ 3S]2 2 and 11. The importers are to have their caseo submitted to a political Board, whereas local trusts have to be proceeded against by ordinary methods of prosecution, or the Attorney-General has to take proAny man who ceedings to obtain an injunction. In a case of prosecution some one will have to stand the racket of instituting proceedings in the Police Court, and if there is a committal! the defendant will have the advantage of appearing before a Judge and jurv, and of"" having his case conducted by a skilful advocate. He will have his case adjudicated 5 upon by a judicial tribunal, whereas the importer will be called upon to appear before a political Board appointed by the Minister. Under certain circumstances, the importer will have no opportunity to do anything, because the case w ill ' be assumed against him. It is provided in clause 4» (1) Competition shall be deemed to be unfair if(a) under ordinary circumstances of trade it would probably lead to the Australian goods being either withdrawn from the market or sold at a loss unless produced at a lower remuneration for labour. ' That may mean anything. A dozen different meanings may be attached to it. What the ""ordinary circumstances of trade"" are is a question upon which the seventy-five members of this House would express a dozen different opinions. It is to be decided not by a judicial, but by a political tribunal, which is bound to bu of a partisan character. Then subclause 2 provides that competition shall be deemed to be unfair, unless the contrary is proved, if the person importing goods, or selling imported goods, is a commercial trust. How will that provision operate? The kerosene supplv of the world is practically obtained from two companies-the Standard Oil Company, and the British Shale Transport and Trading Company. One of these firms is a trust, and the other an enormously wealthy company. Under the operation of the Dibbs Tariff, kerosene used to be manufactured in New South Wales. A duty of 6d. per gallon was imposed upon that article, to assist in the establishment of the industry. Will it be possible under this Bill for a manufacturer who may possibly produce enough kerosene to light the houses in one small suburb of Sydney, to approach the Minister and say: "" I cannot carry on operations in the face of the competition of these powerful companies. I therefore ask you to impose a prohibitive duty upon kerosene in order that I may make a ""fair profit out ,of the industry?"" the result being that the price of the article will be raised from one corner of Australia to the other. he could supply the kerosene, as it was -wanted. that is possible under this Bill. Are we going to refuse light to residents in the back blocks because a commercial trust for which we are not responsible has control of the -kerosene supply ? It appears to me that if the matter be followed to its logical conclusion, the case which I have cited is one -which the provisions of this Bill fit to a nicety. There are other examples, which show what an extraordinarily drawn measure this is. If an importer gives too large a remuneration to his travellers, that may constitute an inducement to the Minister to certify that the competition is unfair. Another provision of the Bill states that an importer cannot purchase a cheap lot of goods abroad, because competition shall be deemed to be unfairi f the imported goods have been purchased abroad of articles which have recently appeared in at prices greatly below their ordinary cost of production where produced, or market price where purchased. That means that it would be within the power of the Minister to prevent the importation of any line of goods which were sold off in any part of the world. Honourable members who have had the misfortune to invest a few pounds in mining, know that many a mine has been able to carry on successfully by purchasing machinery from a claim that has proved a "" duffer."" Yet any goods imported under similar circumstances would be liable to be "" held up"" at the whim of the Minister and his precious. Board. ' On the other hand, the way is paved so nicely for the local trusts that it is practically impossible for them to come under the operations of the Bill. Colonial Sugar Refining Company will not be affected by it. vision in the Bill which will have the effect of preventing the formation of a local combine? bers will refer fo the Sherman Act they will see that it contains a general provision that contracts in restraint of trade are void. That Statute also embodies a section, the significance of which is striking. It sets 'out that any person who does any of these acts either on his own account, or in combination with others, shall be guilty of a wrong, and may be punished in certain ways. But under the Bill one manufacturer may control the supply of a certain article throughout a State or throughout the Commonwealth, and yet he will not be affected by its provisions. The Sherman Act mikes it unlawful for a man to commit acts which, under this measure, are not unlawful unless they are committed in conjunction with other persons. We are therefore holding out inducements to individuals to act, by a secret understanding, in restraint of trade. In fhe Sherman Act the fact that a person endeavours to monopolize any part of trade or commerce in restraint of trade is in itself an offence. That provision is based upon a sound principle. The object of the Sherman Acts ; to carry out Inter-State free-trade, and to allow commerce to flow from State to State in the most practicable manner. Many honourable members have doubtless read a series MicClure's Magazine and Everybody's Magazine in reference to the trusts in America. There is no doubt that those articles have rendered a great service to the United States, and have supplied the rest of the world with a vast amount of information. I should like honourable members who are interested in this matter to turn to a coupleof articles dealing with the oil trust which were written by Miss Ida Tarbell, and which were published in McClure's Magazine about two months ago. There they will see the reason why Congress legislation has taken the course that it has taken. Its object is to make trade between the States as free as possible. The author of those articles points out that if the pipe lines were common carriers, and all producers of oil could take advantage of them just as they can of the railwayI t is admitted that the lines, the growth of this enormous monopoly would lie very materially 'checked. In some cases the growth of these monopolies has ( been due to the operation of the Tariff, 'and in others to the private ownership of natural monopolies-for example, the unrestricted ownership of railways, which has vested the railway companies there with power to make crushing distinctions between individuals.

This Bill contains no far-reaching proposal of that kind. On the contrary, it contains a provision which will confer on the Minister power to increase the Tariff without reference to Parliament. The only remedy for an abuse of that power that we possess is the power to turn him out of office. Many of the biggest trusts in Australia will not be. touched by this measure. a number of companies forming themselves into a single company instead of into a trust ? there is no provision to prevent a number of companies combining to form a single company. For instance, there is nothing to prevent a number of leather companies from forming themselves into an Amalgamated Leather Company Limited, or to prevent the manufacturers from taking shares in the new concern. learned member read fhe Northern Securities case in America-the Merger case? deal in reference to it, and I do not think the Attorney-General will be able to apply it to a company in which the persons interested take their payment in shares. In such circumstances, it is quite possible for individuals to sell out and leave no trace of their original deal. But under the Sherman legislation, I believe, they could be reached in another way. difficult to catch them. very difficult to catch them. Nevertheless, the attempt should be made. I have never regarded the operations of trusts with unconcern. I have always believed that legislation should be enacted to control them. I go further, and I say that in Australia we enjoy many advantages which will tend to prevent the undue creation of trusts, if Parliament is only watchful. But under the provisions of this B ill , if we do not create trusts, we shall call into being all the evilsattendant upon them, and that without benefiting the public. It is not my intention to delay honourable members by speaking at greater length. I crave the not inconsistent with his statement. The literature of America indulgence of the House .for the somewhat disjointed nature of my remarks. Mr -WATSON (Bland) I am one of those who have thought for a considerable' time that there is great necessity to .deal with what is perhaps the most outstanding feature of modern industrialism. The concentration of capital, its accumulation, and its greater power to-day, as compared with' a few years ago, have led to developments in industrial organization that have been recognised by every inquirer into social events throughout the world. It is increasingly evident that, whether by State or any other form of Socialism, or whether by restrictive legislation, society will be compelled, in the ordinary march of events, to take some steps to curb the increasing power which is being vested in the hands of the few by the vast accumulation of capital, and by the better organization of industrial forces. I am far from denying that some forms of trusts or combinations of capital act in a most beneficent way. There can be no doubt that better organization leads, in the first instance, to economy of production and distribution. Nor can there the honourable and be any doubt that by forming a trust any set of producers, manufacturers, or others can produce more cheaply, and put their I have read a good goods on the market more economically,, than they can when they are competing with each other, and absorbing a great deal of energy and money in keeping their goods before the market, and maintaining useless stocks. That is a truism that is recognised to-day all the world over. Modern methods tend in that direction, and it is useless to expefct that Australia, any more than the rest of the world, will escape from It would be very all the evils which, in the present condition of society, follow in the train of irresponsible power. I was glad to hear the I admit that it is honourable and learned member for Wannon say, towards the close of his speech, that he believed in the public ownership of public utilities. That is a doctrine that the Labour Party, and a number who do not belong to that body, have been trying, for many years to instil in the minds of the community. But I was under the impression, in view of the campaign upon which the honourable and learned member's leader has entered, that private enterprise was to be the feature of the future, so far* as Australia was concerned.",67,Honourable Members Nothin G Of The

Surely the Opposition must see that when such a condition of affairs is reached, one of two courses must be taken. Either legislation of this kind must be introduced, with the object of returning to the public some control, and of securing to them some chance of receiving the benefit of competition; or, on the other hand, the community must step in and, in some form or other, resume the industries, and work them for the public benefit.

However, I do not wish to again discuss that matter. It seems to me that we are paying for the refining of our sugar nearly double the amount that we should be called upon to contribute if anything like fair methods were followed. If that be so, it is clear that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is operating against the publie interest. The Attorney-General said that he did not think that the company would come within the purview of this B ill . it would come within the definition of commercial trusts. fining Company would operate within a single State, and, therefore, the Bill would not affect it . learned member is mistaken. The company's products are transferred from one State to another, and its operations would clearly come within the scope of the B ill . duct to a man in the State in which it was operating, and he could distribute it to other people elsewhere. that would place the company beyond the scope of the B ill , if we thought fit to include it in the definition of ""trust."" One honourable and learned member assured me that the definition of "" commercial trust,"" as set forth in the B ill , would allow of a single. company being brought within its purview, if it was acting detrimentally to the public interests. That is to say, the definition of ""commercial t r u s t "" is wide enough to include a single company which can be proved to have done something in restraint of trade, and to the detriment of the public. If the B ill does not so provide, it should, in my View, be made to do so. We should be able to summon the company before the bar of public opinion, and subject its operations to some sort of examination, in order to assure' ourselves that the community is not being junfairly treated. In my opinion, the company is not treating the community well, but if it can demonstrate the contrary, I shall have no further cause of quarrel with it. If the Bill does not clearly indicate that the company will be affected, we should! amend it. Some reference has been made to the I have referred to the local harvester trust.' In my view, a combination which keeps the price of harvesters up to ;£8o per machine-or , as it was until recently, £ 9 0 per machine-is not treating the users fairly. The price of the machines should be reduced to considerably less 'than , £ 8 0 . Of course, it is said-and there may be some truth in the statement-that the methods of pushing business adopted by their competitors from America, who have been able to spend more money than the business was worth for the time being, have forced our manufacturers to incur a similarly laige expenditure, which, of course, has been added to the cost of the machines. If that be the case, it only argues that our manufacturers must, in the interests of the consumers, organize their business on such lines that they will be able to sell the machines to the public at a price representing a fair advance on the cost of production.

I contend that if the Minister appoints the Board, he will be placed in a false position, and would be open to all kinds of imputations of unfairness in regard to matters of great importance^ If a free trade Minister were in power, and he hap-pened to select a majority of free-traders, there would be an immediate outcry from the protectionists that they were not'receiving fair play. Similarly, if a protectionist Minister were to appoint a majority of protectionists, a like outcry would be made by the other side. Therefore, in the interests of the Minister himself, and especially in the interests of the public, who have a right to know upon unimpeachable authority what are the facts, it is highly desirable that no one of less standing than a Judge of the Supreme Court, or a Justice of the High Court, should conduct an inquiry of the description contemplated. In Canada, as has been pointed out, the Tariff provisions with resoect to trusts enable an inquiry to be held, but it must be conducted by a Judge of the Supreme Court. In answer to the statement put forward by the Minister, that His Honour the President of the Arbitration Court felt that he would not care to undertake work of a semi-political character, I may say that the Judges of every Supreme Court in Australia, at one time or another, undertake, as Royal Commissioners, work of a character similar to that held in view.

Some time ago I expressed the view that the work of the Court would increase to such an extent that an additional Justice would be necessary. I was prepared, in the meantime, to vote for the appointment of three Justices only, with a view to ascertaining what the work would really amount to. It is being demonstrated more clearly every day that the work is growing to such an extent that we shall have to reconsider the matter. Therefore, the suggestion that a Justice of the High Court would not be able to find time for this work may be put aside. I think that Ministers should consider whether; there should not be some preliminary inquiry in regard to local combines before the Attornev-General takes action-jus t as is provided for before the Minister takes action in regard to imports. My own position is absolutely tentative, but it occurred to me that an inquiry might be held before we force on the Attorney-General the duty of taking action in the manner proposed. to force him.

I am quite at one with the Prime Minister. But the experience of anti-trust legislation in America is that there is considerable doubt as to how far it can be made effective. Because of that doubt, there is the greater need for us to pick our steps carefully, so that when the Bill is passed it will achieve its purpose.

With regard to the importation of harvesters, which is a matter of pressing importance, nothing is likely to be done within the next six months. The Sherman member think that the harvester trust people should be heard before action is taken ? should be investigated, and I would have it Amending legislation has since been inquired into before Parliament reassembles next year.

I cordially approve of this attempt to limit in some way the reoperation of trusts and combines.

At the same time, whilst the livelihood of hundreds of native-born Australians are in jeopardy as the result of the operations of outside trusts and combinations, this Parliament should not prorogue without doing something for them. I believe that it is our duty, notwithstanding the feelings of my honourable friends in Opposition, to take action. We have a duty to perform, and as a labour protectionist I shall stand by any Bill of this character. In the United States, the trusts are stronger than the Government, and one of the greatest Presidents since George Washington has been fighting them for the past three years. But what has he accomplished? Absolutely nothing. The same thing will happen in this country if we do not legislate against it . I am satisfied that this Bill is the forerunner of Socialism. We have only one hope left. M.r. Bryan, who will be in Australia in the course of a few months, wrote to President Roosevelt some time ago as follows:You have the contest of your life before you, and I desire to render you all the assistance in my power. The railway companies will try to persuade you; if they fail in this they will try to scare you. If they fail in this also, they will try to defeat your recommendations. embarrass you to have strong party leaders ngainst you. You may even be embarrassed by having so, many party leaders against you that even the democrats may co-operate with you. Btt be firm. I trust that the Government will insist upon pushing this Bill through. Let us place it ' upon the statute-book. just as f u l l of rings, trusts, and combinations as the United States is' f u l l of boodlers and ""boodleiers,"" and in proportion to their size the former are the more venomous. These trusts are a government to themselves. Why should we be afraid to of the session before Christmas, let us reassemble early next year for the purpose of enacting legislation to prevent the: destruction of our industries. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Min ister of Trade and Customs) I have listened attentively to some very able speeches which have been delivered to-day. I was specially interested' in the utterance of the honourable meniber for Bland, who always makes a good speech when he deals with matters of this kind. I desire to say that it was not the wish of the Government to include in this Bill provision for I am more fit to be in the hospital the appointment of a Board. It was their intention, in the first instance, to appoint a Judge in lieu of that body. In regard to the appointment of the President of the Arbitration Court, to whom reference was made by the honourable member for Bland, I wish to say that an attempt was made to obtain his services for the position, but he did not coasider he had time in conjunction with his othen duties; if , however, it is possible for that gentleman to fill the position, nobody would be more delighted than the Government, and I am confident that nobody would fill it better than Mr Justice O'Connor. Had we been able to appoint the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court to deal with these matters, I should have been relieved of a very great responsibility in administering this measurea responsibility that I have no desire to have cast upon me. I have mentioned this matter merely to show that it was not the desire of the Government to refrain from providing that these questions should be dealt with by a Judge, but that, in the circumstances, we were compelled to provide for the appointment of a Board. The position of the Commonwealth is different' from that occupied by New Zealand, since It will it consists of six. States, whilst New Zealand is a separate Colony. Had we been in the same position, no doubt we should have been able to select certain responsible persons, as has, been done there, to carry out fhis Work.

Question so resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee : Clause1 (Short Title). the feeling of the Committee on the question whether or not it is wise to proceed further with this Bill at the present time by movingThat the clause be postponed. I am strongly opposed to all trusts that are calculated to injuriously affect the people. I hold that we should have a law dealing with combines who send their goods to Australia, as well as with local combinations; but I am anxious to see a B ill passed that will be in every way effective. We have been told that the anti-trust legislation of the United States has proved a failure, and, that being so, we should endeavour to profit by the experience of that country. seems to me that by postponing the further consideration of this Bill until next session we shall be enabled to make it more effective. The honourable member for Darwin spoke of the failure of the anti-trust law of the United States to cope with the conditions created by the beef trust, and it seems to me that he furnished a strong argument for the postponement of this measure. Some remarks have been made as to the delay in bringing it forward. It must not be forgotten, however', that the Government took office shortly after the opening of the session, and consequently did not enjoy the advantage of a recess in which to prepare the necessary measures for our consideration. Nevertheless, we have been kept closely at work, and our record of legislation is better than is that of any previous session. .As we are likely to meet again in a few months, I think we may well delay the consideration of this measure until then. That will not only enable us to give further attention to it , but will afford the people of Australia an opportunity to become fully seized of its purport. So far, most of the people of the Commonwealth have not learned of its provisions. I do not suppose that a copy of the Bill has yet reached the State of whicb I . am a representative, and whilst I am 3 protectionist, I wish to fairly represent the free-traders in my constituency, and to give them an opportunity to express their views in regard to it. It would be much better if all Bills were circulated throughout Australia a few weeks before we are called upon to deal with them. We are legislating, not for a small State over which the mails can be distributed daily, but for a vast continent, and we should, therefore, give the people ample time to learn the effect of the measures with which we are called upon to deal. I am not blaming the Government for having introduced this Bill so late in the session. They have undoubtedly done good work. I recognise that they have succeeded in passing many measures, but I am extremely anxious that a Bill for the preservation of Australian industries shall be a thoroughly effective one. It is only because of that desire that I have been induced to submit this motion. If it be the intention of the Commitlee to deal with the Bill this session, I hope that the discussion will be brief and to the point. But, on the other hand, if the majority of honourable members support my motion, I trust that the Government will take it as an indication that, in our opinion, the further consideraIt tion of the Bill should be delayed until next session. ternal Affairs) I hope that the Committee will not accept this motion, because, whilst I recognise the extreme friendliness with which it has been submitted, and the fairness of many arguments that could be used in its favour, it does not appear to me that in taking this course we shall be serving the best interests of the country we represent. time to consider the B ill . that the strain upon honourable members has been severe.

612,Mr Deakin,"I admit that, and grantbe overlooked in this case, since the bulk of the House appears to be at one in regard to the importance of the question and the greatness of the principle at stake. This is no new departure from my point of view. I have always regarded measures of this sort as amongst the most necessary safeguards in modern industrial legislationas inseparable from the commercial developments that have taken place of recent years in civilized countries. Parliaments have either to face them in defence of the people whom they represent, or to consent to the passing of their powers into the control of the great financial corporations that are becoming a menace to the general prosperity and to the stability of democratic institutions. As soon as the first Adminisstration of which I was the head began work, we took up the task where it had been left by my then colleague, the right honourable member for Adelaide, and proceeded to frame a Trust Bill which should deal both with aggression from abroad and the possible growth of local capitalistic combinations. of the old world and the new has shown that if financial magnates are left to their own devices, under unrestricted competition, modern developments have worked such a transformation that what were at one time the characteristic conditions of "" a fair field and no favour "" have now become the conditions of the gravest tyranny of modern times. Experience has shown that it was a necessity that in the growth of industrialism there should be a time during which individual expansion was absolutely uncontrolled, and then a period when combination was recognised and authorized by law, with many beneficial results. But it was not then .realized, as it has since been discovered, that corporate power and authority, with its distribution of responsibility and Ms concentration of the power of money, might become a serious dangeT. It has become a danger so great that there are now to be found'intelligent and well-informed men who -.are asking themselves whethisr the limited liability principle, upon which present-day operations so much depend, is not tending to work more injury than it is now working good. It has become clear that, if it is to be retained, it will have to be restrained-that the responsibility that has been evaded by its being divided into almost infinitesimal morsels will have to be restored to all corporations, and that, unless the State is prepared to see itself dispossessed by a larger power, it must exercise the authority it now enjoys to assert its primacy on behalf of the people. I do not intend to enter even upon an outline of the history of the development of the great modern trusts whose tentacles are visible in all directions, or to say a word more than is necessary to the consideration of this particular proposal. But I wish to point out to the Committee that the trust peril is not of our seeking. Its imminence has been forced upon us, not only by these general considerations, which I now dismiss, but by the fact that, as protectionists, and as men who aim at industrial justice, we have to deal with an invasion from abroad which, through our Customs law, brings us face to face with trusts and their deceptive tactics. What is their method of working ? A trust does not consist simply of a manufacturer, or a company, or a combination of manufacturers; nor does it consist only of a number of companies making goods of the same kind. If The experience both it did, it would be comparatively easy to deal with. But, as the experience bf the United States has shown, a trust may include the company that mines raw ore, another company that manufactures it, a third company beyond it which sells the perfected article, a railroad company that transports it, an insurance company that insures it, and the steamers of accompany that conveys fhe product fronT'place to place. That being so, how are we, in administering the Customs law of Australia, to endeavour to levy a duty upon the fair market value at the port of shipment of the product of a trust ? How are we to arrive at that value named in our law when we are dealing with a trust that in one or more of its agencies alters its manufacturing charges, its freight charges, its shipping and insurance charges, as it pleases? How is it possible for the Customs to discover by ordinary methods what is the' fair market value of the products of such a combination? That is the actual problem we have to face. vernment set out to ascertain it. confronted at the Customs by trusts the fair market value of Avhose products has to be ascertained amid entirely novel complexities, in a manner for which we have no precedents.

It would be better that we should meet again after Christmas, and sit as long as is necessary, giving the measure the consideration which it deserves, than that we should go away without having dealt with it. The Bill has been caricatured both inside and -outside this Chamber, and we must submit to that, but, in itself, it is a simple meaof trusts, which are abnormal. They could sure.

The Government can then acton the finding of that -tribunal. It must be remembered that the Government must take full responsibility for everything which is done under the measure. It will act with its life in its hands, -conscious that it must answer to Parliament and to the constituencies. If the inquiry shows that the impression that competition was unfair was a mistaken one, if suspicion is discovered proved, no injury will be done, beyond the causing of inconvenience incidental to the probing into the circumstances of particular firms. The prohibition that may be used, if unfair competition is proved, is not the prohibition of all goods of a certain kind imported from abroad, but the prohibition of the goods of particular companies or corporations which are so linked together as to form a trust. It is aimed at a redressing of the balance^ so as to put fair importers on the same level, and to do justice to all Australian industries. the simplicity of the measuie is that it took two months to draff. then draft.

The Attorney-General was very anxious to secure the appointment of the Tariff Commission, which is now investigating, among other things, the condition of the iron industry, and the influence exerted upon it by the operations of foreign trusts. Yet we are being asked to pass this Bill without having the results of that investigation before us. Surely, we are entitled fo know what is the finding of the Commission. If the matter is one of urgency, why has not the Commission, which comprises a number of protectionist honourable members, brought forward its report? It seems to me very much as if those who were engaged in the agricultural implement industry were rather afraid of the result of the inquiry conducted by the Commission, and that they wanted to force the House into taking action which would not be justified if the full facts were made known. That is one of the reasons why I view this Bill with suspicion. I want more information with regard to it, before I commit mvself to supporting it. I hope that time will be given to the public, and to those who would be specially affected by the Bill, to fully consider it'in all its bearing. I would recommend the Government to postpone its further consideration for the present, so that it mav be dealt with at a later stage, when the result of the inquiries made by the Tariff Commission are before us. If the report of the Commission justifies such a course, the Government should ask honourable members to meet early next year, and deal with the matter. cumstances surrounding the Bill, I cannot support it. understand why honourable members should quently we could have considered the genehesitate to go on with the Bill. can be only one explanation, and that is being rushed into legislation which the that they are anxious to get away into Minister of Trade and Customs himself recess.

The measure is a simple one, and its purpose is quite clear. It confers upon the authorities certain powers of investigation, which If the measure is of such will relieve the Minister of Trade and Cussome of the necessity of taking action such as that for which he was recently denounced. I shall certainly support the Prime Minister in his desire to proceed with the Bill this session. If he does not do so, I trust that we shall meet during the first week of January for the purpose of dealing with this very important question. it is desirable to adjourn the discussion of this measure.

Surely he should assist to pass legislation of this character. MightI suggest to the Prime Minister that, if we cannot pass this Bill this session, we should proceed with other work, and have a special session in January for the purpose of dealing with the question. I regard this as the most important Bill that has been submitted for our consideration during the current session. What have we to fear ? Eveni f the Bill were carried in a form which was far from perfect, does anybody suggest that harm would result? What Statute is perfect? If we approved of this Bill at fhe .present time, the Government would have an opportunity during the recess of formulating a better measure, the merits of which would appeal to every honourable member.

Within what possible hope should we have of get the past few davs I was visited by an old schoolmate of mine one of manv who have lost their positions as the result of the operations of this harvester trust.

No Court that desires to carry on its business expeditiously would willingly permit two parties, unless they showed themselves to have the competence of counsel, to conduct their own cases. . Therefore, the Committee may assume that the High Court would in every case require the parties to be represented. The clauses provide that one suitor may recover from the other costs amounting to £ 1 0 0 . I would ask honourable members whether they consider that that is a condition that ought to exist? I pleaded for the High Court, because I considered that it was an eminently superior, and more impartial tribunal than a Committee of _the House. But we know very well that parties can appear before an Elections and Qualifications Committee without incurring any costs. I want honourable members to see where these clauses will lead them. They would expose the poor candidate, who might fail in his suit, on account of the neglect of some electoral officer, to the risk of having to pay £ 1 0 0 ; likely to arise they will permit them to and as no Court would undertake to hold an inquiry without ordering the suitors to be represented, there is every chance of that amount being incurred. move that clause 48 be recommitted for the purpose of amending it by providing that in future tribunals for the hearing of election disputes shall consist of Members of Parliament. petent for the honourable member to take that course on the motion for the adoption of the report of the Committee. to thank the Minister for having introduced the clause. more than kept his word. however, rest content, but shall, at the first opportunity, endeavour to take all these inquiries out of the jurisdiction of the High Court. suitors in election disputes should be put to the expense of even £ 1 0 0 .

I am afraid that under the conditions spoken of by the honourable and learned member for Parkes, the costs as between lawyer and client would be just as great as at present. wood had to pay his own costs, and also the costs of the honourable member for Riverina, which amounted to £ 2 5 1 . is slightly in error. should like to know whether, in the event of my going before the High Court, I would be permitted to plead my own case? be engaged only in the event of both parties consenting, or upon the Court certifying that counsel were necessary. port the proposal of the honourable member for Wilmot. clause will make some difference, because if discretion is vested in the Court, the result will probably be that where facts only are involved they may dispense with counsel, and that where matters of law are appear.

I urge honourable memWe know bers not to accept the amendment, for in the light of my own experience, I think that the presiding Justice would sometimes find it invaluable to have counsel appearing. By passing the clause as it If we hacl an Elections stands,, we shall, in effect, exclude counsel from the Court in relation to the consideration of questions of fact. Practically, this will be simply a Court of investigation. I ask honourable membeis to consider the position of the parties themselves. A litigant might have a very complicated and difficult question of law to face, or awkward points raised by an astute opponent. Besides, I ask the Committee to remember the absolute helplessness of some persons, even in appearing before a Committee of Elections and Qualifications.

Moreover, I ask the Committee not to do the Court the injustice of depriving it of the assistance which is essential if we are to have sound decisions on important questions of law.

That Committee not being composed of legal men, there might have been some reason for giving it legal assistance; but surely a properly qualified Judge should be able to decide cases coming before him without the help of counsel.' Of course, if all the parties wish to employ counsel, I have no objection to that being done, but I hope that the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne will be carried.

This afternoon the Attorney-General made a statement, to which I desire to refer. I understood him to say that the International Harvester Company had sent put a communication to their clients, in which they stated that they would sell one har[2,37]2 -ester at £ 7 0 , two at £ 6 0 each, and three at .£50 each. I communicated with them; and they have assured me that the statement is incorrect. to the fact that there is not a quorum present. [Quorum formed.'] eral informs me that he did not make that statement, and I am quite prepared to accept his assurance. The company affirm that they have made no such offer., and that the following is the latest circular which they have sent out to their clients:545-547 Bourke-street, Melbourne, Octobei 9th, 1905. Dear Sir,-We have decided to reduce our prices on stripper harvester from this date to the following :Cash on starting, Z70. March ist, 1906, ,£73. Half March 1, '06, and half March 1, '07, £ 7 7 .

The company have made no offer for job lots. They have never authorized anybody to offer any machine at the prices to which I have previously referred. a month ago I was shown a letter in this ment of the Attorney-General. Whether that letter was authentic, I have no means of knowing, but it purported to be authentic. How far it stated the facts, I do not know. saw a letter which was written by some up-country person in Victoria, in which I think my memory serves me rightly offered one of these machines new for £60, and that terms could be given him at that price. I have here a copy of a letter which I will read to the House. I will read it, signature and all, but I wish to say that I did not state that the letter to which I referred was written by the International Harvester Company. The following is the letter:MrH . V.
