On by way of amendmentThat the item be reduced by 10s., and that this be taken as an instruction to the Government to reconsider the Estimates for the purpose of reducing the total expenditure from revenue by the sum of £2,817,108, the amount of the anticipated deficit, in order to square the ledger.

One would assume from it that the right honourable gentleman classed economy with extravagance. I am satisfied, however, that when he wants money he goes not to the spendthrift b u t to the economist. There is much difference between economy and extravagance. It was suggested by the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) that our Leaderi n submitting his amendment represented only what he termed the extreme section of the Country party. I want to assure the Committee that he is representing every member of this party, and that we are perfectly sincere in our desire. This is not the first time that an effort has been made by us to secure economy in the ad1921-22. ministration of the finances of the Commonwealth. The amendment was well considered before submission, and. we realized to the fullest extent the responsibility that we were taking in putting it before the Committee. Our desire is that honourable members generally will realize f u l l y their responsibilities in respect of it . ference of opinion as to the direction in which economies should be made. members, however, have to reply to only their constituents. We may be wrong in the suggestionwe are bringing forward, but we feel we are f u l l y justified in submitting the question to the Committee, and we ask the Government to give us that economy which we conceive to be absolutely necessary.

""We must, however, have constitutional government, and I think that every member is of that opinion. During the war we were quite prepared to permit the Government to undertake responsibilities without conferring with Parliament. tirely different; and, in my opinion, every member of the Parliament should insist that we return to that system of government we enjoyed prior to the Avar. ¥ e require, secondly, economic administration. I am sure that there is not a member of the Country party who would for one moment declare that public works shall cease to be carried out; but we recognise the fact that for many years there has been no economy in the administration of the affairs of Australia. There has been extravagance, not only so far as Parliament is concerned, but amongst the public generally, and it behoves us, as the representatives of the people, to give a lead. We have heavy debts to finance, and we have made promises to the soldiers which require large sums in order that they may be carried out to the very letter. To that end we demand that there shall be economy in administration, and an immediate stoppage of the present extravagance. I regretted to observe the attitude of the Prime Minister when^the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) was submitting his amendment. honourable member may be somewhat of a novice here-he has not had a long parliamentary experience; but I venture to say that there are very few members who have been here only for the dura-, tion of his term who could have dealt with the subject in the same terms, and shown such a grasp of the facts, as he did. a few errors, but they are errors which any one might make under the circumstances. could take up the Budget and deliver an address showing how economies could be effected, and quote figures so full of intricate details, without Mr Gregory.

It is extremely difficult to understand how the Treasury officials frame the figures; they do not adopt the same methods as those adopted by the ordinary commercial man.

No doubt, when a> Tariff has just been altered, and when a country is suffering the usual bad times that follow a war, it is very difficult for auy Treasurer to correctly estimate the revenue he is likely to receive; and the right honourable gentleman ought to remember that last year's estimate of the Customs revenue was very much out. It is quite possible that it will be equally as much out on the other side this year. for being as much out the other way as we were last year. ing w it h the Estimates for the Taxation Department, I hope that f u l l consideration will be given to the position of certain oil companies. I trust that the Treasurer wil l let honourable members know exactly how these companies stand, because it appears that one of them, which has been doing two-thirds of its business in Australia, has paid no taxation bo the Commonwealth, while another, which has been doing only about one-third of the total business of the Commonwealth, has been obliged to pay very heavily. I have all the papers w it h me. It appears that in 1915 these facts were brought under the notice of the Taxation Department and the Attorney-General's Department, and that in the same year the Income Tax Assessment Act was amended in order to take away from the Commissioner of Taxation his power to 1 levy a tax of 5 per cent, on the turnover of any company in regard to whose returns he did not feel satisfied. This amendment deprived the Commissioner of the power to> impose taxation upon a company which it was clearly apparent to ordinary business circles was earning huge profits, but being a subsidiary company to the various other corporations was enabled to transfer the whole of its profits to a foreign corporation and so avoid the payment of any taxation here. case shows grave laxity either on the part of the Commissioner of Taxationi n not bringing his knowledge before the Government or on the part of the Government, presuming they were possessed of the Commissioner's knowledge, in allowing' a measure to remain on the statuteThat position book which enabled a company that had been successfully trading in Australia for many years to avoid all payment of taxation. I hope that the Treasurer wil l be able to tell the Committee what steps have been taken by the Government, first, in regard to the action instituted two and a half years agoi against the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company for the recovery of a very large sum .of money; and secondly, in regard to the advance of over £100,000 to Messrs. K i d man and Mayoh for the building of certain vessels, a matter into which the Public Works Committee inquired on behalf of the Government in December last. Both matters affect the finances to a considerable extent, and there should have been some finality in regard to them. been, but we cannot get finality, because both matters are in the Law Courts. plains othat certain of the criticisms of the Leader of the Country party upon the manner in which the Budget had been prepared were somewhat caustic, but I thinki t can be proved that the right honourable gentleman's complaint is not justified. We. are told that the gross public debt of the Commonwealth at 30th June, 1921, was £401,720,025, but that by deducting £69,710,993 for certain purposes the net Commonwealth debt at the same date was £332,009,032. The Treasurer is taking credit for loans to the extent of £16,750,000 raised by the Commonwealth in London for States public works, and for loans to the extent of £27,927,464 for soldier land settlement, wheat silos, &c.

That traffic is a very big item in South Australian railway finance. that during the last five years the deficit has amounted to the sum I have stated. In Queensland the deficit in 1918-19 was £1,418,000; in 1919-20, £1,229,000; and in 1920-21, £1,739,000. In 1914 the tonnage was 4,301,000 tons, and in 1920-21 3,867,000 tons, the reduction again being very considerable. In ""Western Australia in 1916-17 the deficit on working was £214,000; in 1917-18, £289,000; in 191819, £359,000; in 1919-20, £399,000; and last year, £418,000. The tonnage in that State shows an increase from 2,750,000 tons in 1919-20, to 3,000,000 tons' last year. In (New South ""Wales the deficit the honourable in 1918-19 was £193,000, and last year £137,000; but in that State also the tonnage shows a slight increase. Mr Fraser, the Ohief iCommissioner, only about a"" year ago pointed out that, although there had been a considerable increase in the mileage in the New South Wales railway system, there had not been anything like a corresponding increase in the tonnage hauled. In Victoria in 1919 there was a loss of £163,000*, in addition to a payment of £91,000 for non-paying lines, and in 1920 a loss of £212,000, although there was a fairly substantial increase in the tonnage as compared with the previous year. A careful examination ;of the population statistics discloses the dangerous position into which we are drifting. We must do something to encourage production, particularly when we find that in a prosperous State such as Victoria the population in the metropolitan area has increased by 40 per cent., whilst that in the rural areas has increased by only 3 per cent. Figures 'such as those are very disquieting, and prove that the policies of the various Governments need amending in order that development in rural districts may be facilitated. honourable member will find that it is the same everywhere. to realize the danger. it is very serious; our only comfort is The Broken ,Hill mines were that other countries are quite as badly off as we are. worse off financially, but that is no reason why the drift should continue.

We have enormous areas awaiting development in Western Australia, and I want the Government to advance some definite policy other than voting money for the purpose of getting into touch with the Imperial authorities in regard to their project to assist reservists and others to settle in the Dominions. I understand the Imperial Government are quite prepared to give financial assistance to men desirous of coming to Australia. In the south-western and western portions of Western Australia there is an enormous belt of wheat-growing land, and about 500,000 farmers could easily be settled on it . In the north-west, in the Kimberley District, there is also wonderful country, but assistance in development is required, and the settlers must be assured that no matter where they go facilities will be afforded them to get their products to the markets of the world. danger in having Bhe northern and north-western parts of Australia unpopulated and undeveloped. quite possible that many British people could be induced to help in the settlement of those vast areas. am. very sanguine that petroleum oil will be discovered in the northern part of Australia, because it is in a line with cept his assurances.

There is no man who has fought harder than the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to build up secondary industries, and he knows perfectly well that what is needed for the successful development of those industries is the nearest possible market for the producer. It is only by increased production that the desired result can be obtained. Nobody can examine the Estimates without realizing that the Government have been careless; that the cost of administration is far above what it should be,, and that the Ministers have done little,, indeed, in the direction of giving generous assistance to the primary industries. I wish the Government would agree to take back the Estimates. If the vote upon the amendment is defeated, I assure honourable members that there will be no possibility of making any substantial alterations in the Estimates. that, whether the amendment be agreed to or not, it will still be the duty of the Treasurer to try to retrench. bility for the Estimates and for the financial policy of the Government were entirely that of the Treasurer, I would accept the assurances of the right honourable gentleman. But there must be considered the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) and There is grave his .dominating methods, his control of the Cabinet, and the irresponsible-manner in which he has spent public moneys It is without consulting Parliament; in view of all of which honourable members will not be justified in accepting the stateI ment of the Treasurer. If the latter Minister were free, if he had control, and could use his own judgment, I would acare not even sure that the Treasurer will remain lone at his post. Practically all honourable members are under the strong impression 'that he will be appointed to the High Commissionership; and then there will be another Treasurer. I trust that honourable members will realize the importance of the amendment of the Leader of the Country party, and will recognise how difficult it would be to secure economy in respect of any of the various items contained in the Estimates, if that amendment were rejected. They should give full heed to the demands of the people for economy in administration. If they do so, I am sure they will vote for the amendment.

140,Mr Maxwell (Fawkner) [4.23],"Leader of the Country party would foe false to the pledges which he had made to his constituents. bourne daily papers very recently the attention of honourable members was drawn to the fact that their constituents would very narrowly scan the division lists when the amendment was put to the vote of this House. I shall vote against the amendment. I shall do so deliberately and after very careful consideration of the position. I deny that I am under any compulsion. I am not under the thumb of the Government. I exercise my own judgment in a matter of this kind; I have complete freedom of action. The position, as it presents itself to my mind, is this: So far as the Estimates are concerned, the Treasurer, who is a man of great experience, who has an intimate knowledge of the working of Public Departments, and who has, I believe, a sincere desire to finance the Commonwealth in its best interests, has come to this House and said', in effect, "" I have done my very utmost in the way of cutting down, consistent with the interests of the community, and I can do no more."" Sir member might add, "" within the limits of the settled policy of Parliament."" how has that statement beeu met? It has been met by the amendment of the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), which, on the face of it, appears to be a very harmless proposition, but which, in its intention, is an absolutely deadly thing. I do not think any utmost, and that neither he nor the Goone can believe for a moment that the honvernment can do more in the direction orable member ever intended his amendment as aught else than a vote of censure upon the Government. I have had the speech of the Leader of the Country party read to me. I have gone through it most carefully, and I have attempted to make an abstract of it. The honourable member emphasized the fact that Australia's debt is enormous; that it is, indeed, a staggerto turn the Government, out, and then I ing burden. He pointed out that there exists the greatest possible need for retrenchment in order that Australia's obligations may be met. Then the honourable member for Cowper proceeded to make most damaging charges, both against the Treasurer and the Government. He stated that in the compilation of his Budget the Treasurer was deliberately throwing dust in the eyes of the In one of the Melpeople; that the Treasurer was deliberately juggling with figures, and, in such a way as to deceive the people, to make it impossible for them to detect the true state of affairs. Then, having made specific charges in which was really involved the honour of the Treasurer, the Leader of the Country party wound up by bringing the whole of the Government into the same condemnation. He asserted that the Government were allowing the Commonwealth to drift into financial ruin, through ignorance and incompetence. And yet the honourable member said, "" I do not intend my amendment to be regarded as a vote of censure."" If one-tenth of what he said about the Government is true, they ought not to remain for another minute on the Treasury bench; and the honourable member for Cowper knows it. I carefully probed his speech to ascertain whether there was any practical suggestion for a solution qf our financial difficulties. But, so far as that question is concerned, one is told that it is no business of the critics of the Government to point out ways in which business of those critics? If the amendment were to be taken as its mover would Now, have it understood that he desires-if it were to be treated in a non-party spirit; if honourable members were to accept the advice that they should meet in a non-party spirit and discuss the situationthen, when that honourable member is told by the Treasurer that he has done his of retrenchment, it would become his bounden duty, as a critic of the Government, to point to directions in which retrenchment may be effected. It is only on the understanding that his amendment is intended as a vote of want of confidence that he could say, "" I am challenging the Government. I am going will show you a belter way."" The honourable gentleman, in dealing with these various difficulties, reminds one of the old Scotch minister's method of dealing with a knotty problem which he encountered in the course of an address to hispeople. It was a problem that he could not tackle, and he said, "" My friends,",43,Smith D O You Say T H At Creation Of Big Markets The More

That is my reading of the situation as far as the honourable for Cowper i9 concerned. speech with the subject cf the alleged overmanning ments. are overmanned, that our officers are overpaid, and that large economies can be effected Of course, the emoluments-.

I am as keenly anxious as any other honourable member in this Committee to effect every economy that can be* effected.

A suggestion was made in a, household that they should have a self-denial week, the object being to raise money towards a cause in which all members of the household morning they had a family conclave, at which the matter was discussed. member of the family said what he would do without. the request for self-denial went round the family circle. One said he would do without tea, another without sugar, a third without milk, and so on. At last they came to the young hopeful of the family, a little school chap. "" Well, Jack, what d6 you propose to do without?"" mind, dad, I will do without soap."" was his way of economizing. Mr Maxwell. fair in the to me that there are many people who are That is a splendid willing to do without soap, but they w ill not agree to deny themselves anything. That is where the shoe pinches. I do not care "" t u p p e n c e "" for the professions of economy of a man whose economy involves He has no self-denial. The sooner we as a people recognise that fact the better. The sooner we recognise that real economy outlines, and then he has will involve self-sacrifice on the part of every one, the better.

A great deal of the that argument that we have listened to in this chamber, and that we have read outside in the columns of the newspapers, I profess my utter inability to follow. Possibly that is due to my density, or possibly to my inexperience; but, honestly, I do not on the other side understand it . Here is one specific piece of expenditure that I can understand. In this connection a friend of mine It was deliberately incurred by this House, and the House that incurred it can delete it .

The item is in the Estimates for any member to deal with . members are prepared to do when we come to that particular item. The honourable member for Cowper has drawn a most appalling picture of the condition of Australia.

"" When you have no case, abuse the other side."" Canberra is another definite item in regard to which the House has it within its power to lighten the burden of the people of Australia. An expenditure has been suggested this year of nearly £500,000, but the Treasurer has resisted that £200,000. All honour to him. I have no doubt that he has put down that amount in spite of the pressure that has been brought to bear upon him by some of those members who are loudest in their demands for economy. If I had my way not one single penny would be spent on Canberra at present that could be avoided, and we should only spend what is absolutely necessary to prevent the deterioration of work' already done. I would pursue that policy until we are in a better financial position. Those are two -points-honorabl e members' emoluments and the -proposed expenditure on Canberra. One of the remarks of the honourable member for Cowper is that the Defence proposals of the Treasurer are an extravagance. amount that it is proposed to spend on the Permanent Fbroes and in doing that t he was following the Acting Leader of the Labour party, the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton), who moved an amendment to secure the reduction of the I hope I shall. £3,000,000 .

It s defeat rested w it h the Committee. Honourable members who, like the honourable member, believe that the Defence expenditure should be reduced should have supported me. show how f a r I can go with the honourable member. Werei t in my power, I would Y o u wil l not be able to at once destroy every armament and all munitions of war in the world. I shall T h a t interjection point out how that could be done. There are two ways of stopping war. One is by stopping the supplies that are the This proposed expenditure on sinews of war. Yet, although to-day the world is groaning under its burden of warlike expenditure, and its heart is almost broken by the disastrous experiences of the past six or seven years, in Great Britain £200,000,000 is being voted this year for warlike preparations; in demand, and has put down Prance, a similar amount; in the United States of America, £300,000,000; in Japan, £150,000,000; and here in Australia, £7,000,000 . W it h out the co-operativeassociation of labour, money is absolutely useless. We are constantly hearing from Opposition members that wars are caused by capitalists, by a knot of financiers, who, working in co-operation in different countries, foment international troubles in order that war may be brought about, so that, by their hellish alchemy,' they may extract from the blood and tears of the people the gold with which they enrich themselves. Here are the financiers and capitalists, according to Labour members, providing hundreds of millions of pounds for the purposes of war. Our honourable friends opposite suggest that this He spofie of the immense money is stolen from the pockets of the working classes, who alone supply the funds for prosecuting wars. But without the co-operative association of Labour, all this money is absolutely useless. We hear constantly of the solidarity of Labour; that Labour's cause is one Defence Estimates by nearly throughout the w o r l d; that there is a",45,Joseph Cook Th E Honourable Money Could Be Saved But Is It Not The

If Labour is solid, if its solidarity is anything more than the dream of a devout imagination, let it in the different countries influence those of its people who are engaged on armaments and munition making, so that they shall throw down their tools and refuse to do another stroke of work on things which have for their ultimate use the destruction of human life. Such a step would render impossible the building of another warship, the casting of another gun, the manufacture of another rifle, the making of another cartridge.

I do not see that a change of The inconsistency Governmenb would be for the benefit of the country. I feel that what we want, and certainly what I should like to see, in Australia, is a Government which would formulate an unpopular programmea Government that would sit down and consider what was in the best interests of Australia, rather than what would be most likely to secure votes in an election campaign. The curse of this country and what has led ua into the financial impasse in which we find ourselves to-day is the fact that we have had' Governments and parties going to the country, and trying to outbid each other I wish to go for popular support. The National party is not free from blame in this regard. We made a big bid for popularity and for votes, and we got them. The party I would like to say on the other side made a bigger bid for popularity. They made promises the fulfilment of which would involve the' Commonwealth, according to the estimates of the right honourable in an additional expenditure of something like £16,000,000. The people of the Commonwealth, to their credit be What is it that prevents their it said, did not accept the offers of the party,, opposite. There, I say, is the curse of Australia.

WhilstI have the greatest possible respeot and esteem for every member, individually, of that party, for the party itself I have no such esteem. I say that the Country party has not justified its existence since it came into this House. I was astounded ta hear from the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) the remark that too often party interests are allowed to operate to the detriment of the larger interests of the community. Fancy that coming from a member of a party .every member of which must be a member of the Farmers Union, one plank of whose constitution is that where there is a conflict of interests between the primary producing interest and any other, the primary producing interest must prevail. plank. fully through the constitution of the Farmers Union. I have often wondered how it ia that I find the' honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) in the ranks of the Country party. I understand it now. The honourable member does not know the constitution of the party. that when my honourable friend, with that courage and integrity for which he is so noted, does discover"" where he is, and finds his position untenable, he will get out of it in the speediest way possible. member not think that the primary industries should come them in. order of precedence. I say that our duty as Nationalists is to adjust interests where they seem to conflict. It is our duty, as between apparently conflicting interests, to do the fair thing. I have said that the curse of the Commonwealth, so far, has been the competition of two political parties, each trying to outbid tlie other, and the confusion has been rendered worse confounded in this House by the introduction of a third party, which aspires to hold the balance of power. I believe that the people generally recognise that, and I have no doubt that in due time my honourable friends of the Country party will discover what the real opinion of the country is with regard to tjieir party and its functions. I do not wish to further delay the Committee. I feel that in voting against the amendment I shall be doing no violence to the pledge given to my constituents when I said that I would support, in its main lines, the policy of the Nationalist party and the Nationalist Government so long as their actions commended themselves to my judgment. Although a member of the Nationalist party, I am not bound hand and foot to the Government, who happen to be the executive of the party at the present time. If I thought that they were as incompetent, as cowardly, and as unprincipled as the mover of the amendment would have us believe, I would vote for the amendment at once. But because I believe that, whatever their shortcomings may be, they have honestly endeavoured to do their best for the Commonwealth in regard to the adjustment of the finances, I intend to vote against the amendment. [5.3] I am siire that we are all gratified to see my esteemed, friend the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) in I have not the slightest doubt his place, and to liave heard him deliver the vigorous speech he has just made. I , like the honourable member, am a supporter of the Government; but, when I say that, I say also that I owe them no slavish allegiance, and I claim absolute and complete independence, so far as criticism and act-ion a e concerned. Myv first? ° honourable friends opposite, and honourable members on my right belonging to tbe Country party, may be quite sure that a number of us who'sit behind the Government are not going to be fascinated by alluring and perhaps popular amendments which may seem prospectively in their eyes to be remarkably hopeful. I have no personal or selfish motives to serve, and I can, I think, speak with complete impartiality in the matter. In my judgment, we should not be justified in dislodging the Government just now. At the same time, I believe that we are called upon to aid the Government so far as we can in giving effect to the volume .of opinion throughout Australia which demands a guarantee that public ad-, ministration will be carried on with the most rigid economy, having regard to the financial stress and strain how obtaining,",48,Joseph Cook Ever Y Member Of Be Applied To Our Defence Expenditure

I admit that the right honourable the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) is entitled to a considerable amount of sympathy and also to generous criticism. I do not, however, propose to refrain from candid criticism where I consider it my duty to criticise. When I say that the Treasurer is entitled to generous consideration, I do uot discount the grave difficulties he has had to overcome, and the complicated under which he has introduced his Budget. I believe there has been, on his part, a genuine anxiety to give the fullest expression to the desire of the community for economy. I believe he has made a genuine effort in that regard, and I go further, and say that the Budget he has presented is an honest Budget. A t the name time, if my right honourable friend is obsessed, as he evidently is, w i th the idea that it is a perfect Budget, he is completely mistaken. I think that the character of the criticism in this House, combined with that which has taken place outside, should at least indicate to the Treasurer that all are not agreed as to the perfection of the Budget. While I realize that he has supplied what is metaphorically referred to as the "" pruning knife "" with some delicate touches, I feel that what is really required at the present time, to use the less picturesque expression of the right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) , is the ""meataxe.""

My reply is that it has not reported on the BudgetI t should be asked to report on the Budget, and to state whether or not it represents the greatest measure of economy that could properly be effected. This House has not the knowledge to economize w it h the degree of guarantee the public are entitled to that the economies undertaken ""are justified and are properly effected. have spent the money before the report was due. so. I do not suppose that all honourable members accept the same view that I do in this regard; but I wish to give the Treasurer the fullest credit for what he has done. As he has told us, he has kept his hand and eye closely on the expenditure, and has reduced it by something like £11,500,000. Of coursej that saving conies in. a natural way so far as a considerable proportion is concerned, but I must also say that the Treasurer has, in many respects, paid out of revenue which I commend most heartily-con siderable sums of money which he could legitimately have paid out of loans. of such charges in this Budget which ought, strictly speaking,' to go to loaij. The Treasurer has told us that the actual expenditure out of revenue last year was £64,624,000, and that he contemplates spending about £4,250,000 less this year than the actual expenditure of last year. 'So far as I have been able to investigate, a very considerable proportion of that £4,250,000 items. In tlie case of war pensions there is a reduction of some £700,000 , in repatriation work a reduction of something like £1,500,000, and in various other war services a reduction of some £700,000> at least, upwards of £3,000,000 of a non-recurring character. I note, moreover, a saving of some £900,000 on public works. The fact remains, however, that the Treasurer has reduced the estimated It s recommendations provided expenditure for the coming year considerably below the actual expenditure of last year. There is one very significant matter to which the Treasurer has referred. The contemplated revenue for this year is something like £61,500,000, and the Treasurer very properly points out that he contemplates spending £20,000 less than that amount. He said in his Budget statementI have managed to bring the estimate of expenditure out of revenue to a figure slightly below the actual expenditure of last year. This has been effected despite having to find additional amounts as under. These sums amount to upwards of £4,000,000. I ask honourable members to see whether there is not room here: for The Government would considerable reduction. Amongst the additional'amounts which the Treasurer has to find is nearly £800,000 for military I do not think defence, £172,000 for naval new works, and £360,000 for air services. The Treasurer then refers to additional expenditure on invalid and old-age pensions, the basic wage, post-office maintenance, and so forth. The point I am making is that the r i g ht honourable gentleman takes credit for having reduced the estimated expenditure for the coming year by £20,000 below the actual expenditure of last year, notwithstanding the fact thab he has to find upwards of £4,000,000 for additional expenditure on tbe services I have mentioned. m ""an bar let me say that, although that is so, the Estimates voted last year for defence were not spent, and we are voting no more this year for defence than last I admit that. year, but £25,00 0 less. last year is beside the question aud does not interest me.

That right honourable gentleman and the Minister for Defence will have to satisfy the House in regard to this expenditure before we are justified in assenting to it. I have said from the beginning that this House is incompetent to deal with these matters. The Government must have advice and information placed at their disposal to enable them to judge and take the responsibility. fence items and see which of them are essential and which are not. of the Treasurer and of the Prime Minister that there shall be further investigation, and further reduction, is the justipects of the income tax or the Customs fication I have for the attitude I am taking. spending this money-if you had said so last year, you would have been wrong. is the carry-over; but the point is that the Treasurer was able to save something like £4,000,000 on the Estimates of last year, and I am hopeful that he is going to save £2,000,000, or perhaps at least £1,500,000, this year. I think the Treasurer should endeavour to guarantee that there will be at least a saving of £1,500,000 in the coming year. can accomplish that saving by keeping a careful hand on tbe Treasury. circitnjstances. I have here a most appalling set of figures, which sets out that the Defence expenditure of the United States of America in 1920 was £696,000,000, while in 1914 it was £48,000,000. Minister is not comparing like with like. Our insignificant affairs, I think, can hardly be compared in magnitude with the responsibilities cast on the United States of America and the Mother Country. issues an invitation to disarmament is spending on arms I do not know how much more, but about fifteen times aa much as in 1914. ing with the question of disarmament at present, but anything we can do for the consummation of such a glorious objective we are anxious to do.

Beyond a few passing remarks, I shall not deal further with the prosv revenue, which have already been fully covered by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt). No doubt, in regard to the income tax, the Treasurer is acting on the best advice. I am mixed up with the business community every hour of the day, and so far as I have had an opportunity of judging, I do not for one moment think that the anticipation of anything like £15,000,000 from the income tax is justified for tlie coming year, nor do I think, having regard to falling prices, that the Customs Estimates will be* sustained. I sincerely He and earnestly hope that both Estimates may be realized, but I must say that the income tax in itself is of the most crushing character, and the people have a right to expect some relief in this regard. In 1918-19 we imposed a super-tax of something like 30 per cent., which produced £2,700,000; and, not satisfied with that, we imposed a further super-tax of 5 per cent., which produced something like £700,000. I say that the public are greatly disappointed that the Treasurer is not able to recommend at least some remission of this taxation, which is such that at the present time it is causing unemployment-is preventing and stifling the proper expansion of industry.

He has quoted many precedents for the utilization of an accumulated surplus for the requirements of the current year, bub the principle is bad. As a rule, these surpluses have been paid into some particular trust account. These are not normal times-the y are abnormal; and when the Treasurer had an accumulated surplus of £6,000,000 he should have applied it in reduction of our loan requirements, and asked the public for only £4,000,000 instead of £10,000,000. If the Treasurer had only realized the grave in j u r y done to Australian' industry by the withdrawal of £10,000,000 from ordinary circulation, he would have stretched a point to ask the public for only £4,000,000, using the accumulated .surplus of £6,000,000 to make up the £10,000,000 which he required. I understand that we are to have from the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) a statement regarding shipping and shipbuilding. I do not hesitate to say that I'have totally differed from the policy of the Government in regard to both the ownership of a shipping line and shipbuilding. I have previously voiced my protest in"" the House, but, whilst I was prepared to concede a great deal under war conditions, I hope the Government will now see their way clear to get r i d of the Commonwealth steamers as quickly as possible, and also discontinue shipbuilding, and allow private enterprise to take the' place of the present ineffective Government effort. if private enterprise would. bhat the Commonwealth's gross expenditure on shipping, including its present obligations, amounts to about £6,000,000. There is on the present Estimates an item of £3,000,000, nearly the whole of which Ss required to meet obligations which have already been entered into. surprised to hear the Treasurer say that . no ships had been ordered since the armistice. If that be so, there may be some justification for the ordering of the ships now being constructed, although I still contend that the House should have been consulted. being constructed were ordered immediately after the armistice. Sir ROBERTBEST I was under the impression that that was so, and I say that that expenditure is totally unjustified. I previously complained bitterly that contracts had been undertaken without Parliament being consulted. If that action was taken after the armistice it was the more unwarranted. I read the other day that about seven or eight cargo ships which had ben purchased in February, 1920, for £1,460,000 were sold in August last for £266,000. Ships are available at the present time for about £ 7 10s. per ton, for which we have paid, or are paying £2S or £30 per ton. 1 passenger ships are costing £ 5 8 per ton. to cargo ships, which are purchasable at £ 7 10s. per ton. has the honourable member for that statement? quotation I read was from the London Times. items are reached I shall make to the Committee a clear and comprehensive statement setting out all the facts.

Primary, producers generally are in much the same position with regard to the. appalling depreciation in the price of stock and products, the Tariff has placed a further burden of £32,500.000 on the people of Australia, but principally on the producers, so it is easy to imagine what kind of a time is ahead of them. When I was in the Maranoa division of Queensland recently, taking part in the election campaign, the land-owners informed me that but for the excessive tax in the form of Customs duty on fencing wire, they would have been able to find employment for hundreds of the unemployed men who were drawing Government sustenance money in various parts of tlie Commonwealth. The duty on commodities essential to the welfare of our primary producers has placed an enormous burden upon them. Those honourable members who were responsible for the Tariff will be asked some very knotty questions when they go before the people at the next election. During the debate on the Tariff we had the spectacle in this House of manufacturers and artisans working together for a common purpose. My friend, the honourable for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins), Mr H. V. McKay, one of our principal iron manufacturers, were, for the time kins wanted high pay for iron workers, Mr Robert Cook. The following high profits for his company.

This, I think, 0 1 0 would be ample provision under efficient 0 0 11 0 0 2£ administration. I have not made an advertising medium of myself by moving the adjournment of the House tb discuss pensions grievances. I have always gone straight to the responsible head of the Department, and I must confess that the Minister has met me very fairly. The Pensions Department is not managed as it should be managed. I know war pensioners in my electorate who are physical wrecks as the result of service their produce. Notwith standing abroad, who have had their pensions 'reduced to such an extent that it is impossible for them to meet their obligations; whilst there are others in fairly good health whose pensions have not been affected. I believe the same disadvantages apply in connection with old-age and invalid pensions, particularly the latter. The expenditure in connection with invalid pensions is necessary and ample if properly distributed; but there are some anomalies that must be adjusted, 1 and the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) would be rendering a service to the community if he arranged for a caref u l investigation to be made into the question of pensions generally. I do not wish to suggest that those who are justly entitled to pensions should have their payments reduced or stopped; but my complaint is that the £5,200,000 for old age and invalid pensions is not equitably distributed. I know that I am touching upon qiiite a number of unpopular topics, but I consider it my duty to ventilate these matters, although by so doing I may jeopardize my seat in Parliament. There member is also the question of maternity allowand ances, on which we are spending £700,000 a year, half of which is unwarranted because the money is not required by the recipients. If we had a Government with sufficient courage, payments in this direction could be reduced to £350,000 a year,",58,Joseph Cook Ever Y Member Of Be Applied To Our Defence Expenditure
266,"Being, Bosom Friends, Because Mr Wat",,59,Joseph Cook Ever Y Member Of Be Applied To Our Defence Expenditure
267,"And Mr Mckay, As A Director, Wanted","and in doing so we would not have to penalize those unfortunately circumstanced. The position could be met by refusing payments to persons receiving over a certain income, which would be perfectly fair. Why should the taxpayers be compelled to contribute towards the payment of £350,000 a year to people who do not require it? It is the duty of the Government, and of the members of the Committee, td realize the dangers confronting them, and to consider the position very seriously in the interests of the institution we are on the high road to Commonwealth. The duplication of services to be found in connection with the Taxation Departments also exists in relation to Commonwealth and State Savings Banks, and the unnecessary expenditure in this direction is as great a public scandal as the payment of maternity allowances which are not needed. In almost every country town one sees a Commonwealth Savings Bank and a State Savings Bank undertaking similar work for which the community has to pay. Tasmania has already agreed to the amalgamation. town. and a State Bank? The Government will have to curtail expenditure in this direceconomy for the purpose of helping hon-. tion, as it is useless to have similar inorable members to decide whether any stitutions performing the same work. If the Commonwealth Government will only give a lead in this direction the State Governments will not be able to accuse us of extravagance. It is time a definite pronouncement was made in connection with the question of trading with Germany, as owing to compulsory disarmament Germany is able to spend £300,000,000 a year on her industries. .In these circumstances she will not feel the indemnity to any great extent, and at the same time will be able to defeat us commercially. I , saw an appalling announcement in the newspapers a few days ago to the effect that a German tender of £28,000 was accepted for a .large machinery plant required in a every word. foreign country, for which a British firm tendered at £77,000. Germany is paying able member for Wakefield has; but do . her operatives 5d. per hour, while Great the Government know of the existence of Britain is paying 2s. per hour for similar services. Germany's success in trade and the reports? commerce is indirectly affecting the Commonwealth, and in view of the approachcost of country telephones. ing crisis it is imperative thab the Estimates be reduced in order to balance the ledger. I have been a contractor for many years, and when contracts were not available men had to be dismissed. I am also a director of publio companies, and when business is not prosperous I am reluctantly compelled to recommend a reduction in the staff. A similar policy should be adopted in connection with Government expenditure, because if we look upon the Public Service as a benevolent ruin. If we follow the advice tendered by the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page), and, taking item by item, ask the Treasurer to recommend the reduction of expenditure where it is considered necessary, in the aggregate, by at least, £1,500,000, it will not only satisfy me, but I am sure it will meet with the approval of a vast majority of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth.

His scheme was received with great disfavour by the House of Commons, and by the public at large, especially the proposed renewal and increase of the income tax. Though an adverse motion on this subject by Mr Hume was negatived, the feeling in the House against the increase of this tax was too strong to be disregarded. 28th February, the Chancellor of the Exchequer made a new financial statement, in which he announced that the Government, in deference to the wishes of the House and the country, would not press for an increase of the income tax. ber ought to know that that Government went out on the Crimean War. know; but, as a matter of fact, this incident occurred some years before the Crimean War. ber says that, he knows nothing about history, or else he has no memory.

340,Mr Foley,"Yes; and a prettyonly. If anything should occur in this Chamber with which I disagree my conscience is clear that I have not to ask any otiher person what I shall do in the matter. There are items in the Estimates which I intend to oppose, and I shall submit my reasons for my opposition to them at the proper time. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) submitted a definite amendment that was quite in order, and said that his purpose was to secure a reduction of expenditure on Defence. That was a genuine proposal. The honourable member knew what he wanted, and he went right after it. He gave every other member of the Committee an opportunity to record a straight-out vote. The Leader of the Cpuntry party (Dr. Earle Page) has submitted another amendment, and since he did so the members of his party have been apologizing. They have been telling us that their amendment is not loaded, and that they do not mean it to be regarded as a want of confidence motion. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said straight out that he did mean it by his amendment, and there was no doubt at all that he did. If the members of the Country party desire to-night or at any other time to submit a motion or amendment, they should take f u l l repsonsibility for their action. to do so. The honourable member need not make any mistake about that. says that the members of the Country party are quite prepared to do so. He quoted some beautiful poetry for us about some one who took a Budget back. The honourable member quoted Todd, but Todd did not know everything. There was a man named Jackson, who also knew something. In what year was the poetry quoted written? another verse added to that poetry. Another poet wrote something about a man taking a Budget backBut if they should not take it back > 'Twould cause a sad reflection; And, worse than all, twould mean the sack, A general election! Honourable members say they want to economize. The Leader of the Country party told us that we have political incompetents, treachery, wastefulness, extravagance, and departmental faking of figures. Country party. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition would not say so, because he knows different. If , as the Leader of the Country party alleges, the Government is guilty of. treachery, wastefulness, and extravagance, and on top of all these things is incompetent, then the honourable member and his followers, in urging that his amendment, providing for a reduction of the Estimates brought down by that Government, is not to be taken as a motion of want of confidence, are not doing their duty to the people they represent. If the Government is guilty of these political sins, it cannot be politically honest. It has been held in a Court of Law that a man cannot be politically dishonest without being personally or socially dishonest. That being so, I contend that the Country party should be prepared to take the full responsibility for their action. The honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell) has said that he is going to vote against the Government on the score of economy. If he thinks that the Govermnent is no longer worthy of support he is right in voting against it ; but while he claims that greater economy is necessary he at the same time demands increased war pensions. If the war pensions are to be increased, then the Estimates must be increased accordingly. Another honourable member who proposes to vote against the Government on the ground that greater economy is necessary, is appealing for something else which will involve increased expenditure. Every honourable member of the Country party who has spoken has said that he believes that the Post and Telegraph Department has been starved. Not one of them has said that it would cut down the Estimates of that Department. All are in favour of an increased vote for post and telegraph services. That being so, how could they expect the Government to bring down Estimates providing for an expenditure less than that which was incurred last year? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that he wanted to cut down the Defence Estimates. posite are in favour of cutting down the Defence Estimates, but at the same time",67,Joseph Cook Ever Y Member Of Be Applied To Our Defence Expenditure

348,Mr Foley,"Honorabl e members opthey would increase the expenditure of other Departments. Does any honourable member who proposes to vote for the amendment want a reduction of the Estimates for the Post and Telegraph Department, or a reduction of war pensions? Does any one of them desire that the invalid and old-age pensionsshall be reduced, or the maternity allowance cut out ? No. If we consider that a division or an item i u the Estimates^ of any Department is too high, we shall be able to move for its reduction. I , for' one, intend to exercise that right. If , however, honourable members say that the Estimates as a whole are wrong, then they condemn the Government for bringing them down. I take the view that a definite policy should be laid down in regard to the Post and Telegraph Department. The PostOffice is just as essential to the development of Australia as are our railways or any developmental work. Mr' PEOWSE ber does not believe in living beyond his means. many men in Australia who would allow n me to do so. should be told by the Parliament that his Department is not expected to pay-that it is to be regarded as a part of the developmental policy of the Commonwealth. If that policy were laid down good work would result. We could follow such a policy and still save money. There is much talk just now of a National Convention to consider the amendment of the Constitution. There could be no greater waste of money than wonld be involved in the holding of such a Convention. This Parliament has been in existence for nearly twenty-one years, and during that time no party has had a monopoly of it . Every party has occupied the Treasury bench, and surely there can be found in a National Parliament men of .sufficient brain's to be able to recommend to tlie people' desirable amendments of the Constitution. Their efforts might be supplemented by Committees appointed by the State Parliaments' to make recommendations. In that way, the faults which have been found in the working of thc Constitution could be so amended that the National Parliament would be more f u l l y equipped to properly carry on the affairs of the Commonwealth. There is no need for a Convention, and the holding of it would mean a serious waste of public funds. When the promised taxation measures are brought down, I shall have something to say w i th regard to the taxation proposals of the Government. The mining industry of Australia has undoubtedly been retarded of late years by Eederal taxation and other causes which are not hard to nnd. The whole industry, which means so much to Australia, and which has clone so much for the country, is relying wholly and solely on the gold premium which is being paid by non-British countries. If the gold bonus were stopped to-morrow, every mine in Australia with two exceptions would have to shut down. There is urgent need of taxation reforms. The honourable member for Dampier( Mr. Gregory) knows as well as I do of specific instances in which Federal taxation has severely handicapped the industry. I can But the honourable memsay, however, that there was no more pleased section of the community in Australia than were the people of the various I do not think there are mining constituencies when the Treasurer announced his intention of repealing certain iniquitous taxation measures, and so The Postmaster-General giving the industry the relief that it needs. I shall reserve any furthe r remarks I have to make on the subject of taxation u n t i l the measures relating to the Treasurer's proposals are before us. In conclusion, I repeat that if the amendment means anything at a l l , it means that this Government is incompetent. Neither the Leader of the Country party nor any of his followers will deny that they have contended that the Government is incompetent. tention. I said exactly the opposite. I urged, however, that we wanted a better Budget. The honourable members of the Country party, thinking the Government in competent the exception of the honourable member, has put forward that view. If that! is their honest belief, then they are destitute of every essential necessary to Australian statesmanship if they do not vote against the Government.

Earle Page) is placed on the Treasury bench. do not know tliat I have quite made up my mind which way I am going to vote. I cannot, however, let this occasion pass without saying something, and I hope to treat the question, asi far as possible, in a non-party way. Unlike the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Foley), I cannot see that the Budget and the finances of the country ought to be regarded as party matters. I listened to the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page), and I consider he made out a very good case. I am not satisfied w it h the way in which the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph. Cook) and the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) received the honourable member's remarks; but I cannot allow such matters to sway me-the y are only by the way. orable member W a t t ), your vote is r i g h t ! the division is taken. I cannot say that the Budget satisfies me, for I do not see in it any real promise of economy. I remember that during the elections the Prime Minister, at Bendigo, said that the Government would observe the strictest economy. I went before my electors on that plank, and I am doing my best to observe it . This Budget makes no provision for the future. Treasurer has raked it a b it , and cut down this or that vote, but there is no promise or principle laid down as to what is to be done in the f u t u r e to stop the financial d r if t . These are not ordinary times, and the Treasurer cannot take exception to my speaking in this way, seeing that I have done so on two or three previous occasions. I cannot help it if the Treasurer takes no notice-that is his own business. The financial situation is so serious that the Government ought to rise to the occasion, bub we find in the Budget no indication of any serious attempt-an y heroic attempt-to meet our present desperate case. I see nothing in the Budget about reducing the maternity allowance and paying it only to those women who need it , nothing about cutting down the expenditure on the Federal Capital and other expenditure that could, very well be put aside for the present, nothing about a scheme of national insurance and old-age pensions under which the people shall be made to contribute.

If the Government do not exercise rigid economy, how can they expect the general public to do so? Unless every individual does his part in the exercise of thrift, how is the country going to pull round? Australia must get down to hard work and develop her latent wealth; and to that end the Government must set the right example. members in the corner must know perfectly well that this amendment cannot be taken as any other than an expression of want of confidence. any price. point. If we could get real economy by voting against the Government, I should do so to-night; but I see no promise of anything but political chaos. We must consider all the facts, and we know that if this political chaos is created, it will be no time before there is a dissolution. Personally, if I were anxious about retaining my seat in this House, there could not be an appeal to the country at a more opportune time than the present. I do not think that the people outside desire a dissolution, but rather that the government of the country shall be carried on. Unless there be a double dissolution, another election for the Senate will not be due for twelve months, and if a single dissolution were to take place now it would mean that every three years there would be separate elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives, and that would mean an additional cost of £60,000 or so every three years. by a single dissolution we saved the country £2,000,000 or £3,000,000. we are to save the country £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 by adopting that course. The honorThe amendment proposes that the Estimates shall be cut down by £2,800,000, so that the Government may live within their income. They can do that by refraining from spending, but if a change of Government takes place I have no asfrom the incoming Cabinet than from the present Government, who have promised to give the closest supervision to the expenditure with a view to economy. I think the Treasurer should go further, and give the Committee an assurance that he will reduce expenditure without waiting for this Committee to indicate where the reductions shall be made. It is very 1 difficult for a private member to place his finger on an item of expenditure which he can definitely pronounce excessive. He may point out an item which, in his opinion, should be reduced, but a satisfactory explanation will be given by As I say, honourable the Department, and the item will pass. that to-day I have refused requests for expenditure totalling £50,000. that, because I am convinced that the Treasurer can save by refraining from spending. Since the amendment was moved we have heard the Treasurer promise that the strictest supervision of the 1 expenditure would be maintained in order to see that the outgoings did not exceed the income. I believe that will be done, and if it be done properly I am satisfied that we shall get as much economy in that way as we would by compelling a change of Government, especially as we cannot be sure of getting a new and stable Government. In the present state of parties I cannot see how any other Government could conduct the affairs of the country for a month without being forced to go before the electors. This should not. be, and would not have been so if there had been less party spirit behind the amendment and more thought for the interests of the country.

The amendment was moved in a party spirit. for the Leader of the party (Dr. Earle Page) to say that finance should be treated as a non-party matter, but the amendment is clearly a party move. Sir member for Echuca( Mr Hill) said that the gun was loaded and at full cock. terests of economy was necessary, why was not an open indication of it given, so that those who were in favour of the proposal could have consulted and put a proposition to the Government. If the Government had not accepted their proposal, it would have been easy to substihonorable gentleman knows. The State tute another Government that would give satisfaction to the House and the country. That course should have been followed, but it is too late now, for members have already pledged their votes. The amendment savours too much of party tactics. It is a well-known fact that throughout this Parliament many members on this side of the House have held exactly the same views on finance as are held by the Country party; in fact, every honourable member on this side was returned on an economy plank. The Governmenb have not displayed sufficient strength in this matter. If they cannot save sufficient money to enable the finances to balance, they should be prepared to retrench. They could have proposed a 20 per cent, reduction of all salaries over £500, per annum. That is quite an 'easy step to take, and if they cannot balance the ledger by any other means they should be prepared to do that. orable member advocate a 20 per cent, reduction of civil servants' salaries? a certain amount, starting with members of Parliament.

The Treasurer says that he is waiting for honTreasurer to take the initiative. orable members to indicate where these reductions can be made. I have no confidence in that sort of thing. I have seen too many Budgets presented and debated to believe that economy can come in that way.

There has been a little bargaining on the floor of the chamber during the day, and I ask the Treasurer to indicate what he thinks of my suggeswill exercise the strictest scrutiny over the expenditure, but I want a little more from him.

If the Treasurer does not care to give me an answer, I must conclude that he proposes to adopt the usual course and get the Estimates through in thin Committees. the Committee, as I have already stated, will be invited to give its best consideration to the whole of the Estimates, and I shall take good care to see that a f u l l and complete explanation"" is given on every vote. well, so far as it goes.
