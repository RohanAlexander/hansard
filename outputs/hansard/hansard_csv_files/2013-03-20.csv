As she scurries from the way with the environment minister's chamber, she might like to explain this proposal for an independent scientific advertisement from the Byron Shire Echo, committee to look at large-scale mining and issue 27.39, on 12 March 2013: 'Authorised coal seam gas projects and look at the issues. by J Elliot, Tweed Heads'.

The reason she is driving this is so I am on the record about my support for that the people of Richmond are not talking farmers and my support for the environment. about the national economy, about BER or I have said time and time again that the about pink batts in roofs: 'So let's distract farmers in my electorate will be feeding the them.

We'll scare the pants off the and the Ganges, and they have the methods, people of the North Coast and tell them that the technology and the skills to maintain and these evil gas companies are coming to get improve that soil. We do not want to them.' This is a scandal. We are supposed to introduce an industry that is going to destroy be in this place representing, supporting, that.

The fact that the NFF, who support and watches the debate. That is one thing I farmers at a peak level, have come out and give him great credit for. Where is he today? said that this bill is not adequate and does not Is he a tad embarrassed about the scant really change anything is a clear indication nature of this legislation? of what we are seeing here. The scientific I am not pro coal seam gas and I am not committee already has the ability to look at opposed to it. I support the people of New this. I am not saying that this bill is South Wales, the people of my electorate, necessarily going to harm our farmers or being protected. We saw that in a bipartisan people on the coast. It is just not going to help them. It is interesting that this taxpayerthat were under licence where it would be an paid advertisement in the Byron Shire Echo absolute crime to develop anything but is going into an area where there is no CSG agriculture, an area where the aquifers and industry at this moment. This is an appalling the coal seams were close together. But in situation. places like the Pilliga forest and areas around In the Parkes electorate, we have large Narrabri there are 700 or 800 metres of areas under exploration licence. It is a impervious rock between the water aquifer concern for the farmers that live in those that sustains those areas and the aquifer with areas. But I say to those farmers: putting coal seam gas in it. To not look at that and to your hands over your ears and shouting at not look at the possibilities of exploiting that whoever comes nearby and sending emails resource while protecting the farmland personally insulting your local member over would be, I believe, a nonsense. this will not solve the issue.

I said, 'That's great. wanted to go onto. The farmers came to see This will work.' me and started talking about it. And there Then, when we discovered, after some were local environmentalists and other locals time, that it was not natural gas, and we who were worried about it. started to ask questions about it-'Okay, so Most of the people in local government in you're going to do coal seam gas mining; my area have come out saying that they do what is that?

So did local farmers. locals and I said, 'This has the potential to be Some farmers have said yes, but you have the rare earth.' In Lismore, many years ago very few rights, under the way the state they wanted to set up a rare-earth plant, and based scheme works, to say no. But some of thousands of people took to the street in the farmers did say yes, and now some of Lismore and marched against it. There were them are worried because they are looking at thousands of local people who said, 'No.' some of the science that is in on coal seam Back in 2010-11 I saw that coal seam gas gas mining and unconventional gas mining. had the potential to be a 'rare-earth' issue. I first became alert to it when I read the I met with the gas companies-I met with National Water Commissio's position them here-and talked with them. You have statement on coal seam gas mining, which heard a lot about social licence. That is they put out in 2010. It was updated in 2012, something I spoke about to the gas when they said that basically what they said companies. I said, 'You have to earn that. in 2010 stands.

But you also have to live in applying the precautionary principle-which a community, be in a community and be we should to our water and to prime welcome in that community.' It is clear in my agricultural land-you would not do it. community that those companies are just not I then read the CSIRO publication on welcome. It has been a very fraught issue for water, and it addressed different sectors and a lot of people. All sorts of people have been areas right across Australia. There is a involved. section in there-to memory it is chapter The honourable member for Parkes was 10-that deals with coal seam gas mining talking about farmers and saying that they and large coal mining. Again, it states quite would be the ones who would feed the clearly that they do not know some of the world. From the evidence-the science and impacts on water and the aquifers, and that the literature-that I have looked at to date I there are other issues. So why would we do it think that farmers will not be able to. If coal if there are groups like those saying that? seam gas mining goes ahead on their land NowI will move to the next part of the they will not be feeding anyone; they will story. A lot of locals in my area were starting not even be feeding their families, let alone I would like to say a few other things feeding the world. That is just nonsense. about what has happened at state level. I The honourable member for Parkes also have said in media interviews on the radiotalked about the National Farmers' I have been saying it since 2010; I have been Federation. In essence, he was saying that talking about coal seam gas since then and they were against the bill.

It is a consequence of the health. People are concerned about the burgeoning LNG export industry. There are impacts on their health. But I come back to many documents on this. It is to do with the water. One of the things that worries people on-selling of the gas for export. A lot of it is that a huge amount of water is extracted in will be sold and it goes up in price. That is the process. If you read the extra work that reflected back to us domestically and we end the National Water Commission did beyond up with a higher price.

Wednesday, 20 March 2013 Stirling Electorate: Surf Lifesaving lifesaving clubs play all around Australia in ensuring that when we go to the beach we have the best possible protection. In my electorate of Stirling, we have some of the best beaches in Australia, in fact probably the best beaches in Australia, and they make up just a small part of the large Western Australian coast. I am fortunate enough to represent two surf lifesaving clubs in Stirling, the Scarboro Surf Lifesaving Club and the Trigg Island Surf Lifesaving Club. I would like to congratulate Trigg Island Surf Lifesaving Club for finishing third overall in the SunSmart Junior Surf Lifesaving Championships and also congratulate Scarboro Surf Lifesaving Club on finishing eighth overall. It was a great achievement for both clubs and it is great to see the level of participation by all the kids. I look forward to attending the SunSmart Senior Surf Lifesaving Championships this Sunday, 24 March, hosted locally by Trigg Island Surf Club. Over 800 of WA's best surf lifesaving athletes will converge on Trigg Beach for the annual two-day event, which is a crucial lead-up event to the Australian championships next month. Trigg Island Surf Club are expected to battle it out for the champion club crown, as they are currently second only to Sorrento Surf Lifesaving Club in the electorate of my diabolical opponent the member for Moore. I wish all competitors from both Scarboro Surf Lifesaving Club and Trigg Island Surf Lifesaving Club the best of luck in this weekend's carnival. I imagine that the Scarboro Surf Lifesaving Club will also be very pleased with the state Liberal government's $30 million announcement to develop the Scarborough beachfront. The plan includes new pedestrian promenades and cycling paths, fitness equipment, barbeques, children's playground, seating and shade along the beach, public art and improved parking facilities. In conjunction with this there are plans to increase children's activities as well as outdoor movie screenings, bike hire and pop-up kiosks, all of which will create more local jobs within the Stirling community. In the past I have contacted the Hon. Simon Crean in an effort to secure federal government funding for this development. Unfortunately, just as it was neglected by the previous Labor state government, the federal government has been unwilling to help fund this key project for Western Australia. The proposed Scarborough Beach development plays an important part in reviving the tourism industry in Stirling and ensuring that more local jobs are created. I congratulate the state Liberal government for agreeing to fund this exciting development. I also congratulate the State member for Scarborough, Lisa Harvey, who put in lot of time lobbying for it. I am sure that many local Stirling residents will be happy to see Scarborough returned to a vibrant beachfront that is both safe and inviting for families and visitors. For many years it has been well known in Western Australia that Scarborough Beach has not lived up to its potential. It is a very significant injection of capital funding by the state government and I congratulate them for making what is a very sterling decision.",182,Notices Was Referred To The Parliamentary Standing

I have recently had the opportunity to join with Adelaide Lord Mayor Stephen Yarwood in opening the Adelaide City Digital Hub and Digital Enterprise programs. This is a fantastic resource for our community and I am incredibly proud that our government was able to fund it. It allows a place where there is free advice and assistance to local residents and businesses in Adelaide on how to harness the opportunities of super-fast broadband. Right across South Australia, as we speak, construction work is underway so that residents in Prospect can be connected to the NBN later this year. I am delighted that on FridayI will have the opportunity to join with the Prospect Council, who have worked so incredibly hard to ensure that our community will have access to this technology. We will be opening the Prospect Digital Hub and Digital Enterprise programs. In both of these hubs we will see that there is free support for small to medium businesses so that they can improve the way they do business, improve their online services and find opportunities to grow and expand. As local businesses understand the power of this technology and find smarter ways of operating for the future, I know this will result in a huge boost to our local economy and will support local job growth into the future. But business is not the only one to benefit from these digital hubs. We know that local families, community groups and schools can be assisted by a comprehensive and up-to-date digital literacy training program, run at the hub, which will help them participate confidently and safely online, help to educate our kids and find new ways of connecting with our community. I know that Adelaide City have a particular emphasis on outreach to seniors and making sure that we go through programs so that seniors can capitalise on the opportunities which are presented by this technology. Indeed, I know that in Prospect there is a real focus on art and how we can use the NBN to further enrich our creativity. I congratulate Lord Mayor Stephen Yarwood and Prospect Mayor David O'Loughlin, as well as the Adelaide City Council and the Prospect City Council, on delivering these innovative projects. It has been an absolute pleasure to partner with them for the benefit of a local community as we ensure that we have a plan for modern Australia. Forde Electorate: Elective Surgery of constituents in my electorate as a result of this government pulling $103 million of funding from Queensland Health and the flow-on effects of that. Not only has my office been contacted in regard to this issue but it has been raised in the local media. As with the feedback to my local office, the article in the local media the other day stated that elective surgery patients across Logan can expect now a wait of at least nine months, or even more, to be added to their waiting time for treatment. The local hospital has postponed almost half of its non-urgent elective surgeries until the new financial year starts in July. According to Metro South Health chief executive Dr Richard Ashby, non-urgent elective surgery has been reduced from 67 to 40 operating theatre sessions per week. Some 92 patients have been",184,Constituency Statements
175,Mr Van Manen (Forde) (09:36,"I rise to speak on an issue starting to affect a numbercontacted to reschedule surgery due before June 30 and others on the waiting list will now also be waiting for an unspecified length of time. I am concerned for patients on non-urgent surgery waiting lists who are suffering conditions which might be causing pain, discomfort and disability. A constituent recently contacted me to say that he has been affected by these delays. He was given only one week's notice that his hip replacement surgery was to be cancelled. He had already hired equipment for his home recovery and has now been told the surgery will not happen until at least the new financial year. This increase in postponements and the blow-out in waiting lists coincides directly with the Labor government taking $103 million out of the Queensland Health budget, of which $19 million came out of the budget of Metro South Health. When we look at the list of failures by this federal Labor government we see a total of $1.6 billion ripped out of public hospitals, $4 billion slashed out of private health insurance, $1 billion hacked out of dental health, and any number of other issues. This is not only affecting people in my electorate but electorates right around the country. All the while, as this finger pointing and blame game continues, it negatively affects all in our communities and these people are having to deal with those effects. It is not only the people who are not receiving the treatment, it is also family members, friends and employers. I request that the government reinstate the funding immediately. Griffith Electorate: Aboriginal Centre for Performing Arts Australia's most iconic arts and cultural institutions. OneI am particularly proud of is the Aboriginal Centre for Performing Arts at Kangaroo Point. Mr Deputy Speaker, knowing your interest in such matters, I welcome you to visit as a fellow Queenslander. The Aboriginal Centre for Performing Arts has a vision of becoming the Indigenous NIDA. This incredible arts and cultural training centre was established in 1997 by the Queensland government and is now the largest centre for training of Indigenous artists in Australia. The centre has grown from 56 students in 2008 to 88 students in 2011, an increase of 56 per cent. Last year, 90 young Indigenous artists were enrolled in their programs, and they are forecasting 130 students to be enrolled by 2016. This terrific organisation provides training and employment pathways through nationally accredited educational courses in the performing arts, including dance, music, acting and song. I recently visited the students, teachers and staff of the Aboriginal Centre for Performing Arts, ACPA, to see first-hand how these programs are making a difference in the lives of young Indigenous students. These eager young students have come from right across Queensland and New South Wales. Some have come off communities in the Cape, from regional towns interstate and from urban centres closer to Brisbane. A high proportion of students come from disadvantaged families. As part of their training, the centre provides specialised support programs that include accommodation, pastoral care, mentoring, numeracy and literacy programs and academic support. In addition, 20 per cent of their training each week is dedicated to the promotion and development of their traditional arts and cultural awareness under the guidance of community recognised and respected elders and cultural staff. This type of training and support is unique",185,Constituency Statements
176,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (09:39,"In my community in Brisbane's Southside, we have some ofto the Aboriginal Centre for Performing Arts. ACPA is a first-class Queensland and Australian institution. We are in fact creating something quite new here. I believe that part of the future of the Australian identity will increasingly be not just the great traditions we have inherited from our Anglo-Saxon past-the notion of the independence of laws, the Westminster system and parliamentary elections-but also at a much broader cultural level. I believe that there is a very creative fusion underway at a cultural level, led by our Indigenous brothers and sisters, who are becoming part and parcel of the new international cultural identity that we call Australia. Some of Australia's greatest artistic endeavours now form in the international art world the view of a modern, creative, Australian art movement-led by Indigenous Australians. Think of Emily's, for example. The students from ACPA have performed right across the country and overseas, including in New York. With incredible training and employment outcomes, and a dedicated bunch of teachers, staff and support groups, I commend this institution to the House's attention and to the government's future support. Bullpitt, Mr Noel, MBE pay tribute to a man who devoted a great part of his life to the surf lifesaving movement. Noel Frank Bullpitt MBE passed away recently in Bundaberg aged 100. He celebrated his 100th birthday in November last year at a function where his family and friends gathered to see him re-presented with the bronze medallion which he obtained originally on 1 October 1934, nearly 80 years ago. Noel was synonymous with the Bundaberg Surf Lifesaving Club as a member for 79 years and as president of the club for 41. He served as club captain and secretary and was awarded the Royal Lifesaving Citation of Merit in 1978 and the Surf Lifesaving Australia Outstanding Achievement Award in 1988. Along with Judge Adrian Curlewis, he was one of the very rare people who received a life governorship of Surf Lifesaving Australia. Noel was a member of the very famous march-past team which was inducted into Surf Lifesaving Australia's Hall of Fame in 2004. In 2007, the Year of the Lifesaver, Noel was awarded a medal of thanks and recognition for his many years of service to the club. Noel turned his thoughts on his beloved club, writing a tome The Surf Lifesaving Saga: The Bundaberg Surf Lifesaving Club, in which he detailed the club's history of the 65 years from 1921 to 1986. In public life Noel was secretary of the Fairymead Sugar Club, which later became Bundaberg Sugar, where he was also the secretary. He was an alderman of the Bundaberg City Council and a member of the port authority. He was an early mentor of mine in my political life and I feel a great debt of gratitude to him as a good friend and a person you could rely on for guidance. His was a life well-lived and his three sons and daughter have every reason to be proud of his contribution to sport, to his city and to his country. Melbourne Electorate: Racial Profiling Sometimes it is progressed by laws in this place, sometimes it is progressed by the decisions of government, but most of the time it comes from the courage of individuals or groups of individuals prepared to stand up to racism.

178,Mr Bandt (Melbourne) (09:45,"The struggle for full equality takes many forms.to fight racism, and today I want to pay tribute to the actions of some of my constituents in Melbourne who have successfully fought back against the racism they have experienced. Last month, Victoria Police settled a case brought by six young African men which alleged officers engaged in racial profiling. The six men, Daniel Haile-Michael, Jibril God, Shuab Ali, Maki Issa, Hakim Hassan and Magnus Kaba, pursued the case for six years before this settlement was reached just prior to a hearing before the Federal Court. These six young men, members of the African-Australian community, lived in North Melbourne and Flemington in my electorate at the time the alleged conduct took place from 2005 to 2009. The men claimed that they were often stopped and searched in the community solely on the basis of their ethnicity. Although the case was not determined by the court, a number of issues were raised which are now the focus of community concern. Among the evidence provided for the case is statistical analysis prepared by Professor Ian Gordon of the University of Melbourne. Professor Gordon's report identified that over the time period relevant to the case in these parts of my electorate, males of African ethnicity were 2.4 times more likely than men of other ethnicities to be subject to a stop and search. Professor Gordon also found this occurred despite the fact that the average number of offences committed by this group is significantly lower than that of males from other ethnic groups. That is a shocking statistic that needs to be addressed by Victoria Police. One of the outcomes of the settlement is an inquiry into the way checks on people are conducted by Victoria Police. This review will cover stop and search processes and will also review training. The Flemington and Kensington Community Legal Centre, a legal service in my electorate, was one of the organisations that acted on the complaint. The exposure the case has brought to public processes is a valuable contribution to the community and I commend the individuals who persisted with the case over so long. Anthony Kelly of the Flemington and Kensington Community Legal Centre has said that more accountable and transparent systems are still needed for stop and search procedures. In particular, this case has highlighted that the public should not have to resort to discovery processes to obtain statistics on stop and searches. As in the United Kingdom, this data should be routinely published so that it can be scrutinised by the public. This will ensure greater accountability and transparency. Mr Kelly suggests a system in which receipts are provided to individuals who are stopped and searched. The outcome from this case reflects years of work by the community sector and the perseverance of the men who took the case on, and I congratulate them on what they have achieved. It shows what can be done when people of courage take on institutionalised racism despite the odds. Macarthur Electorate: World Down Syndrome Day and I would like to take this opportunity to praise a group of parents in my electorate who are committed to supporting families touched by Down syndrome. The Right Start Foundation will celebrate World Down Syndrome Day with two events in Macarthur this week. There will be a special World Down Syndrome Day high tea this Thursday at Rydges in Campbelltown, and there will be a Family Fun Day this Saturday at the Camden Civic Centre from 1pm to 4pm with clown performers, face painting, balloons, food and drink.",187,Constituency Statements
179,Mr Matheson (Macarthur) (09:48,"This Thursday is World Down Syndrome DayEvery child born with Down syndrome deserves the best start to life and the Right Start Foundation is committed to making this a reality by providing support, awareness and services for these families. The Right Start Foundation hopes to build a Down syndromespecific centre in Macarthur to ensure that these children and their families receive all the therapies and support they need. The centre would be the first of its kind in Australia and it would give these children a great start in life. Families would be offered weekly support groups, information, therapy and individual counselling if required. This support would continue throughout the child's life, with help for their schooling, independent living and assistance with employment during their adult years. The group is working hard to achieve this goal with the support of my community through many fundraisers and events throughout the year. I have two beautiful daughters myself, Mr Deputy Speaker, so I can imagine how daunting it would be to learn that your newborn child has Down syndrome, simply through the fear of the unknown. This can be one of the most difficult times in a parent's life, and new parents often struggle to find answers and assistance to manage their child's condition. The Right Start Foundation has been able to connect these new parents with others who have already been through this experience and who know how the health system works and where they can find useful information. The foundation has also been critical in providing early intervention and therapies that help many people with Down syndrome in my electorate. The Right Start Foundation has joined with KU Starting Points Macarthur to offer several Down syndrome therapies for competitive prices in one location each week. Physical therapy classes focus on motor development, speech therapy classes develop clear communication, and signing skills and occupational therapy classes give children the skills they need to lead full and independent lives. Medical treatment for Down syndrome children can only go so far, but early intervention and therapies help many people with Down syndrome live long, productive lives. During my work with these families I have been fortunate enough to see first-hand the passion that drives their commitment. This has resulted in an increased awareness and understanding of the condition in my community. TodayI would like to praise the members of Right Start who work so hard to make this world a better place for their beautiful children. I would like to encourage others in my community to show their support for these families too-especially on World Down Syndrome Day later this week. This group sets a wonderful example for other parents across my electorate. Their love for their children comes second to none. I am so proud of this group and what they have achieved for their beautiful children. I would like to wish the Right Start foundation all the best as they continue to raise awareness of Down syndrome to the people of Macarthur. La Trobe Electorate: Harmony Day Ms SMYTH (La Trobe) (09:51): This week is very happily bookended by Harmony Day and St Patrick's Day. As this year is my 30th year in Australia, I have had cause to reflect on what this country has offered to so many Irish and other migrants. I have been able to do so with many other members of the Irish community in Melbourne over the last week. In turn, those migrants, including the Irish, have helped build the social fabric of Melbourne and Australia. In many cases, they have also been key in building physical infrastructure, businesses, our education, health and even political systems. Australia offered my family a new home in the 1980s. It was at the height of The Troubles in Northern Ireland and the region was riven by internal conflict, violence and prejudice. As I have said before in this place, I am enormously grateful that my parents made the decision to immigrate, as it has given us opportunities that we would not have had in Belfast. But opportunity for migrants cuts both ways. Just as migrants and their families have benefited from the prosperity and living standards of Australia, this country and its citizens by birth have gained enormously from successive waves of migration. I went to school with many first-generation Australian-Italian and Australian-Greek children. Those children have, in many cases, gone on to pursue careers in things like teaching, the public service, business and research, benefiting Australian society enormously. They have had families of their own in many circumstances. Families from, for example, Vietnam who arrived in the 1970s and early 80s will have had a similar experience and new migrants of the last decade will no doubt replicate the very same pattern. At its most basic, our contribution is to our nation's economic prosperity; but our contribution is also to local culture, international cultural and business connections and social cohesion. Although the circumstances have changed a lot in Belfast, the peace process is something which needs constant vigilance and hard work. It is always a reminder to me about the fragile nature of trust in any society and the corrosive effects of prejudice. It is not enough merely to say that a society is egalitarian or to speak about multiculturalism as though it is something that exists as a settled fact. We can only be an egalitarian multicultural society for as long as we continue to work at it and speak up for it. The Northern Irish experience tells me that it is much easier to tear down a society's sense of trust and social cohesion than to build it up. I trust that our country will continue to be a place which recognises the tremendous good that has come, and the opportunities which still come, from Irish migration past and present, and the migration of others to our new shores. Organisations like the Casey multifaith group within my own community do very valuable work in promoting cultural and religious awareness and respect in what is a relatively new community. I commend them very much for that very practical work that they do through forums, media and events to promote cultural harmony. I wish all members the best for Harmony Day tomorrow. Bennelong Electorate: North Ryde quickly notice a firm line of separation between the commercial hub of Macquarie Park, which includes some of our country's biggest corporate names, and the quiet, leafy suburbia of North Ryde. The line is Epping Road, dividing the bustling university and shopping centre from schools, family homes, small village shops and children's playgrounds. Many families have established themselves in North Ryde over recent years, crafting their own interpretation of the great Australian dream. At the forefront is Tennis World. More than half of my life I have been visiting Tennis World, running coaching clinics for school students or just enjoying a casual game with friends. Whilst community health and recreation facilities have been demolished across the region, Tennis World has remained as a venue for school groups and local residents. Unfortunately, the shadow of development now looms large over this area and the local community battles the threat of high-rise construction crossing onto the southern side of Epping Road and consuming the Tennis World site. The New South Wales government has",188,Constituency Statements
180,Mr Alexander (Bennelong) (09:54,"As you enter the electorate of Bennelong youput forward a development proposal for one of the state's largest residential developments in order to activate the North Ryde railway station precinct. The vast majority of this development sits on vacant land on the northern side of Epping Road. I hold great concern about the crossing of that development over Epping Road and the proposed demolition of community recreation space. I have repeatedly made it clear to the local community that I do not support any development on the Tennis World site. Several months ago I had a private meeting with Premier Barry O'Farrell's chief of staff and policy director on the topic of traffic congestion and transport infrastructure. At the end of this meeting I took the opportunity to make clear my opposition to this part of the development. Perhaps after 16 years of state Labor government, I have become conditioned to think that such decisions are made in back rooms. Instead, I was immediately informed that there is no opportunity for anyone to influence any state infrastructure development outside of the established planning and consultation processes. As we watch the drama unfold at ICAC, this is a new way of doing business under the New South Wales coalition and it is to be commended. Several days ago, the Department of Planning and Infrastructure announced that a 45-day consultation period for the North Ryde precinct development has commenced. I will be informing all local residents that I will provide them with every level of assistance to put forward the strongest possible objection to development on the southern side of Epping Road. This unique barrier between the high-rise fast pace of Macquarie Park and low-rise family environment of North Ryde must be maintained. Lindsay Electorate: National Volunteer Awards (09:57): I recently had the pleasure of hosting an event to celebrate some of the most dedicated volunteers in my community who were recently recognised under the National Volunteer Awards. I congratulate all the recipients. Firstly, Nicola DeSilva. Nicola has volunteered her time at a local youth group at ImagineNations church on a weekly basis for over 10 years. I congratulate Nicola on the great contribution she has made as a youth mentor and supporter of charities. Our next worthy recipient was Trisha Drummond. Trisha is a valued member of the Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy Team. She is renowned for being hard working, humble, gentle and intuitive. I congratulate Trisha on her great work with families and carers. Recognised for his work as founding president of the Association of Bhutanese in Australia, Sydney, I congratulate Om Dhungel. Om has been actively volunteering for many years assisting the Bhutanese community in sport, education and employment. Acknowledged for his many years of community activism, I congratulate Keith Heggart. As a youth mentor, member of the rural fire service, union representative and teacher, Keith has always gone above and beyond the call of duty. I thank Keith and congratulate him for his great contribution. Our next recipient, Rossco Hutchison, has had a tireless commitment to the Penrith community over many years. Rossco has dedicated his life to assisting those who need it most in our community.

Tom has made an invaluable contribution to our ex-servicemen's associations, RSL clubs and many other charitable groups. I congratulate and thank Tom for his many years of service. I congratulate Alexis Leones, a strong advocate for the Filipino community in the Penrith region and beyond. Alexis was recognised for her tireless work to raise awareness of the Philippine language and culture. Our next worthy recipients were Alan and Gabrielle Moran. Alan and Gabrielle run prostate cancer support groups to provide assistance to newly diagnosed cancer patients, survivors, sufferers and carers. I thank them for all their efforts to improve the lives of others in our community. I congratulate Jo-Ann and Michael Morris, acknowledged for their many roles supporting children. As foster parents themselves, and in forming the Samuel Morris Foundation, Jo-Ann and Michael have made a profound impact on our local community and are very worthy recipients of this award. I congratulate Norma Nolan, recognised for her voluntary service to Lifestart Nepean. Norma offers advice and support to families of children with disabilities and is a greatly valued member of the community. Finally, I congratulate Raylene Vidler, who has worked for McDonald's in various roles over the past 34 years and has contributed so much of her own time and resources, especially to Ronald McDonald House Charities. the time for constituency statements has concluded.

I rise to speak on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2013. The bill seeks to amend five acts across three portfolios. This is the 13th financial framework legislative amendment bill since 2004. It was an important process initiated by the Howard government and it is really a maintenance program. The last in the series that was passed in the House was just recently, in February. The bills are typically non-controversial in nature and tend to address a lot of housekeeping issues from legislative anomalies and text errors to bringing greater clarity to certain bills, giving consistency and efficiency. This bill is no exception in that regard. Briefly, there are three areas that are addressed in this bill. Firstly, it attempts to remove any constitutional doubt about the Commonwealth's existing involvement with 20",191,Constituency Statements

183,Mr Robb (Goldstein) (10:06,"I apologise for causing the delay in proceedings in this Commonwealth initiated companies such as Medibank Private and the Australian Submarine Corporation and it is a response to the High Court ruling of the Williams versus Commonwealth case relating to the School Chaplaincy Program, which ruled that there must be clear enabling legislation for moneys to pass from the Commonwealth to the states. I think the Commonwealth government contest the decision of that High Court case, so, as a measure to remove any doubt, they have taken certain amendments in this bill to provide clear enabling legislation. Secondly, there are amendments to formalise a recoverable payments framework for inadvertent payments or overpayments made by agencies to recipients who are not entitled to receive them. Finally, there are amendments relating to the transfer of tax losses from the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme to the ARIA Investments Trust. This stems from the government's decision to consolidate the trustees of the Commonwealth's main civilian and military superannuation schemes in May last year. It is not surprising that there are subsequent amendments to that legislation. Deputy Speaker, you might recall that at the time there was a lot of angst and concern about the speed of it all and the nature of the decision and the policy changed. As I say, it is not surprising. This is one issue which is characteristic of so much of what this government has done, in that it has rushed and failed to have proper consultation in so many areas. We are seeing it in the parliament right now with this media legislation. We see it in the superannuation area, particularly the tax gouges, the changes and the breaking of promises about maintaining certainty-another manifestation of that. Certainly, if we get the privilege of government sometime this year, one of the driving intents of our approach to policy and policy change will be to restore a sense of stability, certainty and constancy, and when decisions are taken not to then after the event keep changing the rules. That is damaging so much potential investment in this country, and in many ways it has caused subsequent revenue problems for this government because of the uncertainty that that has been generated by the legislative process in this place and the endless changes that are taking place. They are the main areas the bill addresses. The coalition find them non-controversial, necessary changes, and we support the bill. (10:10): I thank the member for Goldstein for his contribution to the debate on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2013. This bill will amend five acts across three portfolios. It will authorise the Commonwealth to form or participate in forming companies. It will also establish a framework to address certain technical overpayments made from certain special appropriations. Lastly, it will allow deferred tax asset relief to the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation in relation to the transfer of assets from the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme to the ARIA Investments Trust.

184,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay,"Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation)Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards (Registration Fees) Bill 2013 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. and Standards (Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2012. In talking to this bill, I would like to propose a number of enhancements beyond what is in this bill that I think would support the reliable and cost-effective implementation of what is a good idea-an initiative instigated under the previous coalition government. The bill before the parliament today allows the minister to determine changes to the WELS scheme without those changes requiring endorsement at state and territory level through their own legislation. As I mentioned, the WELS scheme is a proud achievement of the previous, coalition government. In 2005, the coalition government created the world's first national scheme of its kind, providing for water efficiency labels on shower heads, washing machines, toilets, dishwashers, urinals and taps. These labels give consumers an easy-to-understand star rating and water consumption information on the water efficiency of different products. This was all about empowering consumers so they can make better decisions in terms of their purchase of water and waterrelated articles and fittings. This bill amend the WELS Act to allow the Commonwealth minister to determine more of the scheme's details, particularly those relating to the registration of products and cost recovery. This differs from the current position in that some aspects of the scheme, such as the five-year period of product registration, cannot be changed without changing nine sets of legislation. The minister will make changes by disallowable legislative instrument, the terms of which must be agreed by the majority of states and territories-and, as we know, there is an opportunity for the parliament to dissent from those instruments if they are unbecoming. If the bill is passed it is expected that the minister will make a number of changes to the WELS scheme including revising registration fees to meet the cost recovery target of 80 per cent, which the industry finances through fees set against users of the WELS system to pay for its administration. Further amendments are proposed in the bill to the enforcement provisions of the WELS Act. I will talk more about that in a few moments. Civil penalty provisions have been added to provide a more cost-effective enforcement response. The bill will also apply strict liability to more provisions because it is currently difficult to prove intent in relation to breaches of the act-for example, not labelling a product properly. Some other changes of an administrative nature have been made, and some of them reflect on the practical experience of implementing the scheme, such as the need to remove the requirement for gazettal of registration decisions and instead requiring decisions to be published on the WELS website, and providing for further reviews of the operation of the WELS scheme at five-year intervals. The coalition supports this bill as it builds on and improves a successful scheme that was first introduced by the coalition. I turn to aspects of the regulatory and enforcement overreach that I think is happening under the current arrangements. In my travels with my coalition colleagues I have met with those directly at the coalface in the use of the WELS scheme-I am talking primarily about",193,Bills
185,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (10:12,"I rise to speak about the Water Efficiency Labellingretailers and wholesalers of water technology that is covered by the WELS legislation. I thank a very impressive business owner, Glenn Powell of Who Bathroom Warehouse at Varsity Lakes in Queensland, for walking me through what the practical implementation measures look like from the point of view of a small business seeking to work within the WELS framework. As a business owner, he and his team are very keen to meet the needs of their customers, so they are very oriented towards providing relevant information that helps inform consumer decisions. Glenn has a display facility in one of the main areas, and Ms Andrews, the local member, took me there and we sat down and had a chat. In that facility there are probably at least 100 items on display. Some of them are displayed in homelike environments so people can get a sense of the look and feel of the different articles available through Glenn's business. The majority of the items are presented in what would be a more familiar retail arrangement-not a display arrangement but more of a retail arrangement where customers can identify the item they wish to purchase and take it to the cash register. Where you actually get the item from the stock, from the shelving areas, there is no question about the labelling-every item is labelled; every individual product that is covered by the WELS scheme complies with the requirements. The display area, where you get the look and feel and the feng shui of what your bathroom or your kitchen might look like, is beautifully done, overwhelmingly so, and the products also carry WELS information on swing tags and the like. A WELS inspector attended this business and observed that six of the items did not have a swing tag on them. There was no malicious intent, no ambition to deceive the customer-as I mentioned, Glenn Powell and his dedicated team are very keen to provide all the consumer information that customers might want. But in this case some swing tags were missing. It did not matter that if you saw an item you were attracted to you would walk over to the shelved area and lift it out. Before any purchase was made the consumer would have been fully informed of the information that the WELS scheme seeks to communicate. But taking the item off the shelf and seeing the information before buying the article was not enough-there were six articles that did not have a swing tag on them. When this scheme was conceived under the former Howard government I believed that that kind of strict non-compliance could easily have been addressed by some encouragement to put a swing tag on the items, so that the display item and the stocked item, within reach of the customer-the article which a customer would grab and see the WELS information on before making a transaction or decision to purchase had been made-carried the same information. There was not a swing tag on six of the articles, but would it not have been better to say, 'We notice you have done a terrific job with all the point-of-sale information at the point where you reach for the packaged article to take it over to the cash register; good job to you, Glenn, and your team-but on six items there are no tags.' Who knows what might have happened. Someone might have lifted the swing tag off to actually write down the article. Or, heaven forbid, they might have gone through a Swedish furniture manufacturer and marketer that you are all very aware of where you are encouraged to take the tag off the display item to go and connect it up with the stock item that you get when you buy it. For those people who are familiar with that kind of experience, they may well have just lifted the tag off and gone over to the area where the WELS material is on the packaging and thought, 'This is the article I want because I've got the tag.' Or there might have been a lag time and it not going back, or they might have pocketed it or they might have written down a phone number on it. They might have done anything to it. The bottom line is that there was not a swing tag on that article but there was on the box that you actually buy. What happened? What happened was that Glenn-and I thank my colleague-got smashed. He was told that he was now subject to a fine of potentially $6,000 per breach$36,000 for the six swing tags not on the display item. But all of the WELS materials that you would hope would be available, and which the law says should be available to the consumer, they are staring at them on the package they would pick up to go and purchase it. So there is no lack of information-but no swing tag. There is a $6,000 fine for each breach. The staff member was very courteous. I do not have their name, and it would not add anything to the debate if I did. They pointed out that that is what the law said and they had very little wiggle room-to deviate from the strict prescribed requirements put them at risk of a $6,000 fine for each breach. But there was an option. There was a $36,000 fine hanging over the head of a small business. We all know things are pretty tough in small business and there are no sloppy margins around anywhere. You can pay the fine or you can enter into a voluntary undertaking which was an enforceable undertaking. Once you had entered into, if you deviated from it, guess what? Here come the fines again. So here is a small business person doing all that the parliament could ask of them in giving effect to a scheme designed to inform consumers, entirely in keeping with his business mode and meeting all the requirements on the shelved items that people would purchase-but on the funky presentation in the showroom area someone might have pinched the six tags and done the IKEA trick: 'I want one of those.' 'Okay, we've got one of those.' They go for the shelf. 'See this? There are all the WELS labels. Great.' But that was on the tag you have got, too. Because it did not go back, or whatever happened to the tag, there was a $36,000 fine. And then the enforceable undertakings come in. Glenn did what was required of him. They said, 'You need to produce a compliance training program.' He said, 'Who am I training? AmI training my customers not to pinch the tags like they are taught to do at IKEA? Or am I training me, when I fully know of these obligations? That is why I spend so much time meeting them.' This is a guy who had flagged to the department that he had imported an article for display that he did not think had been registered. He was proactively working collaboratively with the department. This is not someone trying to flinch on his responsibilities, yet he gets told to do an enforceable undertaking. Well, that enforceable undertaking has cost him absolutely thousands. He was instructed to produce a compliance training manual-and I have the handsome beast here. Do you think there would be a template on the website? Do you think every plumber, retailer or wholesaler within the country has the wherewithal to produce one of these manuals? There is actually useful feedback coming back to him about a range of things that were included in the manual, all the way down to the form, the text and the style-many of the lifts from the legislation-that he is fully aware of. But how do you train the customers not to pinch the tags? That must be in the next edition! Let us work collaboratively with Australian small businesses to achieve the public policy objectives of this scheme-that is, to communicate to consumers information relating to water products in terms of their water efficiency and performance. Let us work collaboratively. Here is a guy who I respect and admire for his courage in being involved in small business at a time when this government has no inclination whatsoever to assist him. There are cost pressureshe has got to be top-class in his customer service. He aims to achieve that. He has got his business set up in such a way that you cannot help but have the WELS information hit you in the face, because that is what is on the packaging of the article you wish to purchase. But, in the funky display areas-where there are those people who like to watch home renovation programs or want to get a feel for the size, shape and the feng shui of their purchase-six of these swing tags swung off. I do not know why and neither does he. He is alert to the need for them to be there, yet a $6,000 fine is just completely over the top. There is the suggestion that you can voluntarily go into an enforceable undertaking. I think this publication might have cost him $12,000 to produce. He now has to get himself audited every three months, because of the swing tag. He proactively contacts the department to identify plumbing items which he does not believe have been registered to assist the department with its work. He can look forward to routine raids to make sure he is doing okay. He has got a higher infringement notice risk available to him that could add up to over $100,000. I would have thought the best thing to do was say to Glenn: 'You've clearly embraced the spirit of the scheme. You share our motive to have customers aware of what is going on. Do you know a couple of those swing tags are missing? We know that a customer can't help but see the WELS information before any purchase because it is on the packet. Once they see something they like, they can reach for it and there it is. We'd like it to be on the articles themselves.' He would say, 'Me too'. We systematically have people run through the store to make sure customers are aware that the IKEA training of pinching the tag-so that you go and buy the article that is the one that is on display-might set him up each time for a $6,000 fine for each breach-and, if he does not pay that fine, he has got a voluntary enforceable undertaking that is about as voluntary as a gun to the head. I think we can do better with this scheme. This bill talks about a review. Let's have a look at a more collaborative, engaging and shared purpose approach to the implementation of this arrangement-not this arrangement, which I think is a regulatory and enforcement overreach that serves no good purpose, that sets up some tension between agencies that should have a shared purpose. It is just way too much for small business to have to cop when they are trying to do the right thing. debate this order of the day concurrently with the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment (Registration Fees) Bill 2013. If there is no objection to that I will allow that course to be followed. Standards (Registration Fees) Bill 2013 and the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment (Registration Fees) Bill 2013. Just listening to the member for Dunkley, I have a great deal of empathy and sympathy for the businessperson that he was referring to. It would seem to me that, in administering this kind of legislation, there ought to be a degree of common sense, and I think the member for",194,Bills

187,Mr Zappia (Makin) (10:28,"I speak in support of the Water Efficiency Labelling andDunkley quite appropriately outlined the compliance regime that is currently being practised as opposed to perhaps the way it ought to be. I certainly share his concerns if that is what is happening within the industry, because it is my view that that was never the intention. This legislation, which was brought in in 2005 by the Howard government, is all about setting up a water efficiency labelling system which will do several things. It was done in conjunction with the states-in fact, there is complementary legislation in each of the state and territory jurisdictions. I believe that the intent to comply with the legislation started on 1 July 2006. There was a six-month period which gave businesses the opportunity to adjust to and dispose of stock that had previously come in that was unlabelled but, after that, all businesses were expected to comply with the legislation. The legislation is all about putting labels on products to determine their water efficiency rating. If they have a higher rating, more stars are attached to the product. The intent of that is very important. It enables consumers to make choices about what products they buy and I believe they make those choices on two very important grounds. Firstly, they make the choices on the ground that they will save water. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I believe consumers are making those choices because they want to do the right thing by society and consume less water if that is at all possible. Also, in the consumption of less water we also consume less energy. I speak to people on a regular basis who are concerned about the environmental impacts of the way we live today, and anything that they can do to reduce those impacts they do because they care about the future of the planet. It has been estimated that, through this system alone, in the years ahead-by the year 2025 or thereabouts-we will save about 100,000 megalitres of domestic water use each year, 800,000 megalitres of total water use across the country and about 400,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year as a result of using water much more efficiently than we are. We will do that by enabling products to be marketed so that people can make those choices. Currently, there are about 18,000 products that have been labelled and are on the market for the very purpose of enabling consumers to choose which they use, and consumers are certainly taking advantage of that. It is not only domestic products, like washing machines, dishwashers, shower heads and the like. These efficiency products go right through to industry in a commercial sense as well. Some of the most impressive changes that I have seen over the years in respect to water efficiency measures come from the industrial sector. Industries also use a lot of water and many of them, from both an economic point of view and an environmental point of view, have made decisions that enable them to use water more efficiently. Those decisions come at a cost initially upfront, but I have no doubt that in the long term those costs are recovered as a result of using less water. The classic case that perhaps all of us see on a daily basis is of the operators of the car-washing facilities around the country who today, instead of discharging that water once it is used into the system and allowing it to drain away, have systems in place where they reuse that water and then it gets used for the washing of other vehicles. The same applies with respect to many other facilities that use washing down procedures in their daily business operations. Many of them are also now in a position as a result of investments that they have made to reuse that water rather than seeing it go to waste and ultimately polluting our waterways when that water reaches the oceans, into which most of it is discharged. I commend those businesses and those industries that have done exactly that because that is the way we should be going. The other area that I commend for the work that has been undertaken over recent decades in water efficiency is the irrigators on our farms. I believe that the irrigators on our farmsand I notice the member for Riverina is here right now-have been at the forefront of making efficiency gains in the way they use water on their farms. They have done that twofold: by looking at the agricultural methods that they use in the products they grow and also by investing in new irrigation systems and monitoring systems which enable them to use the amount of water that they need without wasting any and to get the most effective results from it. I certainly do commend them because, as we looked at the Murray-Darling Plan and how we could save water, water efficiency investment was the priority in terms of how we should be making those gains. I believe that we can learn a lot from the irrigators who have already made those investments and also carried out the research. In a world where the population is growing and there is a need to grow more food, and combining that with climate change, there is likely to be even less water available in some parts of the world. So we know that we have to be much smarter in the way that we use water. In fact, it has been suggested that most of the conflicts in the future will arise as a result of water shortages. Therefore, if we are going to be smarter in the way that we use water, we have to look at systems that empower consumers to use more efficient systems, and that is why systems like the WELS system are so important: it rates a product on its water efficiency. In order to rate a product it clearly has to be assessed, and in order for the system to work it also has to be monitored. WhilstI appreciate the comments of the member for Dunkley, it does have to be monitored. Monitoring the system comes at a cost. To date, my understanding is that the recovery of those costs is at about 20 per cent. The intent is and always was, from the day this legislation went into the House in 2005, to recover about 80 per cent of those monitoring and compliance costs. The intent of this legislation will enable us to move from 20 per cent to around 80 per cent cost recovery. My understanding is that the last 20 per cent will come from a combination of state, territory and federal government revenues. In order to get to that 80 per cent, this legislation of course will mean that additional costs will be imposed due to be compliance process that will be implemented. The process itself should be, as the member for Dunkley quite rightly outlined, one where common sense is applied. This is a responsibility not only on the federal government but also on the state and territory governments. I appreciate the fact that they will meet 10 per cent of the remaining 20 per cent of the costs to administer the program. Water efficiency labelling is something that has been embraced by the community at large. But it is fair to say that all people around the world have a responsibility when it comes to this. Finally, for the manufacturers of the products, the rating system will undoubtedly be a very strong and powerful marketing tool. I said earlier how consumers today are looking for more efficiencies in terms of both cost savings and responsibility for the environment. Because the rating system will be used by consumers to choose products, it will be an important marketing tool for them. The last thing we want to see is the rating system abused by unscrupulous manufacturers-or unscrupulous retailers for that matter-who simply want to rate a product at a higher rate than it is entitled to because they know full well that the rating will enable them to sell the products. So it is important that if we are going to have a rating system in place, the rating is true to the labelling. For that reason, the compliance system has to be put into effect. If we did not have a system in place, it would be unfair on those manufacturers of products who have complied with the rating system, carried out the research and ensured that their product is true to the claims made about it and who have to compete with an alternative product where the claims do not stand up to scrutiny. From both points of view, it is important that the rating system can be relied upon and has integrity, and therefore the compliance mechanisms that are in place need to be carried through. I end where I began: I agree that we need a compliance system that we can have confidence and faith in, but I also believe that it ought to be applied with a degree of common sense. I commend the legislation to the House. member for Makin once again-as far as a piece of legislation is concerned-and certainly with his comments on the water efficiencies of irrigators. I know how much work he did to save water when he was the Mayor of the City of Salisbury in South Australia. Much of the water savings measures conducted throughout this great land of ours in recent times have been with the objective of providing water to South Australia. We heard the minister for water only yesterday talking in the parliament about the final day for any disallowance to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Last year, in the last week of parliament, I moved a disallowance to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, and I stand by what I did then. But water is, as the member for Makin pointed out, so important to us all, and I certainly concede that water is as important to South Australia as it is to any other state. We need to make Commonwealth decisions in the national interest when it comes to water. I know that one of the great pioneers of water and irrigation, Sir Samuel McCaughey, is going to be honoured soon with the unveiling of a marvellous statue in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, where he did so much work to enhance irrigation and thereby give that particular region the ability to grow food, because you cannot grow food without water. Water is life; life is water-we all know that. One of Sir Samuel's famous sayings was 'Water is more precious than gold'. I concur with the member for Makin when he says that future conflicts will be fought over water. That is the reality. We talk a lot in this place about mining, but I do not think we give enough credit and priority to that most precious resource, which is of course water. I heard the member for Makin loud and clear when he said that the priority of this parliament should have been watersaving measures and water-saving infrastructure. I am sad to say that, for every dollar the federal Labor government has spent on water-saving infrastructure, it has spent $5 on water buybacks, which do nothing but rip out the lifeblood, the economics, and the ability of regional communities to make money and grow food to feed our nation and other nations. We are talking about the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards (Registration Fees) Bill 2013 and the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment (Registration Fees) Bill 2013, and it is important legislation. In 2005, the coalition government created the world's first national Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards scheme, or WELS scheme, providing for water efficiency labels on dishwashers, urinals, taps, toilets, shower heads and washing machines. These labels give consumers easy-to-understand star ratings and water",197,Bills
188,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (10:39,"I find myself in furious agreement with theconsumption information on the water efficiency of various products. The scheme has been generally accepted and supported by industry, although some believe that the scheme has not been stringent enough in dealing with non-compliant products. Yet others complain about the high cost of administering the scheme. We heard the member for Dunkley, just a little earlier, talk about a Queensland retailer, Glenn Powell, who was in some difficulty because the swing tags were removed from six of the products in his store and he faced a $6,000 fine for each and every one of those six swing tags removed. We all know that consumers go into stores and sometimes take things, like taking swing tags to the shelf to see that they match up with a product or to another store, thinking that it has a price on it and they can perhaps get a better deal. Sometimes they just take them so that they have the information-maybe a phone number that they can call to get some more information. For whatever reason, we find ourselves in a situation where sometimes stores are hit with high fines for not being compliant, when really a little bit of common sense by the compliance officer would make so much sense. We do live in a nanny state and hopefully after 14 September 2013, when hopefully the coalition will be elected to government, that nanny state that we are currently living in will be lessened. We have an amendment bill before the parliament at the moment to stop undercover operatives having to wear hi vis vests in Afghanistan. In my own electorate I heard the other day that people who are pallbearers and are carrying caskets from funerals have to do a three-day course to carry the coffins on their shoulders, otherwise it must be at waist level. I hear you laugh, but this is the ridiculous state which we have becomeAn honourable member: It just doesn't have a lot to do with the water bill-waist level! and people are being forced to endure is just ridiculous. The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards (Registration Fees) Bill 2013 will enable the minister to set registration fees under the WELS Scheme based on the whole cost of the scheme. The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Scheme Amendment (Registration Fees) Bill 2013 makes consequential amendments to allow the fees to be recovered in the form of a tax or levy. All scheme costs may be taken into account in setting the fee, including, but not restricted to, costs to do with processing registration applications, compliance monitoring and enforcement, policy, standard development and communications. In the absence of these changes, the registration fees could cover only the costs of service provision, instead of the entire costs of the scheme. Combined, these bills implement the decision of the Standing Council on Environment and Water in November 2011 that the scheme should recover 80 per cent of its costs from registrants. This will represent around $1.7 million per annum. The quantum of the fee will be set by the federal minister in a legislative instrument after consultation with the states and territories. The coalition established the WELS Scheme and continues to back it. Despite that, these changes envisage a rise in government fees, or in effect represent a levy or a tax on the industry to recover the costs of administration. Indeed, many are concerned that the government setting of the fees is unaccountable to the industry or consumers. There is nothing surprising in that sentence-'government' and 'unaccountable'-because those two words go hand-in-hand. For example, this bill allows the government to recover all of the costs of the scheme even though the Council of Australian Governments agreement was for only 80 per",200,Bills
189,Mr Mccormack,"Some of the occupational health and safety nonsense that businessescent to be recovered. The government says it intends to recover only 80 per cent of the costs, but sometimes what this government says and what this government actually does are generally, Member for Flinders, two entirely different things, as you would well know. Some believe that the proposed fees are too high and could be lowered if the government administered the scheme in a more efficient way. For these reasons-and they are important reasons-the coalition has referred these bills to a Senate inquiry. The coalition supports the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Scheme and the government should recover the appropriate costs it incurs to administer the scheme. However-and this is important-this must be done in an efficient and effective way. I see the minister for water has arrived, and he knows how important water efficiency is. He, of all people, knows how important it is so that we save as much water as possible. He would be very interested too, because he was not in the chamber when the member for Makin was praising irrigators and made reference to Riverina irrigators for the water efficiency that they have been doing for many years. They are using such things as laser levelling and drip measures to ensure that the water they use is going to where it is needed. It is not generally going in evaporation, and they are spending a lot of money. I would urge him while he is here to once again see where the taxation implications for irrigation corporations are up to, because in a press release on 18 February 2011 he promised that it would be fixed up in association with the regional development minister, Simon Crean-as men of their word, I take it that they will be doing something about it and they have given me an assurance that they will. I again urge him to look into that. I see him urging his advisers to do that. I am appreciative of that because I know that he knows how important it is that we get those implications sorted, so we can put in place that water savings infrastructure and make sure that South Australia gets its fair share of water, which I know the member for Makin wholeheartedly agrees with. As I say, it was a Liberal and Nationals government that introduced the first water efficiency labelling standards scheme in 2005. We did it because we know how important it is to save as much water as we can. I know Minister Burke knows how important it is to save as much water as we can, because there is nothing more precious in this country than water. We all know that and we need to make sure that we can save as much as possible. It is true to say that water efficiency comes at a cost, but it is imperative that we safeguard this cost from massive price rises, which makes efficient use of water unaffordable for farmers and householders. This bill will enable the minister to set registration fees based on the entire cost of the scheme. That is a bit of a concern. As I say, the government always needs to be accountableno matter when it sets taxes, levies, it has to be accountable. Compliance needs to have common sense with it for all those businesses which sell products with the star ratings under the WELS scheme. They cannot be smashed as the member for Dunkley pointed out a little earlier on. We need to have common sense, because businesses are the engine room, particularly small businesses, of our economy. They employ so many, many people. They pay enough taxes as it is. They do not need to be continually hurt by stupid, nonsensical compliance regimes. This is good legislation but it needs a little more thought. That is why we have recommended that it go to a Senate committee and, on those points, I will sit so that the water minister can make his valid remarks. water efficiency labelling and standards bill into the parliament. It involved a process which had been worked through with industry, with conservation and environment groups, with the bureaucracy and, in particular, with the plumbing and water efficiency sector. I think the bill transformed into legislation which has transformed into a system and a practice that has generally been very positive. It was designed and intended to provide a water efficiency and star rating system for washing machines, urinals, toilets, showerheads, taps-all of the basic water dispensing and water use devices in the household. It was a sensible, common-sense practical approach to efficiency and conservation. It was always designed and intended to be a low-touch scheme. It began that way, and we support the scheme. There are, however, two operative concerns, which I wish to raise in the presence of minister and those relate to what I would call an increasing use of this legislation for first-strike activities against small operators. I have met with small operators who in good faith have sought to comply with the legislation. They gave me examples of where they had one product with the WELS sticker on it, but the same product elsewhere in the store where it was not, and they had been either threatened or in some cases fined. This legislation is meant to provide a guide to consumers and its implementation has to be done in a way which is sensible and not threatening. I would request the minister to ask his department for a review on the implementation at the ground level. There ought to be a simple approach where if somebody is inadvertently in breach, they are requested to rectify. Fines should not be a part of that process. It is only when somebody has repeatedly and wilfully breached the notice and notification requirements that you would then turn to enforcement. It should not be a first-strike process. It should not be abused. The member for Dunkley, myself and others have encountered small-business people who felt that this legislation has been misused. It is good legislation, with a good intent, a good purpose and a good design. It is at the coalface where we need to review it to see whether or not there has been a practice of inadvertent over-regulation and inadvertent firststrike misuse. The second element that I want to raise, and again this has come from directly meeting with small-business participants in the water efficiency industry, is duplication. I think there is a legitimate question at this time to look at the interrelationship between the WaterMark system and the WELS system. Many plumbing and water goods suppliers have said that they feel there is a duplication. I do not come to this with a pre-emptive view as to the outcome. I think that both issues of the first-strike misuse and the potential for simplifying arrangements between the WELS and WaterMark system and any overlap and duplication ought to be considered by the Senate process. Both are genuine and legitimate concerns which have come from the implementation and the practice of the legislation. These are the real world examples provided first hand to myself which need to be considered. Against that background we then have the reforms within this legislation. It is a costrecovery measure. I am cautious about any cost-recovery measures. We will not stand in the way of it through the House. We will look at it with a cautious and sceptical eye. If it appears to be gouging then of course we would reject it. If it is a legitimate, modest cost recovery, and we will let the Senate inquiry take those examples, then we will accept it. We support the",201,Bills
190,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (10:52,"In 2005, I had the honour and the privilege to introduce thelegislation. We support the principle. We were the architects and we think that it is a sensible approach to water efficiency. But there are two genuine legitimate concerns in practice: one being in relation to the firststrike misuse of this legislation-and it may be some rogue inspectors or it might be a more widespread practice that has become overly oppressive. The second area is the potential for simplification and reducing the duplication, or eradicating duplication, in the relationship between the WELS legislation and the WaterMark systems. Against those areas for legitimate inquiry, I thank the minister for his attention. My impression is that he has noted that there are some genuine concerns at the grassroots level from small-business players who feel that what is reasonable legislation could be improved in its practical application.
