Wednesday, 28 October 2009 ----Cowan Electorate: St Anthony’s Catholic Primary School Catholic Primary School in Wanneroo to present an award to the school at their assembly. The award was for being the runners-up in the schools section of the Dorothea Mackellar Poetry Awards. As members may be aware, the Dorothea Mackellar Poetry Awards is the largest and in fact the oldest poetry competition for schools in Australia. The aim of the competition is to capture the imagination of students, inspiring them to express their thoughts creatively through poetry. The competition is named after Dorothea Mackellar, arguably our most famous poet and author of the famous poem My Country, and gives Australian young people an opportunity to strive for excellence in poetry. The awards are hosted by the Dorothea Mackellar Memorial Society, based in Gunnedah in north-west New South Wales. Four hundred and sixty-two schools participated, and I count it as a great achievement that St Anthony’s was second of all the competing primary schools in the entire country. Fourteen of the students submitted poetry, under the guidance of the gifted education coordinator and teacher, Sandra Corcoran. I presented an award that represented a telescope and a star, which reflected the theme, ‘Searching for stars’. Apart from the award, I also presented the school with a cheque for $750 and a number of books for the school library. After the school assembly, I met with the students. I acknowledge the success of Noah Ivulich and Tayla Short, from year 7. I say congratulations to Breana Kelly, Shannon Kelly and Elizabeth Simmonds, from year 6, and well done to Annette Briffa-Healy, Sian Douglas, Melanie Moroney and Keisha Omar, from year 5. The year 4s that did very well for the team effort were Bruce Patmore, Elaina O’Connor, Lauren Kincaid, Bronte Fresle and Shanelle DeLucia. The judges, in this case Dr Robert Kimber and Ms Sue Gough, made a comment about the better poetry in the competition, saying: It is emotion, deliberately given shape in the writer’s acute observations upon a theme which is very special to that writer at the time of writing. I take the opportunity of thanking the Dorothea Mackellar Memorial Society, project officer Helen Green and the judges for enabling this excellent competition to take place and upholding the standing of the literary arts in Australia, particularly poetry. I congratulate Mrs Corcoran and the 14 students for doing so very well in the national competition. I have always thought highly of St Anthony’s Catholic Primary School in Wanneroo, and I would particularly like to briefly comment on the confident and well-mannered students at the school. On the day I visited, I met and spoke to a number of the students. The older students were very respectful and yet had the confidence to speak with me. The younger students, while perhaps struggling to be confident in speaking to me, had no problem approaching me to receive their merit certificates and shake my hand. They are a credit to their parents, teachers and staff. Strong moral values are clearly embedded at the school. Once again I congratulate St Anthony’s Catholic Primary School, Wanneroo, for their success. I also congratulate MAIN COMMITTEE",218,Carbon Pollution Reduction Tunity Namely Kyoto It Is A Mistake To Ratify Scheme Amendment It It Clearly Shows The Schizophrenic Nature

Chifley Electorate: Building the Education Revolution Program tion program and the government stimulus package. I am very pleased to inform the House that, in the Chifley electorate, we have $140 million being spent by the federal government on Building the Education Revolution projects, a record amount. That $140 million is being spent at 66 schools, on 166 projects, including 82 projects in the National School Pride Program, at 66 schools, for a total of $11 million; 73 projects in the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program, at 49 schools, for a total of $116 million; and 11 projects in the Science and Language Centres for 21st Century Secondary Schools program, at 11 schools, for a total of $13½ million. This is a profoundly large amount of money benefiting so many schools in my electorate. The sad thing is that the coalition is opposed to this program. For the parents and citizens, the principals, the teachers and indeed the students, if there is an early election in 2010 there is no guarantee that these projects will be fully completed or fully funded, more is the pity. I went to Willmot Public School, which received $200,000 in the National School Pride Program, $400,000 for a new COLA and $1.3 million to upgrade their hall, which was in poor condition, and existing COLA. Parents there were absolutely delighted about the announcement. I met with students, who were very excited about such a large amount of money being spent on their school. Unfortunately, Peter Corney, who is the principal at Willmot, was away on school business that day, so Carmen Cefai, the deputy, took me around. I confess that I am a bit of a gardener and I noticed on my walk around Willmot that they are starting a vegetable garden. I am pleased to say that Dick Adams had given me some very good Tasmanian seed potatoes, not all of which I could use, and I subsequently donated some Tasmanian seed potatoes to Willmot. I am looking forward to the harvest and I hope I am not offending any New South Wales potato growers! Congratulations, Willmot. I know that this will make a profound difference to your public school. Mr Jason Stortz man in my electorate of Gilmore, Jason Stortz. Jason was tragically killed in a hit and run accident on Saturday, 17 October. He was cycling along Marshall Mount Road, training for an upcoming triathlon, when tragedy struck. I would like to start by offering my sincere and heartfelt condolences to Mr Stortz’s family, who know only too well that he is a man worth remembering. Jason was born in Shellharbour in 1970. He went to school in the Warilla area and when he was 17 he joined the Defence Force, where he served for nine years. The contribution he made to society and the sacrifices this involved should not be forgotten. Before he died, Jason worked for Kiama Council. His co-workers described him as an honest and genuine man who will be greatly missed. Jason’s family have revealed that he was recently accepted into the New South Wales Police Academy. I am sure he would have made a fine officer. Jason was also an active member of the local Kiama community. He was a committed member of the triathlon club, where he was well-respected and admired. Jason is survived by his wife, Kylie, and 15-month-old son, Harry, as well as his parents, four sisters and many friends. MAIN COMMITTEE",220,Constituency Statements

214,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (9.36 Am),"I rise to honour and recognise the life of a well-lovedI am very proud of the way in which the people of Kiama and surrounding areas have shown their support for Jason’s family at this difficult time. They turned out in their hundreds on the weekend to remember the life of this respected local triathlete at the place where he lost his life. It is a testimony to the kind of man Jason was that some 300 cyclists took to their bikes on this day as a gesture of respect. It certainly speaks volumes about how deeply the loss of his life will be felt in our community. Jason worked hard to provide for his family. He was just 39 years old when he passed away, far too young and with still so much to give. He was known for being an all-round good bloke, a loving husband, an affectionate dad and someone with a great sense of humour. Hundreds of people paid tribute to him on local websites and many have shared their memories of him as a disciplined man who was regularly seen running as he followed his personal training routine. This outpouring of love and appreciation I am sure brings great comfort to the Stortz family. I hope this formal recognition of Jason’s life and the high regard in which he was held bring some comfort to young Harry, who might one day read this in Hansard’s official records. I say to Harry: in years to come you will read this and understand just how proud we in the community are of your dad. Once again, I would like to extend my sympathy to all who have been left behind. My thoughts and prayers are with you all, and for me, the local federal member, it is an honour to represent you, Harry, and your family. My wish is that when you are old enough I can personally present you with a copy of this speech so you can see for yourself how much we respected your dad. sentiments. I congratulate the member for Gilmore on those great words. Corio Electorate: Museums If you visit any great city in the world you will find at least one grand church, an art gallery of note and a museum that defines that city in time and place. In Geelong we have fine churches, including a basilica and several churches with important links to the early history of the Victorian colony, we have an art gallery with an outstanding collection of Australian and European art from the 19th and 20th centuries and we have several local museums. Our National Wool Museum is particular to our city. The wool industry bankrolled the growth of Geelong. It marked us as a major centre for export at a time when Australia rode on the sheep’s back, and this museum celebrates that central theme of Australian settlement. We have a maritime museum with a commendable collection of artefacts that trace the importance of our maritime heritage, and the highly popular Ford Discovery Centre is a favourite not just for car enthusiasts but for the whole Geelong community as it celebrates our continuing connection with the Ford motor company since the 1920s. These museums each tell a part of Geelong’s history-our agricultural, maritime and industrial heritage. We have in the National Wool Museum a strong municipal museum, but we are missing a museum of true national importance. For a city the size of Geelong, and one with such historical richness, this is a sad fact. We need a museum with a significant collection and active exhibition spaces that connect us to our history but also engage with other museums around the country and indeed the world. MAIN COMMITTEE",221,Constituency Statements
215,The Deputy Speaker,I am sure the members of the Main Committee share in those,222,Constituency Statements
216,Mr Marles (Corio,"Parliamentary Secretary for Innovation and Industry) (9.39 am)Last week I toured our National Wool Museum. It has some outstanding display areas and is currently showing a terrific exhibition from Questacon. But it is many years since this municipal museum has had any major investment and its age is starting to show. If the Wool Museum is going to move forward, what direction should it take? I understand the City of Greater Geelong is currently undertaking a review of the museum, and I congratulate it for doing this. I think it is an ideal time for us as a city to think about the sort of museum we want for our city. Is it time to broaden the scope of the National Wool Museum and make it a national museum that is about more than just wool? There is ample space to retain the best of the current exhibits and build on these to include other permanent collections and space for special events. There is also scope to include the celebrated Customs House in the orbit of this plan. So today I call upon the City of Greater Geelong to hold a forum with civic leaders and other interested people to discuss the future of the museum. This is an exciting opportunity for Geelong to have a conversation about our history and our future and, in the process, create something that we can truly be proud of. McPherson Electorate: Stroke the Gold Coast Stroke Support Group, an affiliate member of the National Stroke Foundation and the Stroke Association of Queensland. The Gold Coast support group provides invaluable assistance to those who have suffered from stroke or know of someone suffering from the effects of stroke. The support group provides its members with up-to-date information and education in the areas of prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and support. While many of us know someone affected by stroke, I doubt many of us are aware of the true extent. Stroke is Australia’s second single greatest killer after coronary heart disease and a leading cause of disability. Stroke kills more women than breast cancer. In 2009, Australians will suffer around 60,000 new and recurrent strokes. That is one stroke every 10 minutes. One in five people having a first-ever stroke dies within one month, and one in three dies within a year. In the next 10 years more than half a million people will suffer a stroke. About 88 per cent of stroke survivors live at home and most have a disability. Close to 20 per cent of all strokes occur to people under 55 years of age. Stroke costs Australia an estimated $2.14 billion a year. Perhaps the most important fact is that, according to the Stroke Foundation, stroke is preventable. While finding the cure for threatening illnesses and diseases is unquestionably important, prevention always has been and always will be better than a cure. It is time that Australians got serious about preventative health measures. We need to start taking more responsibility for our own health. We need to educate ourselves and each other about prevention. As a nation, we need to increase our commitment to a healthy and active lifestyle. Given the volume of information provided through interest groups such as the Gold Coast support group, the National Stroke Foundation and the Stroke Association of Queensland, ignorance is no longer an excuse. For too long we have relied on hard working medical researchers to provide that lifesaving cure, while as individuals we absolve ourselves of any responsibility for our own health. It is imperative that we continue to raise prevention awareness. It is imperative that the great work of the Gold Coast support group is promoted and that the residents of the Gold Coast are aware of the preventive measures to reduce the risk of stroke. While certain sections MAIN COMMITTEE",222,Constituency Statements

These are all fundamental to reducing many of the risk factors. I commend the Gold Coast Stroke Support Group for the work they do and encourage people to get along to their meeting on 4 November to hear more about the great work they are doing. Ballarat Electorate: Creswick Ms KING (Ballarat) (9.45 am)-TodayI would like to highlight the fantastic work of the Creswick community and congratulate them again on the continued success of the Creswick Forestry Fiesta. This fiesta was held last weekend. It is now in its 14th year and is attended by not only the Creswick community but many in the surrounding district. Regional festivals and shows like this are run right across the electorate of Ballarat; in fact, we call this time of year show season because there are a number of them on. These festivals involve lots of hard work from volunteers and they are great contributors to the local economy and local tourism. The Creswick Forestry Fiesta proved once again be a hit and, although it was an extremely windy day, the highlight once again was the parade. I congratulate the many voluntary groups and primary schools for putting such an effort into the parade and the floats that they have each year. The festival is also a great opportunity for me to have a chat to local residents in an informal setting not only about what is happening around the district and to receive feedback about the issues and concerns but also to receive feedback as to what is happening in their community with the Rudd government’s investment both through the Building the Education Revolution and the Community Infrastructure Fund. In Creswick itself there has been over $6 million worth of projects funded and, as a small town, it is making a significant difference to that community. Creswick North Primary School received some $50,000 through the National School Pride program and $250,000 as part of the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program. Creswick Primary School has received $125,000 from the National School Pride program and $2 million under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program. The Catholic primary school has also received $75,000 from the National School Pride program and some $850,000 under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program. That is $3.35 million going into education infrastructure in a small country town. It is funding that not only I support but the families in Creswick also support. We have also funded the Creswick Interpretive Centre, a tourist information centre, which is now seeing many volunteers from the district help visitors who are coming in to see Creswick, Clunes and Daylesford as Creswick is the gateway to go through to the Clunes community. They have been very pleased with the investment of $450,000 from the Rudd Labor government. They are also very keen to see work start, and planning is well underway, on the Doug Lindsay Reserve, which has funding of $2.29 million under the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure program. As I said, in total the projects in Creswick have injected over $6 million into that local community. I look forward again to attending the Creswick Forestry Fiesta next year and again being part of a government that continues to support and place infrastructure funding MAIN COMMITTEE for local communities as such a priority. It really has made a significant difference to the small town of Creswick. AgainI would like to congratulate them on the work that they are undertaking and also for the Creswick Forestry Fiesta, which again was a terrific festival and I think that it was worth well worth attending. Stirling Electorate: Volunteers no more so than in my electorate of Stirling. Stirling volunteers play a vital role in maintaining the quality of life that we often take for granted. From the lifesavers at the two surf clubs, Scarborough Surf Life Saving club and Trigg Island Surf Lifesaving Club, to scout masters and the committed teams of workers preparing and delivering meals for our seniors, volunteers play an important role in all of our lives. It is because of the commitment of our volunteers that our children are able to enjoy and compete in organised sport, our ageing parents are able to engage with the community and our schools are able to offer a diverse range of support for our students. Without dedicated volunteers giving freely of their time and skills to fundraise, how would these extra costs be met? Our volunteers are helping to meet social and financial needs in our community every day. The benefits of becoming a volunteer and engaging with the community are many. The satisfaction and pride that come from giving to others is not to be overlooked or undervalued. Becoming a volunteer gives you the opportunity to make a contribution from a very young age. It gives you the opportunity to meet new people, build self-confidence, share life experiences and, most importantly, give back to your community. I have already listed some of the most recognised volunteer organisations, notably the surf lifesavers, but not all volunteer groups enjoy such a high profile and volunteers often go unrecognised despite the valuable contribution they make. TodayI want to acknowledge the great work of the volunteers in Stirling and thank them for what they do. At the same time. I would like to help promote their cause so that many people will be encouraged to participate in and experience the rewards of volunteering. Books on Wheels, a volunteer service operating from our city library, delivers library materials to housebound patrons, giving everyone the opportunity to share in the extensive range of resources on offer at the Karrinyup, Scarborough and Osborne libraries. New migrants in the Stirling electorate enjoy the great service provided by the volunteers at Mirrabooka’s Metropolitan Migrant Resource Centre. Uniting Church Homes in Karrinyup relies on its dedicated volunteers to work with occupational therapists to improve the mental and physical well-being of residents through activities such as craft, bingo and vocal exercises. The School Volunteers Program recruits, trains and supports volunteers to act as mentors to primary and secondary school students not just in my electorate of Stirling but right across Western Australia. The Riding for the Disabled Association of Western Australia in Carine is run by an enthusiastic team of volunteers that provide equestrian sport for disabled persons. Volunteers at the Animal Care Facility at the city of Stirling help find new homes for stray and unwanted animals while extending the message of responsible pet ownership throughout the community. Without the volunteers the Mount Flora Regional Museum would not be able to keep its doors open, Anglican Homes would be without their bus driver and the Salvos shop in Balcatta would be forced to close. Unfortunately I do not have time to list all of the fantastic volunteer groups in my electorate, but I would just like to say that I am very fortunate to live in a comMAIN COMMITTEE",223,Constituency Statements

TodayI rise to speak on that matter again and to talk about the launch on 7 October of the I Love the Central Coast campaign. Along with the New South Wales Business Chamber Central Coast division, represented by Mary Doherty, I was able to launch on 7 October this important campaign to change the institutions on the Central Coast to make sure that they have a focus on the Central Coast. Too many of our institutions are either Hunter based or Sydney based, and what happens for us on the Central Coast is that we end up missing out. I would like to acknowledge some of the people who are supporters of the campaign and were able to attend the launch or provide written statements supporting the campaign. First and foremost must be Laurie McKinna and the magnificent Central Coast Mariners, who have been right behind the campaign to have our region recognised and who do a great job in raising the profile of the area. I would also like to thank Dr Phil Godden from the Central Coast Division of General Practice. The Central Coast Division of General Practice is organised on a Central Coast basis, and he sees the need for us to organise all health on the Central Coast on that regional basis. I acknowledge Ms Sharon Brownley from the regional P&C, who again sees that education should be organised on a Central Coast basis rather than being, as it is now, organised out of the Hunter. We had Greg Florimo, who is heading the push to have the Central Coast Bears admitted into the NRL in a couple of years time. He was there to lend his support. Julie Goodwin, the winner of MasterChef, was there to lend her support, and she had some insightful things to say about how she constantly referred to the Central Coast when she was on MasterChef and people would say, ‘Where is that?’ She got a real sense that we were a region without an identity, and that has led to her great support for this campaign. John Singleton has been supportive as a local resident of the Central Coast in helping to push the identity. The mayors of both Gosford and Wyong councils have been supportive. The famous photographer Ken Duncan has lent his support, again, to this campaign. The surf lifesaving movement is an integral part of Central Coast life, and Chad Griffith from Surf Life Saving Central Coast was one of those who were there, again calling for recognition of this area. We also had there Kerry Ruffles, who works for the newly formed RDA, and Tourism Central Coast. I would also like to thank the state Liberal and Labor MPs who attended. Chris Hartcher from the Liberal Party was very supportive, as were Grant McBride and David Harris. This is a campaign that needs to succeed to make sure this region is properly recognised. Community Water Grants Mrs Margaret Jansen Swan last Friday, they held a community water grant recognition ceremony, which I attended. St Augustine’s School had received a community water grant to the value of $49,986, which was used to save water by installing tanks and efficient taps, toilets and urinals.

The project is projected to save 201,810 litres of water per year. I would like to thank the principal, Art Lombardi, for inviting me and commend the school for taking the time to think about water and apply for the grant. This grant is particularly timely given that the Western Australian government has just concluded a two-month winter sprinkler ban, which saved 50 million litres of water a day or 22 Olympic sized swimming pools. We are getting smarter about water conservation in Western Australia. The community water grants were of course a scheme provided by the previous government, and I note that the scheme has been discontinued as part of the transition to Caring for our Country-the scheme which has already stripped $2 million from Perth NRM’s budget. Grants were available for water-saving and efficiency, water recycling, and water treatment-improving surface and groundwater health. St Augustine’s funding was just the latest in a long line of projects funded under this scheme. Back in round 1, Lynwood Senior High School received $31,000 to install constant-flow valves on taps, to seal leaks and to adjust urinal flush volumes. In addition to this, the school will trial a waterless urinal. These changes have saved 658,050 litres of water each year. Lathlain Primary School received $45,000 to introduce a more efficient subsurface system allowing night watering and thereby reducing the rate of water lost through evaporation. The project saved 500,000 litres of water last year. South Kensington School received $22,000 to implement a range of water-saving initiatives in the school’s bathrooms to save 383,000 litres of water each year. Wesley College received two grants of approximately $40,000 and Carlisle Primary School a grant of $4,650 for similar purposes. I will take a moment to make special mention of Carlisle Primary School Principal Margaret Jansen, who is suffering from an illness at the moment. Margaret is terminally ill. She has done a fantastic job with her school. I recognise the fantastic work she has done and wish her all the best. I have had a close relationship with Carlisle Primary School and the people there, and Margaret in particular. I was pleased that she invited me to the anti-bullying launch at the school earlier this year. My thoughts go out to her and her family at this time. Round2 of the Community Water Grants closed in August 2006. It was highly competitive, with 4,532 applications submitted across Australia. Kent Street Senior High School received approximately $45,000 for water-saving devices in the school bathrooms. I commend the program that the schools have initiated and applaud them for taking part in it. Shortland Electorate: Cancer Information Session Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.57 am)-Last FridayI held a prostate cancer information morning at the Windale Gateshead Bowling Club. I would like to thank the Windale Gateshead Bowling Club for providing the facilities at their club free of charge and helping with the organisation of the day. I would like to thank also Professor Jim Denham, a senior staff specialist in radiation oncology in the Hunter. The morning was an outstanding success. It was an information session that brought together local health professionals and survivors to talk about the disease of prostate cancer, how it can affect men and their families, and what can be done about it. Prostate cancer impacts not only on men but also on their partners and families, and we encouraged men to bring along their partners with them to this session. MAIN COMMITTEE Prostate cancer is a potentially fatal disease that affects one in nine men. It is the most common cancer in Australian men and is the second most common cause of cancer death in men. Every year close to 3,300 Australian men die of the disease. Prostate cancer can be treatable with early detection. We had an enormous response to this information morning. We had outstanding speakers-as I said, we had Professor Jim Denham, who spoke at length and gave a very factual and detailed presentation on prostate cancer. Then we had Geoff Fry, who donated $1 million to establish a prostate cancer centre at Waratah in Newcastle. He spoke about his experiences with prostate cancer and how the knowledge he has received has helped him. He is now providing that information to other people. We had a counsellor, Aaron Elliott, who also spoke. It was such an outstanding success. It was the third one of these that I have done. On 13 November, I will be holding a breast cancer awareness morning tea. Talking at the morning tea will be Professor John Forbes, who is an absolutely outstanding and worldrenowned breast cancer specialist. We will be holding it at the Belmont 16ft Sailing Club and I thank the club for providing that venue. I will report back to the House on the success of the morning tea at the next session. I thought it was appropriate to announce it this week, Breast Cancer Awareness Week. 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 October, on motion by Ms Kate Ellis: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms MARINO (Forrest) (10.00 am)-I rise today to support the Australian Sports AntiDoping Authority Amendment Bill 2009, which seeks to amend the Australian Sports AntiDoping Authority Act 2006, the ASADA Act, to reflect new structural and governance arrangements for the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority. This bill implements recommendations of an independent review of ASADA, commissioned by the Department of Health and Ageing in 2008. The review found that the current structure was impacting on the ability of structure did not clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the ASADA chair, who was also the head of the agency and of the ASADA members. A number of recommendations and proposed legislative changes were made by the review to ensure ASADA operates solely as an agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. This will include an advisory group with a separate chief executive responsible for reporting directly to the minister. In line with the recommendations of the review, this bill will create a new ASADA chief executive officer position and a new advisory group to provide advice to the new ASADA CEO on sports doping, will establish a new AntiDoping Rule Violation Panel and alter the way the National Anti-Doping Scheme can be amended by the new CEO. The creation of a new CEO position and a new advisory group is being proposed to clearly define the roles and responsibilities within ASADA. The CEO position will be responsible for directing ASADA in carrying out functions prescribed under the ASADA Act, including fiMAIN COMMITTEE",226,Constituency Statements
221,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"Order! In accordance with standing ordernancial responsibilities normally expected of a CEO under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and the Public Service Act. The new advisory group created under this legislation will be just that: one with advisory functions. Members of the group will be appointed by the Minister for Sport and will have specialist skills in areas including education and training, sports medicine, sports law, ethics and investigations. It should be noted that members of the new advisory group will not be eligible for appointment to the CEO position. The new Anti-Doping Rule Violation Panel being created by this bill will replace the current Anti-Doping Rule Violation Committee. The new panel will have responsibility for making decisions in relation to anti-doping rule violations and provide recommendations on further action to the ASADA CEO and staff. The panel will consist of members with specialist skills, such as sports law, medicine and pharmacology. In a move to avoid any perception of conflict, the ASADA CEO, staff and members of the new advisory group will be ineligible to sit on the new board. The third major part of this legislation is an alteration in the way the National Anti-Doping scheme can be amended by the new CEO. The National Anti-Doping scheme ensures Australia remains compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code. When changes are made to the World Anti-Doping Code, the scheme is amended to reflect these changes. Under the current arrangements, ASADA can only change the scheme as a whole by way of a written instrument. Under the new arrangements, the CEO will still make changes via a written instrument, but the bill will include additional matters on which the CEO can make changes. These allow for changing sections of the scheme as opposed to changing the scheme as a whole. The coalition supports the intent of the bill. We need to ensure that Australia’s anti-doping efforts are operating to their maximum capacity. The former coalition government improved Australia’s anti-doping efforts by establishing ASADA in 2006 and giving it strong powers to investigate and present cases as well as exchanging information with other enforcement agencies. ASADA was given the power to investigate suspected anti-doping rule violations, make recommendations on its findings and present cases against alleged offenders at sporting tribunals. In 2007-08, the former coalition government provided an additional $2.24 million to tion and submission of briefs in relation to individual cases, bringing the total funding to $12.9 million. ASADA now conducts approximately 4,200 government funded tests each year. The former government also took a tough stance on illicit drugs in sport, which began in 1997 with the $1.6 billion National Illicit Drug Strategy, known as the ‘Tough on Drugs’ campaign. We launched the Stamp Out Doping hotline in March 2006 so that people could report information about possible doping in sport. We also established the Register of Findings in March 2006, which makes public the names of athletes who have committed a violation. The initiation of the Athletes Whereabouts Information Register was also implemented in March 2006 to further facilitate ASADA’s no-advance-notice testing program so that athletes could be located at any time and be tested. The policies of the former coalition government ensured that ASADA developed a strong international reputation as a world leader in best practice anti-doping regulations. The use of MAIN COMMITTEE drugs in sport is a widespread problem in Australia and worldwide. The Australian Prescriber in an issue of their publication said: As sport becomes more competitive some people are tempted to cheat to improve their chances of winning. People who cheat by abusing medicines may be banned from sport if they are caught. They are also risking their health. Some athletes have died because they abused medicines. Unfortunately, we hear about and see in the media well-known sports stars who are caught up in drug issues, be they performance-enhancing drugs or social drugs. I was really concerned to read an article by Sean Parnell in the Australian dated 13 March, 2008, which stated that a survey conducted by Curtin University showed that ‘up to 30 per cent of Australia’s top athletes believe they could get away with using performance-enhancing drugs if they wanted to’. The article also referred to ‘the rationale for ASADA’s tough stance on drugs, including its work with Customs, targeted testing and long-term storage of samples’. WhatI did note in the article, however, was the quote that ‘higher level athletes endorsed tougher penalties for doping, with 72 per cent of Olympic and world championship advocating a life ban for a second offence’. We all know that sport is part of our Australian identity and culture. Australians love sport. Just look at the numbers who regularly attend and participate in AFL, netball-like my colThe list is extensive and the numbers of us who watch and participate on a regular basis is also extensive. But I believe Australians also support the notion of a fair go, the level playing field. We are all aware of the health benefits of sport: families simply sharing the day together with their children, the social interaction, a way of building friendships and, hopefully, improving skills and physical fitness along the way. It is also a wonderful way for children to just have fun together. Sport can also assist in reducing antisocial behaviour. We know of these benefits. The value of sport in regional communities, though, cannot be underestimated. It is often the glue that brings communities together and holds them together. Sporting clubs also provide a sense of belonging for young people with problem backgrounds or those who are facing major challenges in their lives. They often find very genuine and caring mentors around sporting clubs. We need to also give as much confidence as possible to the parents of children that their children are safe pursuing the sport of their choice both when they are young and in their community club or their sporting environment and throughout their time in their chosen sport or sports. We also know the value that sport and regular physical activity have and how highly valued they are by both parents and children, but we need to encourage safe, healthy options and, for career athletes, an illicit-drug-free environment. Drugs, as we know, put lives at risk and threaten something that is often overlooked by those who engage: it threatens the quality of life both during and after the sport itself. I note that the World Anti-Doping Code includes such substances as anabolic steroids, various growth hormones, diuretics and masking agents, stimulants, narcotics and other drugs. Athletes will face tougher penalties, with all of the nation’s 91 sporting organisations signing up to the World Anti-Doping Agency code effective from 1 January. This international code, which is a prerequisite for Olympic participation, will double the ban from sport to four years for athletes caught intentionally doping.

222,League Mr Irons,"soccer, Rugby League and Rugby Union, cricket, the Olympics and golf.and assistance personnel, anyone involved in administering prohibited substances or athletes who fail a second doping test can now receive a lifetime ban. Athletes will also be tested for illicit drugs as well as performance-enhancing drugs on match day and will have to nominate a time period for random drug testing each day. I note that John Fahey, the President of the World Anti-Doping Agency, has said that ‘Australia sets a strong example in the battle against drugs in sport’. He also said: The information provided to ASADA by Customs and the Australian Federal Police allows a far greater likelihood of catching cheats than simply testing … I note the health and well-being of AFL players is a priority in the code’s illicit drug policy and on their website. Mr Irons would agree with that. AFL Players Association President Joel Bowden said: “AFL players are, no doubt, among the most highly-tested athletes in the world,” … … … “Not only do we have testing for performance-enhancing drugs with matchday in-competition testing, we also have out-of-competition testing with the illicit drug policy. “It is, no doubt, the most strenuous testing policy in Australia and to have such a [large] group of players volunteer for this shows that not only are they concerned about the image of the gamethat wonderful game of AFLbut also about the health and welfare of their fellow players.” “Illicit drugs are an issue in society and they can be a problem if you don’t get on top of a bad decision or a poor choice in your life and make some improvements to that behaviour.” Bowden said the strategy, which was formulated in consultation with respected medical practitioners and health professionals, had been effective in helping to improve player behaviour and education since its implementation. “I support the AFL’s illicit drugs policy because fundamentally it’s based on the best medical advice,” he said. “We’ve had the illicit drug policy in now for a number of years and we’ve seen that it’s changing the behaviour of our players and we’re having less numbers of positives including the fact that we’re having more tests. “So the medical experts have agreed that this is the best policy and we’re sticking by it. “The key benefit of the policy is [to] the health and welfare of our players. A priority, Mr Irons. That is paramount in any decision that we’ve made in coming to [the introduction] of an illicit drugs policy. “We volunteered for the policy a number of years ago and we feel that there are wide-reaching benefits across our group. We acknowledge that illicit drugs are an issue in society, we know this and we want to combat it by saying no to illicit drugs. “We’ve put the policy in place to make a firm stand that AFL players say no to illicit drugs.” AndI encourage them in that. With my personal significant interest in the AFL I encourage all players, coaches, trainers and personnel at every level of not only AFL but every sport to consider the health and welfare of players of all ages as their No. 1 priority as part of their duty of care. Often, our elite sports men and women have a limited time and opportunity at the peak level. There is much life after sport. There are many years of living beyond this highly comMAIN COMMITTEE petitive stage of your career or life. The longer term health and well-being of players should also be priorities for all involved, including the athletes themselves, who should take personal responsibility for the choices they make. Educating young athletes about the risks of drug use needs to become an integral part of each sporting code’s standard procedure. Several agencies at various levels of government are engaged directly in this issue, but at a local level in my electorate of Forrest there are a number of groups actively encouraging the public to say no to drugs. In a very simple way a local group of residents continually promote a ‘say no to drugs, say yes to life’ message through a series of informative booklets. The booklets are aimed at young people and teenagers. This group has a shared focus with the National Drug Strategy to minimise drug use through education targeted at the ages young people are statistically likely to be exposed to drugs. I am extremely supportive of the work and efforts in this field of this and other groups in my electorate. Given the continuing very serious issue of illicit drugs in sport and in society, the coalition endorses the restructure and governance arrangements for ASADA, and therefore supports this legislation. thority Amendment Bill 2009. I would like to acknowledge the contribution from the member for Forrest, but I correct her and say that I played AFL and not netball. Ms Marino-But you are good at both! who has competed in sport at high levels, and also the member for Cowan, who was a state representative. I saw them make their presentations here yesterday. I have had some experience of professional sport in this country, having played at a semiprofessional level for the east Perth football club in the Western Australian Football League. From my experience I can say the majority of sportspeople do not take performance-enhancing drugs. Like many matters we discuss in this place we have to cater for the minority that deliberately break the rules. All of us have seen the damage done to sports by athletes caught taking performance-enhancing drugs. On these occasions sport is often brought into disrepute and this makes it worse for everyone who is involved in the sport. The actions of individuals often blight a country’s reputation on the international stage as well. The allegations against double Olympic gold medal winner Maurice Greene compounded a series of allegations against US sprinters. Marion Jones, who we all remember winning five gold medals in Sydney, is now serving a prison sentence for perjury after admitting to taking drugs. Tim Montgomery set a world record of 9.78 seconds in 2002 but was banned in 2005 after he was implicated in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative, or BALCO, affair. Further back Ben Johnson was stripped of his gold medal at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul after winning the 100 metres in a world record time of 9.79 seconds. Jones and Montgomery were involved in the BALCO scandal, where athletes were accused of taking a concoction of performance-enhancing drugs, allegedly designed by the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative, to avoid being revealed in urine and blood testing. Five drugs in particular are alleged to have been used, including EPO, which is a human growth hormone, modafinil, testosterone cream and tetrahydrogestrinone, or THG.

224,Mr Irons,"Yes, thank you. I also recognise contributions from the member for Makin,Members will probably be most aware of EPO, which improves the ability of red blood cells to carry and transport oxygen. THG is a designer anabolic steroid, making the user bigger and stronger. This was the main drug distributed by BALCO and it ultimately proved to be the drug had brought down the organisation. BALCO sold the substances undetected between 1988 and 2002, until a US federal investigation began. At this time Don Catlin, the founder and then director of UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory, developed a testing process for the drug THG. He then proceeded to test 550 existing samples, of which 20 prove to be positive for THG. The BALCO scandal tells us two things. First, it demonstrates how the actions of a few athletes can tarnish the reputation of not only a sport but also an entire country. Members will also remember the case of Raylene Boyle, who was robbed of two gold medals, and Renatta Strecher, which tainted the reputation of the East Germans. After the wall came down, we all know about the endemic problems in their sport; it was all about achieving gold medals and not about looking after their athletes. Second, it demonstrates the need to keep a close eye on the organisations that provide assistance to our elite athletes. If a BALCO had been allowed to develop in Australia and provide assistance to Australian athletes the good name of Australian sport would have been tarnished. These both point to the importance of Commonwealth involvement in this matter, the need for strong anti-doping laws and an effective anti-doping organisation in Australia. I certainly support the intent of this bill, which attempts to provide for the latter. The bill is based on the recommendations of the independent review of ASADA, which was commissioned by the Department of Health and Ageing last year. ASADA has come under some criticism in the past, in particular for its handling of Ian Thorpe, who was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing. I would not want to cast any aspersions on this case, but I accept that there are ways in which the structure of ASADA can be improved. I want to briefly make reference to the three main effects that this legislation will have. Firstly, the legislation will create a new ASADA chief executive officer to replace the chair and head of the agency and a new advisory group that will clarify the roles and responsibilities within ASADA. The Minister for Sport is to hand-pick this advisory group, which usually raises alarm bells when this government is concerned. This is of course the same government that gave us Professor Stuart Macintyre, a former Communist Party member, whose work includes a history of Marxism in Britain, and that promoted him as an independent voice on education, capable of designing a national curriculum. So we will be keeping an eye on the minister’s appointment for this ASADA position. The second part of this legislation is to establish a new antidoping rule violation panel, which will have responsibility for antidoping rule violations and provide recommendations on further actions to the ASADA CEO and staff. The third component that this legislation will alter is the way the National Anti-Doping Scheme can be amended by the new CEO. This is generally a technical amendment, whereby the new CEO will be able to make changes to the National Anti-doping Scheme, as opposed to the former system where changes had to be made by written instrument. The changes are fairly uncontroversial and, as I said before, the coalition supports the intent of this legislation. We want to ensure we are getting the most out of our antidoping efforts. We are the party that implemented ASADA in 2006, and I note that it has developed an MAIN COMMITTEE international reputation as a world leader in best practice antidoping regulations. We are committed to the National Anti-doping Scheme, which ensures that Australia remains compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code. The practice of taking performance enhancing drugs goes back a long way. The Parliamentary Library have even traced the practice back to the use of hallucinogenics by the ancient Greeks. However, it was the death of an athlete at the 1960 Olympic Games which prompted a process of establishing guidelines relating to what constituted illegal performanceenhancing drugs. This eventually led to the establishment of the World Anti-doping Agency in February 1999. The Australian government was a signatory to the WADA Code and the International Convention against Doping in Sport and as such was required to implement codecompliant anti-doping policies. At this time the Australian Sports Drug Agency was only responsible for drug education. All investigations into the use of performance enhancing drugs were undertaken by the relevant sporting bodies in conjunction with the Australian Sports Commission. A much criticised investigation by Cycling Australia and the ASC in 2004 prompted the Commonwealth to create ASADA-the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority. Today the World Anti-Doping Code 2009 states: Anti-doping programs seek to preserve what is intrinsically valuable about sport. The intrinsic value is often referred to as the spirit of sport; it is the essence of Olympism; it is how we play true. The spirit of sport is the celebration of human spirit, body and mind and is characterised by the following values: ethics, fair play and honesty; health; excellence in performance; character and education; fun and joy; teamwork; dedication and commitment; respect for rules and laws; respect for self and other participants; courage; and community and solidarity. Doping is fundamentally contrary to the spirit of sport and undermines all of those beliefs. I agree with each of these points. My priority as a member of parliament and the director of junior development for Perth Football Club is to pass this message on to youngsters. This is partly about having a zero tolerance approach on the topic of performance enhancing drugs in Australia. Catching the cheats does send a strong message to the kids and ASADA now conducts approximately 4,200 government-funded tests a year, so many of our younger sportsmen and women will have been tested. However we must also look towards promoting the values of sport that I have just mentioned. Sport is about ethics, health, fun and joy and particularly community and solidarity and participation. Let us encourage excellence, but excellence should come after and as a product of the other qualities, so that doping does not even feature as an option in the minds of our future sportsmen and women. I fear this government has lost its way when it comes to sport. I was looking through the minister’s media releases the other day and I could find only a tiny proportion devoted to junior sport. I see that the parliamentary secretary, the member for Blaxland, is here to deliver the minister’s response. He and I participated in a momentous sporting event when we knocked off the media last year in a cricket game. There were certainly no performance enhancing drugs on that day. There are media releases on the website on support for a world conference on women in sport and proud announcements concerning the appointment of executives. I am sure these are all worthy projects, but the minister is ignoring junior sport. She is sleepwalking through this parliamentary term without getting to grips with or showing a thorough understanding of sport in this country. The government is more concerned about amending immigration laws to allow Russian ice skaters to win gold medals for Australia than it is with MAIN COMMITTEE grassroots sport in suburbs in my electorate like Belmont, Queens Park and Linwood, who are desperately crying out for infrastructure support for their sporting clubs. I will continue to promote grassroots sport in my electorate and I will continue to urge the government to take a similar approach at a national level. I commend the bill to the House. pleased to have the opportunity to sum up debate on the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Amendment Bill 2009. The Rudd government is committed to ensuring that sport continues to be played in a domain which is safe and equitable for all Australian athletes and their support personnel and to ensuring that performance-enhancing drugs are detected, dealt with and deterred at every opportunity. These reforms will enable the Australian Sports AntiDoping Authority to continue to deliver its prescribed functions efficiently and effectively and to be well placed to handle the ever-changing challenges within the fight against drugs into the future. These reforms will provide greater clarity and transparency to the structural and governance arrangements of ASADA and provide an effective framework for the delivery of the Australian government’s antidoping priorities to ensure Australia remains a world leader in the fight against drugs in sport. This bill brings into alignment ASADA’s governance arrangements with those of a traditional model for a Financial Management and Accountability Act, or FMA, agency. ASADA will remain an FMA agency but will cease to be a corporate entity with a separate legal identity from the Commonwealth. In addition, these changes will further deliver on recommendations of the independent review of ASADA which sees ASADA being headed up by a CEO who will be responsible for operational and strategic matters. In line with the recommendations of the independent review, an advisory group will be established to assist the CEO in the development, implementation and delivery of core business matters. The establishment of this advisory group will give the CEO access to individuals with specialist skills and knowledge to assist him or her on matters such as education, testing and investigation. The targeting of members’ skills and knowledge ensures that the advice and support that the advisory group provides are not only of the highest quality but are appropriate. Under the bill, the newly established Anti-Doping Rules Violation Panel will be responsible for making decisions on antidoping rule violations, recommendations about follow-up actions and sanctions. They will also be responsible for maintaining the register of findings. The Anti-Doping Rule Violation Panel will consist of members with specialist knowledge and experience in sports law, ethics, medicine and pharmacology. Australian athletes and support personnel can be confident that the decisions regarding an antidoping rule violation will be at arm’s length not only from the government but also from ASADA, which is responsible for testing, investigation of possible rule violations and prosecution of such violations. The bill also gives effect to a number of other changes to ensure that the ASADA Act maintains consistency with the revision of the World Anti-Doping Code which came into effect on 1 January 2009. With those comments, I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. MAIN COMMITTEE",232,Asada For Enhanced Investigation Of Alleged Doping Violations And The Subsequent Prepara
225,Mr Clare (Blaxland,"Parliamentary Secretary for Employment) (10.25 am)-I amSecond Reading Debate resumed from 17 September, on motion by Ms Roxon: That this bill be now read a second time. ment Bill (No. 2) 2009 will amend the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 to allow the minister to conditionally list prostheses on the Commonwealth prostheses list and to allow for the creation of rules for listing criteria. The Private Health Insurance Act requires private health insurers to pay benefits for prostheses for hospital treatment or hospital substitute treatment that is eligible for a Medicare rebate. Currently more than 9,500 prostheses are listed. Prostheses are listed on the advice of the Prostheses and Devices Committee according to mandatory and non-mandatory criteria. The mandatory criteria include: the prostheses must be registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods; the prostheses must be provided to a person as part of an episode of hospital treatment or hospital substitute treatment; and a Medicare benefit must be payable for the service associated with the prostheses. As stated, there are also non-mandatory criteria. A non-mandatory criterion states that a listed prosthesis should be surgically implanted in the patient and be purposely designed in order to replace an anatomical body part, combat a pathological process or modulate a physiological process. As highlighted in the minister’s second reading speech, the bill will have particular relevance for insulin pumps. Whilst insulin pumps are currently listed, there has been some ambiguity concerning their status due to the fact that they are not surgically implanted and do not require hospital admission. Insulin pumps may not be surgically implanted but they do replicate the function of pancreatic cells, which produce insulin, and accordingly they may be considered a prosthetic. Insulin pumps provide improved glucose stability and assist in reducing the risk of the complications from diabetes, such as retinal eye disease, nerve disease and kidney disease. Type1 diabetes currently affects 140,000 Australian children and adults. All stakeholders would recognise the importance of removing the ambiguity surrounding insulin pumps on the list, and the coalition supports such a move. There have been important initiatives over a number of years now to improve access to appropriate medical services and products for people with diabetes. This is particularly important given Australia has one of the highest incidences of type 1 diabetes, currently the sixth highest incidence globally. The coalition government provided $442 million between 2000-01 and 2005-06 for Diabetes Australia and the National Diabetes Service Scheme. The National Diabetes Service Scheme enables people with diabetes to access subsidies for essential products such as syringes, insulin infusion pump consumables and diagnostic products. The coalition government committed a further $667 million for the period beyond 2006-07. The current minister made reference to other measures being provided for people with diabetes in her second reading speech. Most notably, the minister mentioned the government subsidy for insulin pumps. The subsidy the minister referred to provides $2,500 for people with type 1 diabetes under the age of 18. Access to the subsidy is also means-tested. However, this subsidy has not been delivered as promised. The minister claimed that the subsidy would MAIN COMMITTEE",235,Asada For Enhanced Investigation Of Alleged Doping Violations And The Subsequent Prepara
226,Mr Dutton (Dickson) (10.29 Am),"The Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendbenefit nearly 700 children and young adults in a press release of 2 July 2008. Only families with incomes less than $60,000 are eligible for the full subsidy of $2,500. The government budgeted $1 million for the program in 2008-09; however, in Senate estimates it was stated that only $419,000 had been claimed. As of this month, I am advised that only 38 insulin pumps out of the anticipated 700 have been provided to eligible applicants. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation has been very effective in managing the scheme and communicating with families and health professionals and has successfully generated a high level of interest in the scheme. There have been over 500 enquiries and 164 applications, but uptake has continued to remain very low. With the existing means-testing thresholds, eligible families have been left with too great a co-payment. The co-payment on an average pump costing $7,500 is $5,000 for families earning less than $60,000 per annum. With this bill removing any ambiguity of the status of insulin pumps on the prostheses list, there is a clear incentive for families to take out private health insurance and claim reimbursement after the waiting period if they are in a position to do so, rather than incur the $5,000 co-payment. The coalition supports the provisions of this bill affecting insulin pumps. However, it seems contradictory for the minister to be prosecuting an ideological crusade against private health insurance whilst expecting insurers to cover for the underperformance of government programs, especially when 75 per cent of new pumps are already purchased through private health insurance. With respect to the conditional-listing component of the bill, there is an argument that certain devices which may not otherwise have been listed should be listed for limited interventions which are shown to be clinically appropriate and cost effective. There is a clear benefit to patients to have access to life-saving devices without blowing out costs to private health insurance. How conditional listing is implemented in practice may nevertheless prove problematic without careful consideration. Unfortunately, this bill and the minister’s speech provide very little detail as to the process for conditional listing and the conditions which may be imposed. Without sufficient detail, concerns may arise that ministerial power to impose conditions may be too great and curtail clinical decision making of surgeons. Will conditional listing just be imposed on certain types of surgery or will it extend to where surgery is provided, who provides it or to whom it is provided? As stated, there is a compelling argument for conditional listing, but the government needs to provide greater detail regarding the process of imposing conditions to alleviate such concerns. Similarly, without sufficient detail regarding the conditional listing process there is a risk that interest groups will intensively lobby for prostheses which have failed to meet listing criteria and whose clinical effectiveness and costeffectiveness may be doubtful. The Health Technology Assessment Review is due to report in late 2009. The scope of the review includes ‘listing of prostheses for private health insurance coverage, as currently informed by the Prostheses and Devices Committee’. It would have been more prudent, in my view, for the minister to have waited for the release of the recommendations of this review before progressing with conditional listing. Waiting for its release may have alleviated the aforementioned concerns regarding ministerial power under this bill for the conditional listing process. MAIN COMMITTEE Whilst the coalition do not object to the intentions of this bill, we have concerns about the lack of consultation undertaken, the lack of detail provided in relation to the conditional listing process and the adverse consequences that may result from any rushed implementation. On that basis, we provide support to the bill. We do have a number of concerns, which we hope the government may be able to turn their minds to. In closing, I acknowledge the wonderful work of many people in this parliament, on both sides of the House, in providing their support to the sufferers of type 1 diabetes. In particular, some of the young children who come to Parliament House on a yearly basis are afforded a very warm reception, and rightly so. The involvement of some of my colleagues has been nothing short of outstanding. Mr Deputy Speaker Washer, your involvement in the health area has been quite amazing. It is appropriate that Judi Moylan is in the chamber today. People right across the country have acclaimed the work that she has done for sufferers of diabetes over a very long period. The passion that she brings to the debate has resulted in better outcomes for sufferers of diabetes, in particular type 1. Long may she continue to do that work for the betterment of sufferers in this country. Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2009. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 to allow for conditional listing of prostheses in the Private Health Insurance (Prostheses) Rules and to allow the Minister for Health and Ageing to make rules specifying criteria for listing prostheses in those rules. Under the Private Health Insurance Act 2007, private health insurers are required to pay benefits for a range of prostheses that are provided as part of an episode of hospital treatment or hospital substitute treatment for which a patient has cover and for which a Medicare benefit is payable for the associated professional service. The types of products on the prostheses list include cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators, cardiac stents, hip and knee replacements and intraocular lenses, as well as human tissues such as human heart valves, corneas, bones-part and whole-and muscle tissue. Under the current provisions of the Private Health Insurance Act 2007, the act, there is some ambiguity as to whether a device can be conditionally listed where a Medicare benefit is payable for the professional service associated with the provision of the device. Conditional listing will require private health insurance benefits to be paid for recipients of the device where the conditions set out in the rules are satisfied. With further developments in medical technology, it is expected that there will be a greater need for listing prostheses on a conditional basis in the future. Conditional listing of prostheses in the prostheses rules will require private health insurance benefits to be paid in relation to a high-cost life-saving device to patients who are waiting for a heart transplant. It is expected that patients will be able to maintain a high quality of life with this device, which would be prohibitively costly without private health insurance benefits. Specifying criteria in the prostheses rules that must be satisfied in order for a prosthesis to be listed in those rules will enable listing of, for example, prostheses that are useful and costeffective, such as insulin pumps, which will provide benefits to many privately insured families contending with diabetes. Mr Deputy Speaker Washer, we know from all the reports that are coming out, and as you are well aware, diabetes is becoming a major national and internaMAIN COMMITTEE",236,Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2009
227,Mr Bidgood (Dawson) (10.38 Am),"I rise to speak on the Private Health Insurancetional issue. It is very much a lifestyle disease. Through the technologies of our age and through the provision of different types of food, the way those foods are made and preserved, we are seeing a steep rise in diabetes across the nation, and it is something that we do need to try to prevent. Once people have diabetes, particularly type 1, it is really disabling of their whole lives and lifestyle. It is a gross inconvenience to them and anything that we can do to make those people’s lives more contented and satisfied will be of benefit. The means and measures in the changes to these rules and the enablement of private health insurance to help meet the cost of some of these insulin pumps will be greatly beneficial to the lives of people suffering from type 1 diabetes and also the lives of type 2 sufferers who may need some help. As stated by the minister, products will only be listed where they are clinically effective, cost-effective, provide significant health benefits to patients and can prevent the need for expensive downstream medical costs. The whole decision-making process has been based on clear evidence that it is clinically effective and that it is the best means of dealing with a diabetic situation or any other situation whether it concerns the heart or any of the other organs that I have mentioned, particularly with human heart valves and things like that. It has to be clinically effective, cost-effective, proven and provide significant, not just slight, health benefits to the patient. At the end of the day the laws and the rules which we are putting down here are all about benefiting the patient and looking after the patient for their whole life-in the community, in the family and at work. If we can help people have a more wholesome, effective life then we have done a good thing. I believe that this legislation before the chamber right now is a good thing and that is why we are backing it wholeheartedly. The new criteria will not override any of the current legislative criteria for listing-that is very important. What it is doing is helping with medical cost. These changes will deliver significant benefits to consumers who are privately insured and seeking to use these and other devices. Once again, I go back to the fact that as we get older so many things come along which we just do not expect will happen to us. I have just turned 50 and I am beginning to discover a few health issues myself which I never thought would occur to me. God forbid that I should have to action some of the things that need to be done in some people’s lives; there but for the grace of God go we. Good government, good laws and good rules are about thinking about other people, not just ourselves. Even though things that I have mentioned here may not be happening to me personally, or to any of us personally, they are happening to people across the nation. While they may not be occurring in massive numbers, nevertheless, they are affecting people’s lives and their quality of life. People’s health is important and legislation like this goes to that. If we can prove clearly that we have things that are clinically medically effective and that are the most cost-effective and there is clear evidence that they improve a patient’s quality of life then I think we are doing a good thing. The Private Health Insurance Act 2007, which this bill amends, and the recommendations that are before us are good. It is a good act, it is a good amendment and it makes good provision for the Prostheses List. I can not say more plainly or more clearly how wholeheartedly I back this bill and commend it to the House. think some of my comments bear repeating as there are some very important issues for this debate. The Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2009 provides that MAIN COMMITTEE",238,Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2009
228,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (10.46 Am),"I spoke in this place recently about this matter but Iopportunity. Back in 2005 the Commonwealth government made a series of improvements to the Prostheses List arrangements so that insured patients had access to a range of clinically effective and appropriate prostheses at a reasonable cost. For us in this place one of the great challenges is how we can deliver best-practice medicine to people and at the same time make sure that the systems we put in place are cost-effective and make the best use of the available money in the health portfolio. Those tensions are not easy to manage. The Review of the Prostheses Listing Arrangements, which was chaired by Mr Robert Doyle, stated that the fundamental logic of the new arrangements was that prostheses should be listed if they were clinically effective; that items of equivalent clinical effectiveness should receive the same benefit, and that incremental benefits should be available for incremental improvements in clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness; that there must be a prosthesis available for every Medicare Benefits Schedule item, provided at no additional cost to the patient; and that sponsors wishing to charge more than the assessed cost-effective benefit could do so and the patient would then pay the gap. The arrangements were constructed so that independent clinical advice was central in determining questions of clinical effectiveness. We know that any debate about anything, particularly to do with medicine or science, is fraught with difficulty for ministers and for those of us in this place trying to pick our way through some of these complex bills, because there are a variety of viewpoints. You just have to read some of the literature on this subject to see the different opinions about the clinical effectiveness of some devices. The minister will have power to conditionally list prostheses. It has been argued that this power could be used as a tool to impose limitations on the clinician’s ability to choose the most appropriate listed prosthesis. Others have argued that without sufficient detail and safeguards governments will be relentlessly lobbied to include items on the list item which may not be cost effective. So we can immediately begin to grasp the complexities of administering such a program. On9 September 2009, Amy Corderoy wrote an article in which she said: Identifying which Type1 diabetes patients will benefit from public hospital-funded insulin pumps may be difficult, according to a clinical audit undertaken in Western Australia. “Patient selection [for insulin pump use] is important, as insulin pumps are cost-effective only if they reduce levels of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and the frequency of hypoglycaemia – although quality of life may also be an important benefit,” Dr Ken Thong and colleagues from Fremantle Hospital and the University of Western Australia wrote in the MJA. The endocrinologists identified over 100 patients who had received both public hospital-funded insulin pumps and privately health insurance-funded pumps (32 public and 77 private) over an eight year period. The public patients had had more hospital admissions than the private patients both before and after the commencement of insulin pump therapy (0.7 vs 0.3 admissions per year p=0.02). After commencing pump therapy, HbA1c levels fell significantly in the private patients (8.7% vs 8.0% p<0.005) but not in the public patients (9.2% vs 8.9% p=0.17). There was also no significant difference in diabetes-related admissions before and after commencement of pump therapy in either group. “We need to think very carefully about which patients we should be offering pump therapy to,” coauthor Professor Bu Yeap told Endocrinology Update. MAIN COMMITTEE However, he added that the study was too small to conclude that it was not cost-effective to treat patients with publically-funded insulin pumps. “The public patients tended to have more difficult to control diabetes in the first place and that may be why we didn’t see a similar improvement in HbA1c,” he said. “It’s a glass half empty half full kind of thing. It’s very pleasing that in the [private] group we did see a reduction in HbA1c… but it has made us think much more carefully about whether we should set up more formal criteria for pump usage”. I draw that to the attention of the House firstly to illustrate the complexity of the differing views and some of the studies that have been done on this but also because I wanted to focus on insulin pumps in particular in my remarks on this bill, which basically stipulates that private health insurers must pay benefits for prostheses that are provided as part of an episode of hospital treatment or hospital substitute treatment and for which a Medicare benefit is payable for the associated professional service. The Commonwealth prosthesis list contains all those products that fit the above mandatory criteria. The Minister for Health and Ageing determines what products are on the list, having regard to the mandatory criteria and also non-mandatory criteria. Currently, a product is either listed or it is not. This legislation will establish a conditional listing category on the list for products that are not appropriate for general use but are clinically effective in specific circumstances. In the second reading speech, the minister for health specifically pointed to insulin infusion pumps as an example of a product that should be conditionally listed. In that speech the minister said: The amendments proposed in the bill would enable the device to be listed on a conditional basis, ensuring patients have access to life-saving treatments in a way that controls the additional costs to private health insurance. All private health insurers make payments towards insulin pumps, as they are on the prosthesis list; however, there has always been some uncertainty about their long-term status on the prosthesis list because they are not surgically implanted, do not require hospital admission for initialisation and are not associated with a Medicare Benefits Schedule item. This uncertainty was recognised in the government’s review from which I just quoted. The review noted: Under current arrangements insurers are not required to pay benefits for products provided in these circumstances, even though the items are included on the List. Therefore, this legislation is aimed at resolving the uncertainty by creating a new sublist for devices such as insulin pumps that do not meet the mandatory criteria but should still be on the list in certain circumstances. Where an individual has access to private health insurance, they are not then eligible to receive the means tested insulin pump subsidy, and this is one of the matters I would like to raise in addressing the issues around this bill. There are other challenges, as well, in relation to insulin pumps. The devices are constantly being improved, there is new technology, and there are already other challenges facing us with new insulin pumps incorporating continuous glucose monitoring devices. The cost of the transmitter components of these devices is reimbursed through ancillary health insurance by only some private health insurers. The sensor components are not covered, nor are they eligible for any government subsidy. The insulin pump program has also not been as effective as we would have liked it to have been. I am MAIN COMMITTEE pleased to see that the Minister for Health and Ageing is currently reviewing that program; that is welcome. I raise these issues around insulin pumps because, as I have said in this place before, back in 2000 we started the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group. I would like to acknowledge the participation and incredible work of the member for Moore, who is currently in the chair today. He has been a tower of strength in that group and has been able to help draw greater attention to the issue of diabetes within the community. Many of my other colleagues have joined us in that group as well. There are Senator Guy Barnett, who is part of the executive, and my colleagues the member for Lyons and the member for Isaacs. All of the members who agreed to join that group participate in the many activities that from time to time take place. I suppose that one of the most successful and moving of those activities co-sponsored by the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation was the Kids in the House program, where 100 children from all over Australia were flown to Parliament House with their carers to talk about what it is like to be a kid with type 1, insulin dependent, diabetes. Their stories, quite frankly, were heart wrenching. I think I have rarely, if ever, attended a function in this place where I have seen some of my colleagues actually openly weeping. They were very moving stories indeed. Juvenile diabetes really does rob young people of many opportunities, and that is what these young people talked about: the limitations that were placed on their lives, often from soon after they were born and diagnosed with insulin dependent, or juvenile, diabetes. These children also have a lifetime of high-level care to manage this disease. Every day, they have to pay attention to their insulin levels: to monitor them, to have multiple finger pricks to test the levels of insulin in their system and then, of course, to administer a dose of insulin where that insulin level falls too low. If their insulin levels fall too low, these young people can fall into a coma. I will talk more about that in just a moment, but it does have a dramatic impact. These young children who came to Parliament House on two occasionsand I think there is soon to be a third-had an opportunity to go around this parliament and talk one-on-one with their member of parliament and the senators for their state and to express to them the difficulties and the challenges they confront as insulin dependent diabetics and to plead with this parliament to consider directing funding to research. to find a cure for juvenile diabetes. The theme of the young people was ‘promise to remember me’. I do not think that anyone who spoke to the young people visiting here was not profoundly touched by that experience. Type1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, which is something people sometimes get mixed up about. Young children have said to me, ‘We’ve often been teased at school that we’ve got diabetes because we eat the wrong things and we’re overweight, or we’re overweight because we don’t look after our health,’ so there is a lot of confusion in the community. Type1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease affecting some 140,000 Australian children and adults. There are a lot of children affected by this, and we have to be concerned that we have one of the highest incidences of type 1 diabetes globally-in fact we are sixth in the world-and that rate is continuing to increase in Australia by three per cent per annum. Ninety-five per cent of diabetes in children is type 1 diabetes. Type1 sufferers experience more than 40 dangerous hypoglycaemic-that is, low blood sugar-episodes a year. As one mother said, ‘My biggest worry when I go into my son’s bedroom every morning is whether I MAIN COMMITTEE can wake him up.’ The origin of setting up the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group was a visit to my office by a couple and their very young boy in his early year of primary school who had type 1 diabetes and was experiencing great difficulty. His medical practitioners were experiencing great difficulty even in levelling out his insulin levels. His parents would have to wake him up several times during the night, test his insulin levels and administer medication as required. This was interfering with this young boy’s ability to do his schoolwork. Being woken two or three times during the night for testing and then medicating, he would go to school the next morning feeling pretty lousy, so his schoolwork was not going well. This family, who were not wealthy people at all, scraped up the money to get him onto an insulin pump, which made a huge difference to their peace of mind and to his lifestyle. This young man went on to be dux of his school, and the family generally come to me once a year around Christmas time and he gives me an update. The difference has been really remarkable. WhatI want to do in this debate today is stress the importance of not just stating-as governments have done successively, which is good-that diabetes is a national health priority but then matching that rhetoric with the best possible medication and the best possible access to devices that will give children in particular a good quality of life and perhaps increase their lifespan. Young people with juvenile diabetes on average live fewer years than the rest of us do, even with the best of care, and they face a lifetime of really quite horrendous health complications. So we need to recognise that there are major lifestyle and quality-of-life issues around access to the best possible medicine and the best possible devices. When it comes to children, we should be generous in making sure that they have the best possible access. Every hypoglycaemic episode causes physical and psychological harm. Hypoglycaemic episodes affect cognitive function and memory as well. These pumps are not for everyone, but for many young people they can be a very important part of the management regime. Twelve to 15 years after the onset of diabetes, devastating complications can set in, and I have mentioned those many times in this place. Diabetes is the leading cause of adult blindness, heart attack, stroke and lower limb amputation and is the most common cause of kidney failure, at 40 per cent. Fifty per cent of people with diabetes die of cardiovascular disease. So there are myriad complications around this disease, and it is particularly tough for children and their families knowing that they have to face such life-threatening illnesses along the way. I also pay tribute to the work of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation because it was with them that we pushed to get the consumables that go with the pumps. These are things that have to be changed every couple of days. They are the devices that allow the pumps to do their work. In addition to the $7,000 or $8,000 that the pumps cost, the parents of the young boy that I saw came to me and said: ‘We’re paying out $2,600 a year for these devices. Can you get them listed on the NDSS?’ That is why we started our group. We went to work and convinced the then Howard government to list these devices on the NDSS and assist parents. Some families have several children with diabetes, so it can become a huge imposition. The insulin pumps are used to closely mimic the insulin delivery of a healthy pancreas for more predictable and tighter blood glucose control, and that is why these are so important. So, whatever we are doing in legislation-and with this legislation in particular-we need to be very mindful that we do not deny people the opportunity for improved long-term health outcomes by them not being able to access insulin pump therapy. I ask the minister to closely examine this legislation to iron out any of the glitches and also to look at the subsidy program MAIN COMMITTEE that currently is not working as successfully as it should. I look forward to the outcome of that review and making sure that more low-income families can access insulin pump therapies for their children. Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2009 and, like the previous speaker, I want to focus on diabetes, but I will go through the conditional listing issues first. This is a good piece of legislation because it allows the minister to engage in conditional listing. It really means that in those circumstances where a prosthesis is necessary on the basis of clinical circumstances a listing can be given. There has been some commentary about ministerial discretion here and whether or not this is the right thing to do, but in the circumstances I think it is clear that we need to make these changes. There are a variety of different prostheses. I see a few doctors in the chamber at the moment. As a humble lawyer, I do not propose to make any comments about the various natures of prostheses except that they are many and varied and that medical technology has advanced enormously in our lifetimes. We can barely imagine the kinds of changes that are going to happen in the next century. But the legislation does require private health insurance operators to pay benefits for prostheses which are part of an episode of hospital-substitute treatment and for which a Medicare benefit is payable for the associated professional service. It is the case that prostheses enhance the lives of so many people. All of us in this place would know constituents, friends and relatives who have been saved by knee replacements, hip replacements, pacemakers-various kinds of prostheses which have not only saved the lives of individuals but also enhanced their quality of life. They enabled these people to enjoy and have an abundant life which they could not otherwise enjoy, and I can think of numerous friends of mine whose lives were full of sport and recreation who by virtue of age, illness and injury have suffered the travails of being immobile, and who have now received hip replacements and knee replacements and have enjoyed a quality of life which they could barely imagine during their times of disability. So what we are doing in this legislation is important. It is unclear, as the minister said in her second reading speech, whether a prosthesis can be conditionally listed in circumstances where a Medicare benefit is payable. I had a look at what the minister had to say, at the Bills Digest and at the other commentary on this matter, and it seems very clear that a surgically implanted device can be listed for general use or simply not listed at all. The conditional listing will enable the device to be listed in some circumstances. Where a patient can get access to life-saving treatments and other quality of life assistance, this will enable the person to live a productive, healthy life. That is a fair and decent thing to do in our society. It is important that we enable all our citizens to be part of community life and to enjoy the kinds of activities which they would have enjoyed previously. We believe in social inclusion. Providing assistance by way of prostheses makes a real difference in our community life. There are many people who can participate in RSL groups, in church life, in sporting clubs as coaches and in other activities which they otherwise would not have been able to do. I am happy to speak in support of this legislation because I have seen the benefit of prostheses amongst my friends, relatives and constituents. I have seen what it can do for their lives. MAIN COMMITTEE",239,Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2009
229,Mr Neumann (Blair) (11.06 Am),"I speak in support of the Private Health InsuranceThe second aspect of this legislation deals with the issue of insulin pumps and ensuring that the Australian community can get access to those pumps. This will make a difference to people’s lives, particularly those of children suffering from type 1 diabetes. All of us see constituents in our offices on a weekly basis, but one of the things that really struck me the most was the meeting I had with a fellow in his thirties, married with a young son who, the next year, was intending to go to a local primary school in my home city of Ipswich. The parents came with their little boy and showed him to me and talked to me about him. They were extremely worried about how he would cope with primary school in 2008-the meeting took place just after I was elected in November 2007. I remember that meeting vividly because the mother had tears in her eyes and the father had a pained and anguished look. They had, because of their circumstances, had to borrow money from a relative to pay for an insulin pump. Even then, they were concerned about how their son would be able to manage it when he commenced year 1 the next year. It brought home to me the stark reality of the difficulties faced by parents who cannot afford a pump. It also brought home to me, who has been blessed with having two children who do not suffer from diabetes, the difficulties parents have to sufferthe anguish, anxiety and sheer agitation of thinking that their son or daughter might die at any moment of the day. I was pleased that the Rudd government undertook to provide a subsidy of up to $2,500 for insulin pumps for people with type 1 diabetes. I took the opportunity, after that meeting, to have a look at the impact of type 1 diabetes, and diabetes generally, on my local community. This legislation will enable a new part of the Prostheses List to include those devices which are not surgically implanted so that people with type 1 diabetes will be able to get access to insulin pumps, which are integral to their lives, in the circumstances. I have had a look at what diabetes was doing to my community and I have had a look at what the Australian Diabetes Map said about my electorate of Blair in South-east Queensland. I also noted that the International Diabetes Federation asserts that, by the year 2010, 285 million people will live with diabetes worldwide. The 2006 census says that, in my electorate of Blair, which is about 70 per cent of the city of Ipswich, the Lockyer Valley and the Fassifern Valley to the west and south-west, some 5,743 people have been diagnosed with diabetes. Local doctors tell me that there are likely to be vastly more people who are undiagnosed. On just about every statistic, whether it is on gestation or type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes, my electorate is almost always above the national average. For example, according to the 2006 census, there are 4,773 people suffering from type 2 diabetes in my electorate. The percentage of the group suffering from diabetes is 82.85 per cent but in my electorate it is 83.11 per cent. The number requiring insulin, which is a more pertinent statistic, is about 1,967 of that group of people who are suffering from diabetes. The national average is 32.15 per cent, but in my electorate of Blair it is 34.25 per cent. According to the census, there were 47 people using insulin pumps at that stage. Again, we are above the national average with 0.82 per cent whereas the national average is 0.71 per cent. In my community there are 327 veterans with DVA, which is 5.69 per cent as opposed to 3.95 per cent nationally. Also, we have a large Aboriginal community in my electorate, and again, this is above the national average in that regard. MAIN COMMITTEE My electorate is more affected by diabetes than most others across the country so the legislation before the House is important. The fact that government is contributing large sums of money to the National Diabetes Services Scheme-according to the minister, it is in excess of $126 million-is important for my electorate. It is important that we enable families, like the family with the young fellow who came to see me after I was elected, to get access to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for things like insulin. We do expend more than $300 million on those types of medicine through that scheme. People without private health insurance suffer greatly because they cannot get access to the assistance they require and have to rely on family and friends or their own resources. It is one of the reasons I support the private health insurance schemes in this country. I think it is important that we do it. The conversations that I had with that family, and with other constituencies who have subsequently spoken to me, is what the member for Pearce had to say: the anxiety and the worry of going into their son and daughter’s bedroom in the morning and finding they do not wake up as they have had an ‘episode’. This is how they euphemistically described it to me. As a result, their beloved child is no longer with them. Health complications from diabetes impacts not only those young people, but also those people who suffer type 2 diabetes. On8 OctoberI held a health forum in my electorate at the University of Queensland Ipswich campus. I want to commend Professor Helen Chenery from the Faculty of Health Sciences for her assistance and the University of Queensland Ipswich campus for their help. The University of Queensland Ipswich campus is undertaking an Ipswich study which is a long term study into the health needs of a community in the Ipswich and West Moreton area. Professor Robert Bush is involved in that study. It is the site of the GP Superclinic, a $2.5 million commitment by the Rudd Labor government. The focus of the GP Superclinic will be not only chronic heart disease but also type 2 diabetes and assistance to parents of young children suffering from type 1 diabetes, which are so prevalent in my electorate. This topic came up at the health forum because preventative health is so crucial with respect to type 2 diabetes. I urge the government to consider the Ipswich and West Moreton area being designated as a regional health innovation site. Diabetes is just another reason that the government should think about that, and I urge the government to spend far more than simply two per cent of our total expenditure on health and hospitals on preventative health. That is why I am incredulous about the fact that the coalition can simply oppose the reforms that are currently up in the Senate. I find it amazing, because there are decent and good people sitting opposite as there are on our side. I cannot believe they cannot see that this is a very important health innovation measure to improve the wellness of our community. The legislation before this chamber is important. It is important because it will affect the lives of parents and young people suffering from type 1 diabetes, but it will also allow the minister to take a more clinical approach based on medical advice and make sure that prostheses are more available to and more cost-effective for our community. It will allow parents and patients to listen to the real needs of their bodies and their children’s bodies. This is important legislation. For this reason and for the health of my community I support this particular bill. Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2009. As it has indicated, the opposition is not opposed to this bill. We see some virtue in it but, as with many things that the Rudd government does, the virtue in the bill is not matched by dexterity in its execution. MAIN COMMITTEE",244,Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2009
230,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (11.22 Am),"I rise to add some comments to the debate on theThat is one of the areas I would like to touch on today. Essentially, the bill will amend the Private Health Insurance Act to allow the minister to list a prosthesis on a conditional basis that specifies the purpose for which it can be utilised and, once it has passed a number of new tests aimed to ensure that it is of a life-saving characteristic, that the prosthesis has cost and clinical efficacy-all perfectly reasonable factors-and that it has been assessed as fit for the purpose for which it is intended to be implanted in the body. This is achieved by adding a new listing beyond the current listing arrangements which provides for the general use listing of prostheses. Broad, unconstrained use of prostheses has in some cases seen prostheses not listed because of the specificity of their intended use, and the only scope available for the current listing is on a general use basis. That of itself seems a reasonable thing to do with new technology bringing new devices, with the progress of health and medical innovation seeing new opportunities for prostheses to improve the standard of living of people to carry forward and nurture their health and wellness. We need to accommodate the new technologies where they can be listed for a particular purpose. As I said, at the moment there is only a general listing provision. This amendment seeks to offer a conditional listing facility to accompany the private health insurance industry’s funding of those particular devices. The thing that is quite strange is that, whilst that is all positive, you would have thought some internal consultation would have been worthwhile. It is ironic and, frankly, quite worrying that we have this bill before the House to give that new power to the minister. The power is a coathanger power. It does not specify precisely what devices it applies to and how it will be used. There is a whole lot of subordinate legislation in the form of regulations that will give effect to those listings, so that is all still to come. What is strange, though, is the imposition of limitations on the clinical use of prostheses. That is something that I would imagine many in the medical profession would be wary of. They would be concerned about the government mandating particular applications of technologies where they, in good conscience and driven by the patients’ best interests, might see another opportunity for the application of that technology for lifesaving health and wellness improvement. We do not know how that will work because these are very early days. We are assured that there will be sufficient safeguards, that the clinicians will continue to be very patient centred in their approach and that where they see an opportunity for improved health outcomes which involves a prosthesis there will be some machinery there to make that case. We hope those safeguards, though, will not see a relentless process of clinicians lobbying the government to recognise the application which they, in good conscience and considered clinical judgment, think is in the interests of the patient but is not covered by the conditional listing as it stands. They will have to say to the patient, ‘Just wait for a sec. The technology may have been designed for the purpose for which I am recommending it be used. This prosthesis is available. It is something that will have very positive and cost-effective clinical outcomes that will advantage your wellness and health. We can argue that it is cost-effective but it has not got the tick yet from the Commonwealth to allow it to be covered by your health insurer.’ We hope there will not be another group of lobbyists beating a path to Canberra. The place is jam-packed with lobbyists at the moment. It seems nothing can happen in this country unless you have sucked up to and spent a lot of time bonding with the government. Private MAIN COMMITTEE enterprise seems to be dwindling, as businesses now need to get the Rudd government imprimatur for everything that goes on in this country. That is why the biggest growth industry in Australia at the moment is lobbyists, coming to see whether some of the taxpayer largesse that is being doled out in abundant volumes can come their way. Clinicians will have to make sure, as they come to lobby to get a prosthesis conditionally listed, that they can at least get a flight on a plane, to have the chance to get up here. They might need to arm wrestle and bump off some other people, as they all want to come to Canberra because all knowledge is here, apparently. It is quite amazing that, with that abundant knowledge and perpetual wisdom that we have now in Canberra under Prime Minister Rudd and his team, they have not quite managed to join up some dots. We see this in so many areas of government policy. You, Deputy Speaker Washer, were instrumental in releasing yesterday the report of a parliamentary inquiry into the impact of rising sea levels on the coastal zone. It is a very interesting report. I have enjoyed reading it and I commend you for a number of the measures in it. But it did make the point that we have not quite managed to join up government decision making. It is still very bitsy. It is even bitsier in the health portfolio. The diligent professionals in the health portfolio seem to have missed that there is a health technology assessment review going on and it is due to report later this year. You would have thought that the machinery that is being enabled by this legislation would have taken account of that review. The scope of the review includes: … listing of prostheses for private health insurance coverage, as currently informed by the PDCthat is, the Prostheses and Devices Committee. I would have thought that the work going on in that review would have informed this bill, but the bill is pushing on without having the benefit of that review’s findings. I hope some synchronicity can be achieved at some point down the track. You would have thought it would be sensible and wise to wait for the release of the review’s recommendations before acting on something that the review is designed to address. But this is the way things happen now at the ‘Kremlin’ here in Canberra, where so much is going on. That disconnection is worrying. That is not a reason for the opposition not to support the bill. It just highlights the abundant lack of consultation, the lack of detail and the lack of connected, coordinated decision making that seems to be very much a character of this Rudd Labor government here in Canberra. On that machinery, we will have conditional listing capability that will not remove the general listing provision that is there now but add a new listing capability. That should be a good thing, but, as I mentioned earlier, how clinicians will interact with it is another matter. As a former Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, I was highly exposed to some of the issues that the previous speaker spoke of. I regularly was approached and informed about insights clinicians could bring to the care, treatment and wellness of the veterans community, which in some cases involved the innovative use of clinical technologies and practices that had been developed and carried forward. We were very keen to accommodate that, as we aimed to give world-class health care and support to our veterans community. Here is an example where some of that innovation might run into a little bit of a roadblock with the listing process. However, the good thing is that conditional listing presents more opportunities than general use listing, which might not have seen some of these new technologies embraced in the first place. MAIN COMMITTEE The second part of this is the listing of the insulin pumps. I am pleased that this has again come to the government’s attention. It is quite fascinating that the government announced its own scheme after initially resisting the opposition’s case, and the opposition’s election commitment, to introduce a taxpayer subsidy for insulin pumps for people coping with the challenge-and in some cases the despair-of type 1 diabetes. We had to drag the Rudd Labor government kicking and screaming to actually pick up that national campaign, which I am pleased to say was launched by the then Leader of the Opposition, Brendan Nelson, in my electorate back in April 2008. It was a great campaign launch. The then shadow health minister, Joe Hockey, was there, along with Richard Colbeck, the senator from Tasmania who was then opposition parliamentary secretary for health. It was a really good launch and a key outcome of the listening tour that Dr Nelson had undertaken. We had made an election commitment, one that the Rudd Labor government had not matched. We then had to go and make the case again in the lead-up to the 2008-09 budget to try and highlight to the Rudd Labor government not just the moral case for giving people with type 1 diabetes optimum opportunities to live full, rich and enjoyable lives but also the health case and the cost-effectiveness of supporting the deployment of the latest insulin pump technology. Thankfully that message was heard by the Rudd Labor government, and I for one was encouraged to hear welcoming noises in the 2008-09 budget about a subsidy program for insulin pumps. What has been most disturbing has been the fact-and I am sure the Australian public must be waking up to this-that the publicity, the headlines, the stunts and the media spin are just like a warm-up act. What actually happens afterwards looks very different in many cases. Sadly, in the case of this insulin pump subsidy, that is exactly what has happened. We were reassured, on the back of the opposition campaign for 5,000 children, particularly, to benefit from government subsidies, that the Rudd Labor government would pick up that measure. What has happened, though, is that the implementation has fallen so far short of the promise, the hype and the headline hunting of the announcement in the first place. That is not only a political travesty; think of the implications for the people involved. On the listening tour and at the launch that happened in a hospital in my electorate, we met parents and children who were so supportive of what the Liberal and National parties were trying to do, so encouraging of us taking the pressure up to the Rudd Labor government and bringing the case to Canberra to demonstrate the cost benefits as well as the lifestyle advantages of insulin pumps, particularly for children. There were examples that moved us. I remember a wonderful woman from Dingley who had two children that were type 1 diabetic and insulin-dependent. She was describing to me the emotional and financial obstacles that she had to face and the demands on her parenting. Her children were some of the most stoic and spunky little humans I have seen. They had so much go to them, even though every day started with an injection, every day they had to monitor their condition and every day their blood sugar levels were uppermost in their minds, even when they were trying to work out what Dora was talking about in Spanish on the latest episode of Dora the Explorer. Such gripping things that would occupy most kids’ minds were secondary; these young kids had to keep themselves healthy. She broke down while describing to me how much it was going to cost and what a difference these insulin pumps would make to her children’s lives and how there was no way on earth by which she could possibly MAIN COMMITTEE afford to buy one. She was totemic of why we mounted this campaign-so totemic that noone could come away other than completely convinced that this was the right way forward. So we have had the announcement that the government would provide these subsidies, but the subsidies have not been delivered up to what was promised. The Minister for Health and Ageing claimed the subsidies would benefit some 700 children and young adults. That was in Minister Roxon’s media release back in July 2008. The government had a budget estimate-it was about $1 million-and yet less than half of that has been claimed. Only 38 insulin pumps out of an anticipated 700 have been provided to eligible participants. That is from evidence tendered at a Senate estimates committee. How do we explain this to that mother from Dingley? How do we explain the eligibility criteria that see the subsidy so out of reach for people, even for those on regular incomes; that they cannot access it. She must be wondering, ‘Such promise; such hope.’ It is a campaign that was led by the Liberal and National parties and is one we continue with in opposition, making the case. Then we get the announcement from the minister and, typical of the Rudd Labor government, it is all announcement and no follow-through. And we have this appalling situation. An opposition member-All froth; no beer! benefiting from a program that for them was just such an enormous program of hope given that the government was going to assist them and those kids, who had such spunk, would have had support from the government. enough to learn as well as they can at school was their first hope. They recognised that what the opposition was advocating would deliver that. They then heard the echo from the Labor Party sometime afterwards and then found, sadly, from these figures provided to the Senate estimates committee that it was a hollow echo. It in no way matched the leadership that the Liberal and National parties were offering. What has happened now is-in a belated recognition that private health matters, that the public system has pressures and demands and plays a crucial role-we are now turning back to the private sector. We are now saying to the private sector through private health insurance, ‘Will you provide these devices? We will list these devices. Yes, we have just planned to introduce rules that prostheses need to be medically implanted, but an insulin pump is not medically implanted, therefore-gee-we had better put another listing together.’ Thankfully that listing will at least see the private health community fill this void-this void between expectation and political spin and delivery-that the Rudd Labor government has created. So here today we are debating a bill to allow the private health insurance sector to do what the Rudd Labor government promised it would do and has not. There are so many points you could make out of that. The totemic example of how this Rudd Labor government-this federal Labor party-governs for the country is captured through this. The example of people who promise so much and deliver so little is captured through this. There has probably been more money spent promoting the program than has been delivered-more effort gone into the press release than in the execution of the support for families that desperately need it. And MAIN COMMITTEE",246,Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2009

232,Mr Laming,Will they get a laptop at school?,250,Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2009
233,Mr Billson,"Who knows whether they will get a laptop at school. Just being wellthen, at the end of the day, all is well and there is only wisdom in Canberra! That seems to be the prevailing attitude of the current government. Now there is a recognition that the private sector has a role to play-belatedly-and the private sector will have to mop up this underperformance of the Rudd Labor government. In my own community of Dunkley, there are about 878 people living with type 1 diabetes. The number registered with type 1 diabetes across Australia at 30 September 2006 was 122,000 plus. This has an enormous impact on young people. The rate at which type 1 diabetes is emerging in our younger population is very concerning, and the community that I represent has not been excluded from it. It has been the focus of local media coverage as those statistics about condition prevalence have come to attention. Diabetes Australia have done a remarkable job of highlighting how important this is to the local community. The Liberal and National parties understood that, acted, provided leadership, made an election commitment and carried that through after the election. The Liberal and National parties understood what was going on and educated the Rudd Labor government. The Rudd Labor government picked up the topic and made the statements but has not delivered. So this-a belated recognition that the private health insurance industry matters in our private-public community health model in Australia-is something that we should welcome. It again makes you wonder why the Rudd Labor government is undermining private health with its changes in the subsidy for private health insurance incentives, why it is again looking to private health to perform where the Rudd Labor government could not but at the same time making it harder for the private health industry to do more, as incentives and encouragement are wound back by Canberra. It is just another example where health policy seems to be very disconnected. I highlighted that there is concurrently a review about this very subject while we are debating the topic in the House. Here is an example of private health being asked to do more when it is actually being made less attractive for people and the private health industry is being put under pressure by this government. The Labor government is saying: ‘Do more, private health industry. We’re going to make it harder for you, but we’re going to expect you to do more.’ That is what this bill is about. It is like the medicentre in my electorate, where the 12,000 to 14,000 category 4 and 5 attendees at the accident and emergency department at the Frankston Hospital have an option. They can go to a medicentre, an after-hours GP clinic. The Rudd Labor government is going to halve the funding for that program, a program that has been going for decades with the collaboration and support of GPs, who have been able to stay in their practices knowing they do not have to get up, possibly every night, in the middle of the night to attend to their patients because there is a collaborative after-hours service available. It has kept GPs in the practice of being doctors. It has supported the health services in our area. And now, for all of that good work, it is going to have its funding halved. All that will do, potentially, is send a large chunk of those 12,000 to 14,000 category 4 and 5 patients back into the emergency department-the emergency department that is under such pressure. Rather than increase the resources, the state Labor government has increased the size of the waiting room. What is going on here? The collaboration that is needed in health policy is missing. It is evident in this, and we see it in so many areas. We are not opposing the bill, but there is a lot of work to be done to make it work. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE members of the parliament recognise the passionate advocacy of the former member for Bradfield, the former Leader of the Opposition, in this area and a range of other areas in the health sector, but it is rather graceless of the member for Dunkley not to confess to the sin of omission of the previous government in doing nothing in the area of insulin pumps for 11½ years. The member for Dunkley might also like to explain to his constituents who need insulin pumps his view that we should not proceed with the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2009 pending the health technology assessment, when, if you read the bill, you know that, when passed, it will facilitate the uptake of insulin pumps. Leaving aside the internal inconsistencies and very selective reading of history by the member for Dunkley, I thank members for their contribution to the debate on this bill and particularly note that the government has noted the contribution of the shadow minister to the debate on this bill. The Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2009 will amend the Private Health Insurance Act 2007. The bill provides for amendments to the act to allow for conditional listing of prostheses on the Commonwealth Prostheses List and to allow the Minister for Health and Ageing to make rules to specify criteria for listing prostheses on the list. Under the act, it is currently unclear whether a prosthesis can be conditionally listed where the prosthesis is provided in circumstances where a Medicare benefit is payable. The bill will allow for the rules to set out criteria that must be satisfied for an application for listing on the Prostheses List to be granted, including different listing criteria for different circumstances. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES No. 5) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 September, on motion by Mr Shorten: That this bill be now read a second time. ment (2009 Measures No. 5) Bill 2009. This bill has a number of important schedules and was introduced on 16 September. Some of the schedules and matters dealt with are technical and some are quite straightforward. I say at the outset that the coalition will be supporting the passage of this bill through both houses. I will run very briefly through some of the schedules. The first deals with GST law and simply seeks to correct a recent interpretation by the Federal Court of the application of GST law. In doing so, the bill returns GST law to the original intention when the GST was legislated back in 1999 and began operation in 2000. It would be remiss of me not to mention in speaking on this schedule-and we obviously welcome it-that it was this side of the House that introduced the goods and services tax, and the intention was quite clear. In technical terms, the Federal Court sometime ago contradicted the intent of the law relating to incapacitated entities. The minister has outlined in great detail and the explanatory memorandum outlines in great detail how this simply returns the legal situation back to the original intention. It was widely made clear that this would happen back MAIN COMMITTEE",250,Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2009
234,Mr Butler (Port Adelaide,Parliamentary Secretary for Health) (11.42 am)-I think all,252,Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2009
235,Mr Anthony Smith (Casey) (11.45 Am),"I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendin February, when the Assistant Treasurer committed to doing just this down the track. So there has, from our view and in a bipartisan way, been certainty about this issue for a period of time, and we are now picking it up in a formal legislative sense in this bill. I welcome the fact that those opposite-including my friend and colleague the member for Melbourne Ports, who I have known for a very long time and who is in the chamber-are legislating in this tax law amendment bill on the goods and services tax. Every time they legislate on the goods and services tax it is of course a reminder of their now support, embrace and love of the goods and services tax. The member for Melbourne Ports, who was in this place to vote against the goods and services tax-and he is a friend of mine, I’m happy to say-is now, once again, going to be in a position to vote for the integrity of the goods and services tax. That is a great thing and he will take great joy out of knowing he was wrong 10 years ago. Now that he has seen the light he has a chance to make up for that wrong and vote for the integrity of the goods and services tax. Being 2009, I also find it impossible-and the member for Melbourne Ports would know this-not to mention in the context of the goods and services tax the 10th anniversary of fundamental injustice day, which was declared by the Prime Minister when he was then in opposition and speaking on the goods and services tax bill. He declared the day that the GST was being legislated through the House of Representatives was ‘a day of fundamental injustice’ that people would look back on, and I must look back on it-the member for Melbourne Ports would expect me to do nothing less. It was quite Rooseveltian. It raised images of days of infamy and Pearl Harbor. This was going to be a great and terrible moment in the history of Australia that people would look back on in 100 years time. It is great that just 10 years later, which is a long period of time, we are looking back and have officials responsible for the integrity of the tax act. It is great that in 10 years time there is no anniversary celebration of fundamental injustice day and no marching in the streets to recognise the horror of this day 10 years on. In fact, the person who declared ‘fundamental injustice day’ is now Prime Minister of the country, presiding over the goods and services tax and protecting the very integrity of it here today. That, of course, is a good thing. There are some on the other side-and I suspect, without being unfair, that my friend the member for Melbourne Ports is one of those-who all along knew that the goods and services tax was an important reform for our country. If that is not the case, he now is legislating something he does not believe in, and that is an accusation I would never make. ‘Fundamental injustice day’ aside, you will understand that, even on a tax law amendment bill on a number of technical issues, I find it absolutely impossible not to recall these events for the chamber. There is no way, having covered those important events, to traverse neatly into schedule 2 of the bill, which deals with taxation of financial arrangements, but I will deal with that very quickly. This schedule as it relates to the TOFA regime, which has been a long standing reform issue begun by the previous government, has bipartisan support. This schedule relates to provisions of the pay-as-you-go obligations and it ensures that the introduction of those TOFA reforms does not enable the situation to occur where PAYG instalments can be reduced. Schedules 3 and 4 of this bill affirm and make clear that certain payments are tax exempt. That was always the intention and the case with so many payments, but this bill, in a belt-andbraces way, ensures that those payments are tax exempt. Schedule3 deals with payments MAIN COMMITTEE made with respect to autism, specifically the outer regional and remote payments made under the Helping Children with Autism package. It ensures those payments are exempt from income tax, as they should be. That has always been the intention, but this tax law amendment bill is necessary to remove beyond any doubt that those payments made to families living in regional or remote areas remain tax exempt. Similarly, schedule 4 ensures that payments made under the Continence Aids Assistance Scheme are also exempt from tax. Schedule5 extends interest withholding tax exemption to debt issued by the Commonwealth. This really mirrors earlier legislation in a tax law amendment bill-I think at the start of the year-with respect to the states and territories. Last year the coalition supported the passage of that when it was announced and this extends that exemption to debt issued by the Commonwealth. Schedule6 deals with some critical tax issues that have been complicated and have taken a period of time to resolve. I know the member for Melbourne Ports, as a fellow Victorian, will appreciate all of these issues. It relates specifically to the tragic bushfires that occurred in Victoria at the start of this year. As those opposite know and as my friend and colleague the chair of the economics committee knows, Australians from every corner gave generously to that fund. It was not just people in Victoria-every corner of Australia gave generously to that fund. The strength of those donations really demonstrated that community spirit we are so proud of in Australia. The schedule enacts an announcement from the Assistant Treasurer on 17 August. It allows for the Victorian Bushfire Appeal Trust to undertake a range of recovery assistance projects without any risk of the Red Cross losing its charitable status. Essentially, it means that those generous donations can be used in a wider variety of ways than would ordinarily be deemed to be charitable purposes under the law. This was complicated because the law relating to charities is very strictly defined. Clearly in the case of the bushfires and people making donations, the first step that we did here in this Main Committee at the time with the former Assistant Treasurer, Mr Bowen, was to ensure that the payments going into that fund were tax-deductible. The issue now is to ensure that those funds can be spent for the best purpose, that is, to help the most affected communities in the way that they want to be helped. The law relating to charities is very strictly defined. Without going through the history of it, which goes back over a very long period of time, a lot of things that we would expect to be able to be done were not able to be done with any legal certainty. It was frustrating because it has taken time to get the tax law right on this but essentially these amendments specifically enable that fund to spend money on a wider range of activities. They include providing long term assistance to orphans aged under 18 years, reimbursing individuals or charitable organisations for eligible activities, providing assistance to individuals whose primary place of residence was destroyed by the bushfires, providing up to $15,000 in financial assistance to individuals who have lived or are still living in transitional housing, and providing up to $10,000 in financial assistance to primary producers. These amendments were, as I said, announced by the Assistant Treasurer back in August. He consulted with me prior to that announcement, and the announcement and this legislation ensure that the amendments have an effective date just prior to the Black Saturday bushfires-they are backdated to the fires that began in Delburn in Gippsland on 29 January. MAIN COMMITTEE While tax law amendment bills deal with a whole range of matters, this is an important piece of law; it is a piece of law that ensures that recovery continues with some certainty in what has been a terrible year for those families and those communities in Victoria. We have supported legislation in this regard all along and we are very glad that it is before the House today and enacting that announcement of the Assistant Treasurer. follow the member for Casey. He always has some gems to share with the House in his contributions. I always used to see him as one of the progressive Liberal Party members and hewe have some of his colleagues harking back to views of the last century, the member for Casey is only stuck in the last decade. In terms of the Liberal Party and where he is, he is one of the progressives, which is good to see. It is always a little bit sad when you hear the member for Casey talking about the history of the Liberal Party through his rose coloured glasses. It almost brings a tear to your eye, talking about the glory days that used to be. But it is always a pleasure to follow him in terms of his contributions. I rise to support theTax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 5) Bill 2009. There are six schedules in this bill and I will endeavour to look at each one in a little detail. Firstly, schedule 1, as an overview, protects the GST revenue in light of an adverse Federal Court decision handed down on 12 December 2008. The decision in the Deputy Commissioner of Taxationv PM Developments Pty Ltd is contrary to the stated policy intention that the representative of an incapacitated entity is liable for GST on transactions within the scope of its appointment. It is also contrary to the Commissioner of Taxation’s administration of the law since the introduction of the GST. These amendments will amend the GST law with effect from 1 July 2000 to ensure the law achieves the stated policy objective. Schedule2 amends the pay as you go, or PAYG, instalment provisions to address unintended consequences arising out of amendments to those provisions contained in the Tax Law Amendment (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Act 2009. The effect of the PAYG amendments to the TOFA Act is arguably to substantially change the basis on which a PAYG instalment liability is calculated but this had the potential to decrease PAYG instalment payments. Any decrease will result in deferral of revenue which will be recouped when the relevant taxpayer lodges the income-tax return. Schedule3 exempts from income tax the outer regional and remote payment made under the Helping Children with Autism package. Schedule4 exempts from income tax those payments made under the Continence Aids Payment Scheme. Schedule5 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to extend eligibility for exemption from interest withholding tax to debt issued by the Commonwealth or Commonwealth authorities. Schedule6 provides the Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund independent advisory panel with greater scope to support communities affected by the 2009 Victorian bushfires. Looking at these amendments in a little bit more detail, under schedule 1, the Federal Court decision in the Deputy Commissioner of Taxationv PM Developments Pty Ltd handed down on 12 December 2008 held that a liquidator is not liable for the GST arising from transactions occurring during the period of the liquidator’s appointment. Instead, the court held that the MAIN COMMITTEE",252,Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2009

237,Mr Chester,And he is!,255,Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2009
238,Mr Craig Thomson,"Well he probably is because, unlike in the ETS debate whereGST liability is a liability of the company in liquidation. The Federal Court decision is contrary to the stated policy intention that the representative of an incapacitated entity is liable for GST on transactions within the scope of its appointment. It is also contrary to the Commissioner of Taxation’s administration of the GST law. The proposed amendments are intended to restore the stated policy intention with effect from 1 July 2000, the introduction date of the GST, and we heard in such eloquent terms from the member for Casey his long standing commitment to these laws. Transitional provisions will apply to ensure that the amendments do not adversely impact taxpayers who have complied with the commissioner’s interpretation of the law or who have acted in good faith. The proposed amendments will provide that a representative of an incapacitated entity is liable or entitled to the GST consequences of transactions within the scope of its appointment. For example, when a representative sells an asset of an incapacitated entity, if the sale is subject to GST and the price therefore is GST inclusive the representative will be liable to pay GST of 1/11th of the sale price to the commissioner. Similarly, if a representative purchases assets as part of managing the affairs of an incapacitated entity he will be entitled to claim an input tax credit to offset the GST included in the purchase price. The imposition of liability on a representative only relates to post-appointment GST amounts that are in relation to transactions within the control of the representative. Pre-existing GST liabilities remain with the incapacitated entity. The revenue impact of the court’s decision if no action is taken is estimated to be a reduction of $655 million over the forward estimates period, representing refunds of GST paid by representatives and ongoing revenue costs. The proposed amendments will have a nil or negligible impact over the forward estimates period as they seek to restore the status quo. We need to ensure that the GST revenue of $655 million which I have just outlined is protected over the forward estimates. The Federal Court decision is contrary to the stated policy intention that the representative of an incapacitated entity is liable for GST on transactions within the scope of its appointment. It is also contrary the Commissioner of Taxation’s administration of this law since the introduction of the GST. Retrospective amendment is not expected to adversely affect taxpayers but will protect the revenue by preventing claims for refunds of amounts paid by representatives of incapacitated entities. Turning to schedule 2 of the bill covering the pay-as-you-go instalments and taxation of financial arrangements interaction issues, the amendment contained in this schedule reverses the changes the Taxation of Financial Arrangements Act made to PAYG instalment systems, thus preventing a potential decrease in the amount of PAYG instalments paid. In addition, the amendment ensures that where an entity has become liable to pay a decreased amount of PAYG instalment prior to the commencement of this bill there will be a catch-up payment of the decreased amount in the quarter that ends after the commencement of this bill. The government intends to undertake consultation on a more appropriate method of addressing the interactions between the PAYG instalment system and the TOFA Act on an ongoing basis. The government is committed to the ongoing monitoring of the implementation of the taxation of financial arrangements reforms. The changes in schedule 2 address an unintended consequence arising out of the changes the TOFA reforms made to the PAYG instalment system. It is the intention of the government to develop a more appropriate method of dealing with the interactions between PAYG instalment systems and the TOFA Act. MAIN COMMITTEE Schedule3 of the bill concerns the Helping Children with Autism package. Schedule3 exempts from income tax the outer regional and remote payments made under the Helping Children with Autism package. This payment is designed to assist families with children who have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and living in outer regional and remote areas to access early intervention and educational services. Exempting this payment from tax reflects the added difficulties that could be faced by families living in regional or rural areas in gaining access to these types of services. The exemption provides the recipients of this payment with certainty as to the tax status of those payments. Schedule4 exempts from income tax those payments made under the Continence Aids Payment Scheme. This scheme replaces the existing scheme which provides subsidised products direct to eligible recipients. The replacement of the direct provision of the products with a payment allows eligible recipients greater freedom in their choice of products and suppliers. Providing an income tax exemption for the receipt of this payment will ensure that no recipients are disadvantaged under the new scheme. Schedule5 covers exempting Commonwealth government securities from interest withholding tax. This proposal will make debt issued by the Commonwealth, including debt issued by the Australian Office of Financial Management and other Commonwealth authorities, such as Australia Post, eligible for exemption from interest withholding tax. This policy will improve neutrality in the tax system by providing Commonwealth debt, state debt and private sector debt with the same interest withholding tax treatment. It will also bring Australia’s tax treatment of Commonwealth government securities into line with most other countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. Foreign investors investing in AAA-rated sovereign bonds currently have a choice between purchasing AAA-rated IWT-exempt bonds, such as those from the US, Germany, United Kingdom and state governments, or purchasing AAA-rated Australian government bonds and potentially paying IWT. This places Australian government bonds issuance at a competitive disadvantage in the international market and potentially results in the Australian government bonds being issued at a higher yield than would be the case were an IWT exemption available. It is expected that making Commonwealth government securities eligible for the current general IWT exemption will increase demand for Commonwealth government securities from overseas investors who have previously been deterred by the tax. The taxation changes will have a net cost of $52.4 million across the forward estimates. Finally, schedule 6 of this act addresses the 2009 Victorian Bushfire Appeal trust account. These amendments provide the Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund independent advisory panel with greater scope to support communities affected by the 2009 Victorian bushfires. The panel oversees the expenditure of funds in the 2009 Victorian Bushfire Appeal trust account. The amendments permit funds in the appeal fund to be used for a broader range of purposes than the law would consider charitable, without jeopardising the charitable status of that charity that collects donations. The amendments ensure that any funds transferred from the Red Cross to the appeal fund, which is not itself a charitable fund or institution, will be disregarded in considering the Red Cross’ status as a charitable institution and a public benevolence institution so long as the funds are used for the allowable purposes. The allowable purposes for which the funds may MAIN COMMITTEE be expended are restricted to provide assurance to donors that their charitable donations will be used appropriately. There are a number of allowable purposes but broadly they fit into three categories: Australian disaster relief fund purposes, public benefit purposes and other allowable purposes. Any purpose that is currently allowable under the general deductible gift recipient category of the Australian disaster relief fund will continue to be an allowable purpose. An allowable public benefit purpose would be a purpose to provide broad public benefits that are consistent with the purposes of one or more income tax-exempt entities, widely and publicly accessible, and provide commercial or private benefits only to an incidental and ancillary extent, if at all. ‘Public benefit’ means the organisation must have a purpose aimed at achieving a universal or common good and that its benefits are accessible and directed to the general community. There are a number of categories of entity which are made income tax exempt in tax law, generally in recognition of their value to the community. These categories include, amongst others, charitable institutions, community service organisations, cultural organisations, health organisations, sporting organisations and local government bodies. To be consistent with the purpose of an income tax exempt entity, the funds must be used for activities that would be undertaken by an income tax exempt entity. This is a wide category of newly permissible purposes for the panel and includes rebuilding or establishing community centres, youth centres, halls or libraries and other similar purposes which meet the requirements of a public benefit purpose. They are very important in helping to rebuild these communities. Other allowable purposes include: the provision, without any requirement for annual assessments, of long-term assistance to orphaned minors; reimbursement of individuals or organisations who have paid for either Australian disaster relief fund activities or public benefit activities to be performed; provision of support to individuals who, because of the bushfires, have lived or are living in transitional housing-grants of up to $15,000 per household may be provided; assistance to individuals who are primary producers-the amendment allows the appeal fund to make grants of up to $10,000 to primary producers, which are open to be used for repair and restoration of farm activities, including re-fencing properties; and provision of assistance to families whose owner-occupied principal residence has been destroyed or damaged, ignoring the legal ownership structure of the residents-this has relevance to individuals who may use company or trust structures to own their residence. Recognising the truly unprecedented circumstances of the 2009 Victorian bushfires, the government is implementing legislative changes that widen the permitted use of donations by the fund. These amendments will give the Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund Independent Advisory Panel extra flexibility to support bushfire affected communities as they recover and rebuild. This decision follows a significant amount of support from the Rudd government over the past six months. This includes appointing a Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire ConstructionMr Shorten, the member for Maribyrnong-to spearhead reconstruction efforts and providing a range of financial and other assistance to individuals, families, businesses and communities affected by these fires. As you can see, the amendments in this bill cover a broad range of issues, all of which make our tax system a fairer one. I commend the bill to the House. (2009 Measures No. 5) Bill 2009. Without wishing to diminish the other schedules, which MAIN COMMITTEE",255,Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2009
239,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (12.12 Pm),"I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendmentwere so eloquently covered by the member for Dobell, I join the debate to mainly focus on two areas of particular concern to my community, being those issues dealing with the Helping Children with Autism package and schedule 6, which relates to the Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund. As the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services and Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction noted in his second reading speech, schedule 3 exempts from income tax the outer regional and remote payment made under the Helping Children with Autism package. This payment is made to assist families with children who have been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder and who live in outer regional and remote areas to access otherwise scarce early intervention and education services. The amount of that allowance is $2,000, and I will discuss that more fully later in my contribution. Schedule6 provides greater scope for the Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund Independent Advisory Panel to support the communities affected by the 2009 Victorian bushfires. In relation to the bushfires and the broader discussion, this is an opportunity for me to update the House on the recovery initiatives that are underway in Gippsland and to report some progress. It is now almost eight months since that tragic event. To begin with, I want to again put on record my absolute respect and admiration for the emergency services workers and all the volunteers who have rallied together so magnificently, not only in Gippsland but right across the state of Victoria. If there has been a single positive aspect to have arisen from this tragedy, it is the way it has united my community. The test that was put to the people of Gippsland was quite extraordinary, but the resilience they have demonstrated in the last eight months is something to behold and something I am very proud of as the member for that region. We lost 11 lives in Gippsland at the height of the fires on Black Saturday and more than 250 homes in the 10 days where fires scorched across the communities of Ballara, Yallah, Callignee, Traralgon South through to Cornella and right through to Devon North. It was a very traumatic event and a tragedy on a scale that I hope none of us see again in our lifetime. There are probably people in the gallery here today who were affected by the Canberra bushfires, and they would probably understand the extent of the trauma that the people of Gippsland have gone through. In the immediate aftermath people have dealt with their losses. There was a certain degree of shock in our community, which is entirely understandable. But what has been on display, as I mentioned before, is the overwhelming support and the outpouring of generosity from people right across Australia. Everyone wanted to do their bit. It was quite extraordinary to go to a place like the Traralgon South recovery centre and see trucks pull up, full of goods, the sorts of goods that you do not think of automatically-things like work boots and overalls for the men wanting to get back on to their blocks and start cleaning up; fencing and repair material donated by major agricultural companies; and cosmetic and medicinal supplies from some of Australia’s major providers, such as pamper packs for the ladies and those who had lost everything. So it was an incredible experience to be there in those early days and to see the outpouring of support that came from people right throughout Australia-from the corporate sector, from the voluntary sector and from individuals keen to do their bit. We were very fortunate in Gippsland to be served by the Gippsland Emergency Relief Fund. It went quickly into action. It secured several million dollars worth of donations from the immediate local community and was handing out cheques to people from day 1. I comMAIN COMMITTEE mend the Gippsland Emergency Relief Fund for being able to dispense aid so quickly and when people needed it. Keep in mind that people were turning up to the relief and recovery centres with absolutely no form of identification, just with the clothes on their backs. To turn up and to have someone give them a cheque so they could go and buy some new clothes was something that they certainly appreciated. The broader appeal effort, which this amendment deals with, raised $375 million. That is testament to the care and compassion of the Australian public. We hear a lot of negative stories in the media, but I think we should focus on this incredible performance by the Australian public. I am well aware of many school groups who held casual days, for example, or kids who held garage sales to raise money. They made donations of $10, $20, $50 or $100; and every little bit helped. I commend the Victorian Bushfire Appeal coordinators and Governor John Landy. The project is now chaired by Pat McNamara, a former leader in the Victorian state parliament. I commend them on the work they have done. It has been difficult for them to work through the parameters of the task before them. One of the perhaps disturbing aspects of this issue, and the reason why I have taken this opportunity to speak today, is that there may be a sense in the broader community that the recovery has finished now-that we can all move on now that the media interest has died down and now that the bushfires are not on the front pages of the newspapers anymore-a sense that the communities of Gippsland, and the broader community of Victoria, affected by these fires have been fixed and it is all done and dusted. That is certainly not the case. We were very appreciative of the visits by the Prime Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary for Bushfire Reconstruction and several other ministers. They made the time to come to Gippsland and to carefully assess the local needs on the ground. I urge them, if they have been to Gippsland in the past, to return in the future. They would certainly be welcomed by the community. There is a sense for some in the community that they have now been forgotten. It does not need to be a rational view; it can be just an emotional reaction to the fact that they have been on the ground now for eight months trying to rebuild their lives. So it would do well for other members in this place to consider what opportunities they may have in the execution of their parliamentary duties to look for ways that they can get back into those communities. I am talking about not just Gippsland but also the broader bushfire affected communities as they recover from what has been, as I said, an incredibly traumatic experience. As time has gone by there is no question that the media interest has dropped and the visits from people outside the region have dropped. I get the sense now that the community is ready for more support in the sense of just knowing that people still care about them. There have been some exceptions to that rule about interest dropping. The local media has been very focused on the recovery effort, and I commend the journalists in our area for their efforts in that regard. The ABC statewide radio program Drive is hosted by Kathy Bedford, a good friend and colleague of mine who has gone out of her way to try to keep in touch with the fire affected communities and make sure her listeners, right around regional Victoria, understand that they need to be there for these people for the long haul, because recovery is very much a long haul. People recover at very different rates. Some people seem quite remarkable as their resilience is incredible and they seemed to have bounced back very quickly. They have taken on enormous burdens in their communities and got on with the job of helping othMAIN COMMITTEE ers and helping their own families. As for others, we are talking about six to eight months down the track and sometimes there have been delays in getting permits to start building and family breakdowns as a direct result of the fires because some people simply cannot go back to those communities; they do not want to move back and rebuild in the same location when their partner might think it is a very good idea to move back. That level of social disconnection or breakdown is a real issue that we are dealing with in Gippsland at the moment. I have said many times in Gippsland that this will be a defining moment in our community and the lives of so many people. They will define their lives as to what they did before Black Saturday and what they did after Black Saturday. It will be a turning point for a lot of people. I am concerned for our young people in particular, that we have not always been fully cognisant of their needs given that they were very much at the firefront and were directly affected. I give credit to an organisation called Relationships Australia, which has gone out of its way in the past two weeks to hold an adolescents recovery day. Several hundred young teenagers came together for the day to enjoy some music and sit around with their mates in a relaxing environment. It is typical of the vagaries of the Gippsland climate that on that day rain poured down and washed out some of the events, a day when we were to there to reflect on a day when a 46-degree temperature scorched the area. So we had two inches of rain on a day when we would have preferred to be outside enjoying some of the other activities that were organised. Young people received some important messages that day to make sure they realised that they can seek help, that seeking help does not make you any less of a man or a woman if you are not dealing well with the trauma of the events that you have experienced and need to go out and get professional advice, and that it is okay to admit things are not necessarily going that well. I congratulate Relationships Australia for helping to build that bridge for our young people, so making them realise they have not been forgotten. Obviously, the long haul of recovery also relates to the environment. The damage that has been done to the Victorian bush has been quite significant. If you travel through the bushfire affected areas now, you note the vegetation is starting to re-establish itself and it is greening up again. The large mammals one used to see are not there yet in any numbers, if at all. It is a long haul, and I give credit to the federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestryand we have our clashes from time to time on a whole range of issues-for coming down to Gippsland and taking the time to see how the bushfires affected my community and also for making sure that additional Landcare funding is made available for the practical environmental work that is going to be required in the months ahead. As I have mentioned before, there was very much a bipartisan spirit in the early days after the bushfires. The Prime Minister visited the area, as did the minister for agriculture. I had a chance to take the minister around to see the infrastructure work that is required, and the infrastructure upgrades are also going to take a fair bit of time to complete. That is why I am particularly pleased by the changes that have been made in terms of the tax treatment of the bushfire relief appeal fund. One issue that seemed to slip through the cracks in the early days was primary producers’ need to repair and restore their on-farm equipment and activities, in particular fencing. We had hundreds of kilometres of fencing destroyed in Gippsland. I have seen the figures but they have escaped from my memory at the moment. I know there were thousands of kilometres of fencing destroyed across Victoria. Inevitably, in this area we are going to have future disasters, whether they be fires or floods, and we are going to lose fencMAIN COMMITTEE ing again. It almost seems as if it is going to be inevitable that we are going to again have this fight about what support is going to be made available to our primary producers when they are faced with such an enormous cost burden. We have a situation, one that needs to change, at a state level whereby where properties adjoin public land the state government does not assist with the replacement of fences. I think that is an issue that the state government needs to take on board coming out of this enormous tragedy across Victoria. The bill before the House follows some pretty practical, common-sense discussions that were had with the Prime Minister’s office, with the parliamentary secretary’s office and also with the members for McMillan and McEwen. It ensures that our primary producers do have access to some of the funding. I think the Australian public is quite comfortable with that. The funding in the initial stages went to people who lost their primary place of residence, who had major loss of property. But, given the magnitude of the fund-$375 million-I understand that the recovery fund committee have not been able to spend all the money at this stage. So it is quite reasonable to look at other options. I give credit to the government for moving in this regard. In particular, changes provided for in the bill will allow the fund to provide long-term assistance to orphaned minors. I am not sure of the exact numbers, but I have read of many cases where young people have lost both their parents. It also provides reimbursements to individuals or organisations that have performed eligible charitable activities and it makes the discretionary payments I referred to before. The bill is certainly going to be well received by the people of Gippsland. It is a small but welcome step in recognition of the need for additional support as we go forward. I encourage all members and those of the general public who may be listening today to recognise that the recovery is ongoing. It has been an extraordinarily difficult and complex process. We are going to need continued support for communities and the people in them for many years to come. I also want to refer to schedule 3 of the bill, which exempts from the income tax declarations the regional and remote payments made under the Helping Children with Autism package. Again, this is an important initiative and I commend the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services for taking it. We have an issue in our regional communities in particular. We need to make sure we are doing a hell of a lot more to provide decent levels of support and assistance to people with autism and their families. When the autism diagnosis comes, people liken it to a time bomb. When it goes off, when the diagnosis is made, mums and dads return home and wonder what they do next. There is a lack of support services in regional communities. I have written to the minister on this in the past, and I understand he is working in that regard. This is a very positive step towards ensuring that people in rural and regional communities have reasonable access to services in the future. Our carers are on the front line when it comes to providing a service for our nation. It is the toughest gig in town. Dealing with a child with special needs, whether it be autism or some other special need, is exhausting. The parents are often confused by the layers of bureaucracy they need to go through to access services. It can be very difficult for them to keep their family unit together while they are dealing with so many other emotionally draining issues. I have met with several families in my electorate who have had the diagnosis of autism. The experience follows a very similar pattern. There is a need for allied health services in the first place, MAIN COMMITTEE but there is also a need for respite care. Families want to work their way through the system by using a one-stop shop approach. There is one program that has been very successful in the Bairnsdale community which I have written to the minister about. I congratulated him on the funding for it. That is the MyTime program. It provides a helper for up to eight children at one time to allow the parents to get together in a room and discuss their different ideas and the ways they are coping with a child with autism. Parents who have spoken to me are seeking the establishment of a one-stop shop which really helps them to identify support services and tells them where and how they can access them. I congratulate the minister for his interest in the issue. I also encourage him to continue to lobby hard for additional support services. Some of the concerns raised by people in Gippsland link into the government’s new package of $12,000 over two years for children with autism spectrum disorder. It is a good package, but there are some concerns within my community in relation to how people can actually access the services and whether they are available to them. I have spoken to families about this, and the information they have given to me is that early intervention is critical when it comes to autism. It is those first few years where you can make a real difference in helping young people achieve their absolute best later in life. There have been various international studies which have found that a young child with autism should have access to, for example, at least 12 hours of therapy per week, be it occupational therapy, behavioural therapy or speech therapy. But the package the government has implemented of $6,000 per year equates to about one hour per week. I know the families do not wish to appear ungrateful for that package, but it falls a long way short of where we need to go in the longer term. Low-income families and people from low socioeconomic areas have a great deal of difficulty in topping up the support services. It is only natural that parents want to get the absolute best for their children, but if you are a full-time carer obviously it can be difficult to earn the income to access the extra support services which are needed. I do commend the government for the autism support package which is available but I acknowledge that there is a long way to go in providing the services which meet the needs of our community. Another problem with the package at the moment is that you must be an authorised provider to have the $6,000 spent on your service. In the early days, there certainly were not any authorised service providers in my region; that is about to change in Bairnsdale, I understand. In other regions where approved service providers are not available, it is still going to be a problem for the government, going forward. That is where the $2,000 allowance for remote and regional access fits into this package, but it is a real issue for children with autism in particular to be travelling long distances to access services. The children themselves do not travel that well in a large number of cases and it just adds another stress and layer of complexity for the families involved. So the $2,000 certainly helps, but we do have a long way to go in providing access to those types of services within the regional communities themselves. I had the opportunity to speak to a paediatrician in Sale during the week who does a great job supporting children with autism. I think he has 150 children with autism on his books at the moment. He is comfortable with the package in that regard, but he does make the point that we do need to be investing more in our own young people in regional communities to make sure that we actually have those allied health services available in country communities MAIN COMMITTEE in the future. Taking our young people with autism to Melbourne to access the services to use this funding is not an adequate solution for us. In the longer term, it simply will not change until more rural students are given preferential treatment to enter university courses and then given the opportunity to move back to regional communities to practise after the completion of their studies. I thank the House for this opportunity to provide an update on the bushfire recovery efforts in Gippsland and also on the autism package. I commend the bill to the House. knowledge his very strong advocacy for the constituents of his electorate. I acknowledge the representation that he has given them through what has been a very difficult period, having faced the bushfires earlier this year and the great challenge of reconstruction that has followed. I will speak more specifically about that in relation to schedule 6 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 5) Bill 2009 later on. I do not intend to speak on each of the schedules of the bill, but I will be speaking on schedules 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Beginning with schedule 1, the proposals that have been brought forward in relation to the GST and representatives of incapacitated entities, I note that these are amendments that have been precipitated by a Federal Court decision which determined a matter in such a way as to render the outcome contradictory to what was the stated intention of the GST legislation when it was first introduced. That legislative intention is given effect by the comments that were made in the explanatory memorandum at the time. It is a timely reminder of the importance of ensuring that, while an explanatory memorandum can play an important role in providing some additional context and some additional guidance as to the intention of the legislation, it never takes on the force of law in its own right. This is something that draftspeople have to be eternally vigilant about, and this particular case does highlight some of the difficulties-where the messages being sent out in the explanatory memorandum can, in fact, be contradictory to the letter of the law contained within the act itself. In relation to the judgement that has given rise to these particular amendments, that was the case involving PM Developments and the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. I note that in handing down the judgement Justice Logan was critical of the explanatory memorandum to the goods and services tax act. The explanatory memorandum stated, at paragraph 6.271, if you are registered and you become bankrupt, or go into receivership or liquidation, the person who conducts your enterprise on your behalf is, generally, personally carrying on the enterprise. In addressing that part of the explanatory memorandum, Justice Logan said: The statement in para 6.271 of the explanatory memorandum as to who carries on an enterprise after bankruptcy, receivership or liquidation is true only of bankruptcy. It is not true of corporations who are placed in liquidation. Neither is it true of a privately appointed receiver. He then goes on to say: Such errors hardly, with respect, inspire confidence in the utility of the explanatory memorandum. The description in the explanatory memorandum is not matched by the language employed within Div I47 as enacted. MAIN COMMITTEE",258,Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2009
240,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay) (12.32 Pm),"In following the member for Gippsland, I acThat serves to amplify the point that the use or the utility, the benefit, of the explanatory memorandum and the guidance that it purports to provide to taxpayers, to advisers and ultimately to courts, is only useful to the extent that it is not seek to derogate from-or undermine or contradict-the written word of the act itself. I think that, whilst this particular set of amendments does seek to restore what may have been generally understood to have been the position, as I indicated earlier, I think it does serve as a useful reminder of the importance of maintaining complete and utter care in the way in which an explanatory memorandum is drafted, because of the particular significance these documents can take in guiding thoseparticularly in the tax field-in advising clients and ensuring that taxpayers understand their obligations and are able to set about diligently trying to observe them. That is the only comment I wish to make in relation to schedule 1 but I support the proposals. In relation to schedules 3 and 4, I want to offer a few general comments. In relation to schedule 3-the Helping Children with Autism package-whilst I note that this particular schedule exempts from income-tax those payments made under the outer regional and remote payment, I do acknowledge that the package is one that has delivered considerable benefits to families and communities right around the country. I know that it has been very well received in my local community. Autism presents a great challenge, in particular to the families of children who are given a diagnosis. The Helping Children with Autism package is principally designed to provide that assistance, so that early intervention services can be obtained and secured. The research is very clear that early intervention services can have a profound impact on the outcomes in terms of the extent to which the child might improve their functioning within the community. It is important that we continue to invest in providing support to families who-I must say, in my community-have limited access to the services they need. Notwithstanding those limitations, one of the largest limitations is the capacity to access those services financially, whether it be for speech therapists occupational therapists or for music therapy. There is a particular issue with music therapy because within my electorate the NordoffRobbins Foundation has provided considerable funding over the years for the Golden Stave Music Therapy Centre, which is located at the Kingswood campus of the University of Western Sydney. The music therapy that is provided-not just to children but teenagers and adults more generally, even some elderly people-can play a very important role in providing some of the therapeutic components to the overall strategy that one might employ in trying to assist a person with autism. Unfortunately, some of those services traditionally have not been of the type of service that would be considered as being eligible to be funded under these sorts of packages. That is something that I would like to see further work done on for people who are accessing those services, and ensuring that some of those music therapy services are in fact delivering benefits that are just as great as an occupational therapist or a speech therapist for a child that has autism. RecentlyI had the opportunity in my electorate to support a very worthy cause that I have mentioned before in this place, and that is the Luke Priddis Foundation. It was established to provide services and assistance to families that have children with autism. Just a couple of weeks ago I attended their annual fundraising event at St Marys Leagues Club. It was a trivia night and I am pleased to report to the House that my table came second by a quarter of a point-it was one of those four-point answers that brought us undone in the end. It was a MAIN COMMITTEE great night, not just because of the entertainment and the fun that was to be had on the evening, but because of the money that was raised for a very good cause. I do wish to acknowledge Luke and Holly Priddis and the entire team at the Luke Priddis Foundation for the great work that they do-not just in raising funds but most significantly in raising the profile of autism and the need for autism-specific services in Western Sydney. I take my hat off to the Luke Priddis Foundation. I wish to thank them for a good night and for the great work that they do within our community. On the night Emma Husar, a local mother-her son Mitch is autistic-was able to speak to those who were in attendance about the particular challenges that she has faced as a parent of a child with autism. For those of us who are parents, I think we all look at the great job done by parents who find themselves in very difficult and trying circumstances. We look at the great job that they do with utter respect and a great deal of admiration, and I wish to express that here today. This particular measure obviously ensures that there is a relevant tax exemption for those payments made under that payment. In relation to the Continence Aids Payments Scheme, I note that this particular proposal has arisen as a result of some of the changes that have occurred to the administration of the scheme-the CAAS scheme, the continence aids assistance scheme, is what it was previously known as. The changes that have been brought about ensure that now there is more choice in the hands of the recipient of a payment to go out and to source the particular product. The way in which the scheme has been structured means there are payments being made to recipients, to individuals, and this provision is largely to ensure that there are no adverse income tax consequences that flow from those payments. Frankly, it would put people at a disadvantage if they were now paying income tax or those payments were treated as being assessable in their hands when under the previous system there were no such taxation implications. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the very good work in my community of the Nepean Social Club, which is a club that was established under the leadership of Kevin Finlayson, a great local identity. Kevin is in a wheelchair but he is someone who has been driving many a process in the advancement of the interests of people with disabilities in my local community over many years. He was awarded the coveted Wall of Achievement Award by the Penrith City Council some years ago. Kevin was the driving force behind establishing the Nepean Social Club. This issue under schedule 5, along with a range of other issues affecting people with disabilities, is one that he has brought to my personal attention, so I wish to acknowledge his advocacy. I know that he is a great leader within my local community and will continue to speak out and advocate on behalf of the members of his club but also, more generally, people with disabilities. The next schedule, schedule 5, deals with exempting Commonwealth government securities from interest withholding tax. This is an eminently sensible proposal and I note that it has bipartisan support. This is a change that has largely been necessitated by the succession of changes that have occurred in relation to the removal of interest withholding tax on corporate bonds which occurred back in 1999 and, more recently, on state government securities in 2008. This measure is principally about neutrality, ensuring that bonds of a similar type are treated similarly for taxation purposes. The main effect of the interest withholding tax provisions goes to the competitiveness of bonds that are issued by the Commonwealth government. MAIN COMMITTEE Foreign investors with an appetite for investing in triple-A rated sovereign bonds currently have a choice between purchasing those triple-A rated interest withholding tax exempt bonds from other countries or indeed, within Australia, other jurisdictions, and acquiring those securities from the Commonwealth where, under the current law, there is no such exemption from the imposition of interest withholding tax. This is a levelling of the playing field in that respect. It is a very sensible move, one that has some financial implications. It is estimated that the net cost of this measure will be $52.4 million across the forward estimates. However, it is important to note that a large part of that will be offset by the increased demand that the removal of interest withholding tax from Commonwealth government securities will generate in that particular investment space. It is a proposal that I wholeheartedly support. Schedule6 is concerned with the response by the Australian community and the Australian government to the Victorian bushfires earlier this year. The member for Gippsland spoke very genuinely, very passionately and very sincerely about the impact that those fires had on his community and also the impact of the response that came from the rest of Australia to help his local community try and rebuild. These amendments are largely directed towards ensuring that the widely held view within the community, and I think a view that has a very reasonable basis, is upheld. That view is that not only should the contributions that people made to the Red Cross in the first instance, at a time of national emergency and for which as individuals they received a tax deductionand it is widely accepted in this country that donations of this sort should be tax deductiblebe tax deductible but the way in which the mechanical transfer of those funds has occurred from the Red Cross to the appeal fund of which the Victorian government is the trustee should not in any way jeopardise the ongoing availability of the charitable status of the Red Cross. The government and the parliament have acted to ensure that the appeal fund is a deductible gift recipient. These amendments largely go to the more broad issue of the expenditure of those funds. Whilst there might be a need to extend beyond the limits of the existing provisions of the tax law to ensure that some of the items of expenditure that this bill proposes would be allowed to occur without jeopardising the charitable status of the entities involved, I think it is entirely reasonable to conclude that those expenditures are completely in line with what not only the donors, being the rest of the Australian community, expect but also what the Australian government considers to be fair and reasonable. In acting on this particular proposal, the parliament will support that initiative and enshrine that in law. I am inspired by the fund-raising efforts that have contributed to the relief fund. In the order of $386 million has been raised, 18,324 payments have been made to individuals affected by bushfires, three-quarters of the fund will be paid out to individuals and families, and approximately $95 million will be distributed to community projects in bushfire affected areas. On the one hand this has been a huge fund-raising exercise where the generosity of Australians all around this country has been on display, but it is now about ensuring that their generosity is able to be tapped into for the longer term reconstruction and benefit of the communities that are affected. In closing I take this opportunity to acknowledge the Caring Hearts Community Quilters in my electorate who, through their own labour, provided a number of quilts to individuals that were affected by the bushfires. They did a great job. They are a wonderful bunch of ladies. I MAIN COMMITTEE visited them recently and I know they will continue to do good work in our community. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Ms George) adjourned. Sitting suspended from 12.52 pm to 4.03 pm Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts Committee Report Debate resumed from 26 October, on motion by Ms George: That the House take note of the report. Dr WASHER (Moore) (4.04 pm)-I rise to speak on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts called Managing our coastal zone in a changing climate: the time to act is now. This is an important report with significant national impact. The key message which emerged from this inquiry is that the issue is very significant and worrying, resulting in a need for national leadership to manage Australia’s coastal zone in the context of climate change. The committee has considered the issues in great detail and the 47 recommendations focus on the provision of national leadership in collaboration with state and local governments and on engaging local communities in this initiative. A large percentage-in fact, some 80 per cent-of Australians live in the coastal areas, and this concentration of population with its attendant infrastructure makes us particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. There is a new urgency in improving the management of our coastal zones, and it is time to act now. There is strong scientific consensus that climate change is leading to rising sea levels and extreme climatic events. There is no question that rising sea levels will result in increases in flooding associated with high tides, storms and heavy rainfall. We need to alert coastal communities to the coming challenges and ensure that they are fully engaged in addressing them. Some of the key recommendations of the report address the need for nationally-consistent planning guidelines; increased research on sea level rise and extreme sea level advance; improved emergency management, including the establishment of a coastal natural disaster mitigation program; and the integration of the surf-lifesaving network into early warning systems. There are many issues that will need consideration: building codes, insurance matters and a comprehensive national assessment of the vulnerability of coastal infrastructure. We need to take account of the large numbers of Australians who holiday in coastal areas, putting pressure on local services and infrastructure. The Australian Bureau of Statistics could provide accurate data on the numbers and impacts of tourists in order to enable better matching of resources with demand for infrastructure and services. The committee has also recommended that the Australian government develop a coastal sustainability charter as part of a new intergovernmental agreement on the coastal zone to be managed through COAG. I thank all the committee members for their hard work and their bipartisan support on this important national issue. I especially thank the chair, the member for Throsby-who is a good friend of mine and did a great job-and all the members that served on the committee who were there from the beginning to the end. The staff, and especially the secretary, are to be MAIN COMMITTEE commended on their excellent work in producing this important report. I particularly thank Dr Kate Sullivan for her work in leading the inquiry and also Julia. There is great interest in this issue in the community at large. The number of written submissions and presentations by witnesses to address the terms of reference, together with the committee hearings around Australia, have resulted in a report which makes a significant contribution to the national debate. We need to work collaboratively to address the problems associated with climate change and their impact on our coastal communities. Although some of the committee members-and especially myself, because I have had a grizzle in the past-say that governments traditionally ignore committee reports, this one was not ignored, and that is terrific. Moore, who has worked so hard and so constructively across party lines on this report. A report can only be so important when it has that bipartisan support. If that does not happen, then the report is usually consigned to the dustbins of this parliament. The member for Moore worked very hard with the member for Throsby to make this report unanimous, and I think that is very important. It is also an honour to be speaking before the member for Lyons, who in parliament today asked a question on this report. I know that he has a deep concern about the effects of climate change on coastal New South Wales. He has his seat several seats above me, but we both share the same coast and many of the same problems. I made two submissions to this inquiry. I was privileged to have the committee come and visit the seat of Dobell and the Central Coast. In fact, it was the first visit it made in relation to looking at how climate change affects the coast of Australia. That is an important thing, because the electorate of Dobell is greatly affected by climate change. It is a beautiful place, probably the most beautiful place in Australia, but unfortunately the environment is very fragile. We have a thin coastline with developments there. In the middle of the electorate there is a beautiful lake which is prone to flooding as it has access to the sea. An issue such as rising sea levels affects everyone on the Central Coast, particularly those in my electorate. The report is also important because it creates national awareness of how climate change affects the places in which we live. We are engaged in a debate on this in the main chamber in which often the contributions are theoretical, with members talking about particular models, and very partisan in their approach. But this inquiry actually went out and visited places and in its report we find real people and real effects on real communities, so that is something else that this inquiry should be commended for. That is so important because it puts a human face on what is happening with climate change. It recognises the very real risks and threats to the areas of population on our coastlines which come from rising sea levels and storm events. Also, it pulls no punches about what needs to be done to tackle the issues. While they were in my region the committee members heard that not too long before they visited there had been a major storm event which had caused extensive flooding across the region and serious erosion of the backyards of many oceanfront homes. They saw first hand some of the erosion. In my second submission I was able to show the committee images of a subsequent storm event, which I will talk about shortly. The standing committee’s report has a large list of recommendations. There are in fact 47, covering the sorts of measures that we as a nation need to take to counter the major issues facing coastal communities. The overriding message is that we must act now, not later down the track but immediately. That is what this MAIN COMMITTEE",264,Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill No 2 2009
241,Mr Craig Thomson (Dobell) (4.08 Pm),"It is an honour to follow the member forgovernment is doing: acting now. We are acting on the wider issue of climate change, yet there are still those opposite who are living in denial. When I walked along the beach at North Entrance earlier this year, inspecting the damage done by a major storm, the sorts of hazards that many of my constituents face by living so close to the ocean hit home for me. A whole street of homes had lost large chunks of their backyards. There were bits of fence overhanging the yards, concrete pathways sticking out, broken rails and trees uprooted along the fence lines. In the backyard of one of these houses a beautiful glass fence had been completely washed away. The residents had lost over four metres of their backyard because of this storm surge. Details of that particular storm surge were part of the supplementary submission that I made to the standing committee whose report I am referring to now. This report is comprehensive and covers most of the country’s coastline. The recommendations are far-reaching and extensive as to what we must do to tackle the many issues facing coastal communities. Given that there are 47 recommendations, I will look at some of them as there is not enough time to go through all of them. AlthoughI know the member for Fadden is riveted and wants me to go into greater detail, nevertheless I will restrict myself to just a few. Recommendation 2 states: The Committee notes the importance of mitigation measures in addressing climate change impacts and accordingly recommends that the Australian Government continue to take urgent action to ensure that Australia can best contribute to a reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions. That is what we are doing. I am among many members who have been involved today in the debate on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation in the House. It is time that the opposition supported this legislation. Time has run out, excuses have run out and we need to act on our climate-and this particular report recognises that. Another recommendation is: … the Australian Government increase its investment in coastal based climate change research on: sea level rise projections and the dynamics of polar ice sheets, particularly in the Antarctic extreme sea level events, including as a result of storm surge and tropical cyclones regional variations in sea level riseand the effects that changes in the oceans will have on Australia’s coral reefs particularly in relation tohigher ocean temperatures and changing ocean currents It was great to see recommendation 5 of the committee, namely, that the Department of Climate Change continue to fund research on such topics as establishing the wave climate around the coast so as to identify locations most at risk from wave erosion. Proper research is essential, especially in places in my electorate such as the North Entrance which on two occasions in the last few years have been greatly eroded by storm surges. Another positive recommendation is that the federal government continue funding under the Climate Change Adaptation Skills for Professionals Program. It was also recommended the Australian government liaise with tertiary institutions to ensure an adequate supply of appropriately skilled coastal planners and engineers. Recommendation 9 reads: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government establish a coastal zone research network within the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility and that it complete a coastal zone research plan. MAIN COMMITTEE The committee also recommended the Australian government establish a national coastal zone database to improve access to and consistency of information relevant to coastal zone adaptation. I have been calling for better cooperation between councils and state government and federal government departments and agencies in tackling the issues associated with climate change for some time and in particular in this place on a number of occasions. I am glad to see the committee has recommended that this take place and that the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government undertake a study into the human and resourcing needs of local governments to effectively plan for and adapt to the impacts of climate change. I have also spoken frequently about disaster mitigation, especially since the June 2007 long weekend on the Central Coast which caused widespread flooding and damage and over a thousand people to be evacuated. The report states in recommendation14: To further enhance Australia’s disaster mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery arrangements in the event of possible major coastal disasters, the Committee recommends that the Australian Government establish a grants program, the Coastal National Disaster Mitigation Program, to fund natural disaster mitigation projects in the Australian coastal zone. The Committee also recommends that the Australian Emergency Management Committee … consider the following issues: improved data on coastal disaster risk assessment and vulnerable coastal sites improved access and evacuation routes for coastal communities; improved coastal community awareness of and resilience to natural disasters improved coordination of coastal disaster mitigation arrangements with other initiatives currently underway, such as reviews of the Australian Building Code and land use planning policies to take into account climate change impacts. These are all important recommendations. The surf lifesaving community on the Central Coast is a very strong community and it was good to see that the committee has made recommendations in relation to the role of surf lifesaving in the use of their network into emergency services preparedness, planning, and response systems and activities. I know that the good members who run Surf Lifesaving Central Coast, particularly Chad Griffith, who is the CEO there, will welcome this particular recommendation. On the issue of insurance, the committee has recommended that the Australian government request the Productivity Commission to undertake an inquiry into the projected impacts of climate change and related insurance matters. Some of the focuses of this recommendation are: insurance coverage of coastal properties, given the concentration of Australia’s population and infrastructure along the coast estimates of the value of properties potentially exposed to this risk insurance affordability, availability and uptake existing and emerging gaps in insurance coverage, with a particular focus on coverage of coastal risks such as storm surge/inundation, landslip/erosion and sea level rise … This is a very important thing for people who have properties by the sea and it needs to be addressed by the government. In the seat of Dobell there are three areas in particular that have MAIN COMMITTEE been hard hit by storm surges. The beach at Wamberal has been washed away on a number of occasions, as have the beaches at North Entrance. These beaches have extensive development on them. The beach at the little cove at Cabbage Tree Bay, Norah Head, has been closed for over 18 months now because there are houses on the cliff tops that are literally falling into the bay as erosion has occurred due to storm surges. My electorate bears the full brunt of these storm surges on the coast, but it also bears the brunt of storm surges that come up through The Entrance and enter the Tuggerah Lakes system which, in 2007, caused extensive flooding inland around the lake where most of the population in my electorate lives. That resulted in over a thousand people having to be evacuated and moved and a massive coordination effort. This report makes many recommendations in relation to our being prepared. It makes many recommendations in relation to action that we need to take to mitigate these natural disasters. It makes many recommendations as to why we need to act on climate change. This is a very important report that brings home to everyone who lives on the coast the need to act. We cannot put our heads in the sand and hope that this issue goes away. It is affecting our community now. The report should be commended and the recommendations should be endorsed. noted. In calling the honourable member for Lyne, I would also like to welcome his daughter Olivia to the public gallery of the Main Committee. family-friendly conditions. I, like the previous speaker, live on the coast. In raising a question in question time this afternoon I had to put up with some ribbing from colleagues because I did not declare an interest-so I will now. I do live on the beach. It is the classic Storm Boy house. I will be directly affected if the three tiers of government do not address this issue and address it soon. I believe this report, Managing our coastal zone in a changing climate, is a seminal report for coastline management in Australia today. I congratulate the members for Throsby and Moore and all the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts. I think this is an outstanding start to the hard work that has to be done by the three tiers of government. On the mid-North Coast of New South Wales there are two standout locations that are currently under threat: the Lake Cattai community in the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council area and the Old Bar community in the Greater Taree City Council area. I was very pleased that the committee agreed to meet with residents from the Old Bar community and to see in the final report the evidence of one particular resident, Mr Ross Keys, being used as an example of the issues at stake. I am very thankful to the member for Throsby, in particular, for doing that. That example is a demonstration of how real this issue is and how time sensitive it is. I have heard comments over the last 48 hours that imply that coastal erosion and sea level rises are issues for 100 years away. They are not. They are here, they are now and they need to be addressed through a coordinated approach from the three tiers of government, led by the Commonwealth, which is indicated in the recommendations of this report. That is what makes it so seminal. Now it needs to be taken up by the executive and given a full and adequate response. The example of Mr Keys, for those who are not aware and have not read the report, is one that should ring alarm bells for all of us. He has been given demolition orders on two properties. He could rebuild at the furthest end of his property, away from the beach, but he has basically lost two houses to the ocean. He was blind-sided by another issue-the global finanMAIN COMMITTEE",269,Committees

243,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (4.20 Pm),"Thank you to all in this place for demonstratingcial crisis-which meant he had a great deal of trouble refinancing to do the rebuild. Here is a bloke living on the coast in Old Bar who has been hit by two significant global issues in the last 18 months. That is a real, timely example of the importance of government tackling this issue and starting to address it. I am very pleased with this report. I now ask all members in this place to move into the next stage, which is to get government to respond to these recommendations and respond in full. That was the exact reason I raised the question in question time this afternoon about how many of these 47 recommendations government is going to take up. I urge all members in this debate not only to talk about the wonderful work that has been done on this document but to now start to put the blowtorch on the executive to turn those 47 recommendations into reality in a full response from government. It would be a travesty if these recommendations sit on a shelf as we see, sadly too often, in the good committee work that is being done in this parliament. SoI urge the Prime Minister, the relevant ministers and the executive generally to take up these 47 recommendations-the heavy lifting has in many ways been done-and use the report as an actionable document to start to coordinate the three tiers of government and answer some of the difficult questions around private title and public lands along the coast. The issue that the report identifies as being raised most frequently and most outstanding is legal liability along the coast. It is a difficult question to answer on the ‘buyer beware’ principle regarding private title and whether taxpayers’ money should be used to assist and compensate those who arguably should have been fully aware of what they were purchasing and the implications of the purchase. I am luke warm on that, and therefore the ALRC recommendation is important. What gets me across the line, however-and this should hopefully get the taxpayers of Australia across the line-is the loss of public lands. There are some beautiful public lands along our coastline that have been protected through many hard fights in many locations and in many communities. It would be incredibly sad to see those public lands lost through no action from government or through the inability of local councils to adequately resource and protect those lands. The fact that the Commonwealth has come in hard through this committee process is outstanding. The challenge now is for the executive to respond. I would strongly urge that, not only in the interests of the members for Throsby and Moore and all involved in this work but, more importantly, in the interests of the communities along the coastlines of Australia that are affected-in my electorate they are the communities of Old Bar and Lake Cattai, who are directly affected now-the executive responds as quickly and as thoroughly as possible. I would hope we are going to have a response with the full take-up of the 47 recommendations and with the government actioning that uptake as quickly as possible-preferably, in my view, before the end of the year. That is the challenge for all of us: push government across the line to do that. I hope everyone puts their shoulder to the wheel to do that, because I think we have a pretty good starting point with the work that has been done already by the committee. Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts, Managing our coastal zone in a changing climate: the time to act is now.

In fact, all members, including my colleague the member for Fowler, worked very hard in the true spirit of bipartisanship. The subject of the committee’s inquiry concerns all of us. I pay tribute to the committee secretariat for doing such an excellent job. No-one could have asked for a better inquiry secretary than Dr Kate Sullivan, who is a true professional. So, too, is our committee secretary, Ms Julia Morris, as well as research officers Ms Sophie Nicolle and Ms Adrienne Batts, and administrative officers Ms Kane Moir and Ms Jazmine Rakic. I thank all of them for doing such an excellent job. As you know, we were charged with inquiring into issues related to climate change and environmental pressures experienced by the Australian coastal areas, particularly in the context of coastal population growth, having regard to: existing policies and programs related to coastal zone management, taking in the catchment-coastocean continuum the environmental impacts of coastal population growth and mechanisms to promote sustainable use of coastal resources the impact of climate change on coastal areas and strategies to deal with climate change adaptation, particularly in response to projected sea level rise mechanisms to promote sustainable coastal communities governance and institutional arrangements for the coastal zone. You can see the breadth of the terms of reference. The committee did such a good job over 18 months. It is noteworthy that there were more than 100 written submissions and something like 180 exhibits in this inquiry. In the public hearings that I have participated in since I became a member of this committee I have been truly impressed with the sincerity of all the witnesses, who clearly understood the issues and challenges that face us as a nation in addressing climate change. It is true that national leadership, as the chair of the committee, Ms George, has pointed out, is required to address climate change, and that is why the Rudd government, as we speak, is anxious to get the CPRS legislation through the parliament before the Copenhagen conference in December. This is indeed a great report. I like to refer to it as the George report because the chair of the committee put her stamp on itMrs Irwin-Hear, hear! can look at the tremendous media interest that has been generated following the tabling of this report on Monday evening.

This is fantastic media coverage and will go a long way to educating the public. It does not stop there. I have to give credit to News Ltd. On page 1 of the AustralianMrs Irwin-There are more? Fraser starts off by sending a very powerful message across Australia: A Federal parliamentary report has flagged new powers that would allow Canberra to block what it sees as inappropriate beachfront developments. You have only to look at the photo in this newspaper to get some idea, as in the Fairfax press, how serious this is. It goes on to say: The report, tabled yesterday in parliament, says national guidelines should be drawn up for development in sensitive coastal regions, and calls for local councils to operate within these guidelines. It goes on and on. There is some very good reading there too. It does not stop there. I have to give the Canberra Times a commercial, too, because they pick up on the title of our report-”‘Time to act is now’ on coastal climate risks”. David McLennan gives a very comprehensive report into the report of the committee. This report is quite something. IfI go to the substance of the report, which is contained in the recommendations-and there are some 47 of them-you will get some idea of the extent and breadth of this report and why it is important to act now. The recommendations are calling on the Australian government to: … commission a study on international coastal zone governance arrangements, policies and programs for addressing coastal climate change impacts, and adaptation strategies. The completed study should be made public. I could not agree more with that. At recommendation 2: The Committee notes the importance of mitigation measures in addressing climate change impacts and accordingly recommends that the Australian Government continue to take urgent action to ensure that Australia can best contribute to a reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions. I must applaud Dr Mal Washer, the member for Moore, who has really put his back into this report in getting a message through to our political opponents.

The committee’s recommendations go on to make it clear that the government has to increase its investment in coastal based climate change research. Recommendation 4 states: The Committee recommends that the coastal zone component of the National Climate Change Science Framework and proposed National Climate Change Science strategy be clearly identified by the proposed high level coordination group and involve key coastal stakeholders. In recommendation 5 the committee goes on to recommend that the Department of Climate Change continue to fund research, which is so important, to establish the wave climate around the coasts so as to identify those locations most at risk from wave erosion and to examine how the wave climate nationally interacts with the varying landform types. The committee recommends at recommendation 6: … that the Australian Government continue funding under the Climate Change Adaptation Skills for Professionals Program. In addition, the Australian Government should liaise with tertiary institutions to ensure an adequate supply of appropriately skilled coastal planners and engineers. The committee recommends that the government establish a coastal zone research network with the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, and that it complete a coastal zone research plan. Further, the committee recommended that the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government: … undertake a study into the human and resourcing needs of local governments to effectively plan for and adapt to the impacts of climate change. And that: this study be carried out in conjunction with the Australian Local Government Association and the National Sea Change Taskforce. This is terribly important. I do not really think that the local governments around our country understand the magnitude and the implications for them. At recommendation 11, the committee recommends: … that the Australian Government establish a National Coastal Zone Database to improve access to and consistency of information relevant to coastal zone adaptation. The report goes on with further very important recommendations. At recommendation 17: The Committee recommends that the Department of Climate Change, in collaboration with the Queensland Government, CSIRO and Indigenous communities in the Torres Strait, undertake a major study into the vulnerability of the Torres Strait to the impacts of climate change and provide assistance in the development of an adaptation plan. The committee, at recommendation 19, further recommends: that the Australian Government request the Productivity Commission to undertake an inquiry into the projected impacts of climate change and related insurance matters, with a particular focus on: and this is terribly importantinsurance coverage of coastal properties, given the concentration of Australia’s population and infrastructure along the coast estimates of the value of properties potentially exposed to this risk insurance affordability, availability and uptake existing and emerging gaps in insurance coverage … MAIN COMMITTEE the need for a clear definition of the circumstances under which an insurance claim is payable due to storm surge/inundation, landslip/erosion and sea level rise, as well as due to permanent submersion of some or all of the land … This is a very substantial recommendation, and the Productivity Commission will certainly have its work cut out dealing with all that. There is a further recommendation that requires the Building Code of Australia to employ cyclone building codes and revise them with the objective of increasing resilience to climate change. The report further states: Noting the gap in research on legal issues and climate change impacts on the coastal zone, the Committee recommends that the Australian Government request that the Australian Law Reform Commission undertake an urgent inquiry into this area, with particular focus on the clarification of liability issues. And it goes on. Recommendation 26 states: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government: expand the list of national priority areas identified under the Caring for our Country program to include climate change impacts on biodiversity Recommendation 29 recommends that the Australian government: continue working with the Queensland Government and local councils under the existing Great Barrier Reef Intergovernmental Agreement to improve land use planning in the catchment And further, very importantly: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government urgently commission a detailed climate change vulnerability assessment for Kakadu National Park, in consultation with the park’s traditional owners and other stakeholders and drawing on the results of the ‘first pass’ National Coastal Vulnerability Assessment of the park. Importantly, the committee recommends that the government: … work through the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council and in consultation with Birds Australia and other stakeholders to implement a National Shorebirds Protection Strategy. And further, that the government also: … work with the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council and other stakeholders to develop an action plan to: ensure that coastal buffers, coastal habitat corridors and high ecological value areas are identified and included in Commonwealth, state and local government management processes Time, the enemy, is going to beat me here. But I encourage anyone who is taking an interest in this to go through the whole 47 recommendations, because they are ample testament to how serious and important this issue is.

252,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (4.43 Pm),"I follow the member for Lowe in this debate on theme. So for people who are listening or who are interested in reading about the recommendations, the member for Lowe has done us all a service, and I thank him for that. I hope to shed some light on some of the recommendations. But, first of all, I commend the committee for its work. I had the good fortune of chairing this committee in an earlier incarnation and I recognise the bipartisan approach that was embraced by the members on the committee, particularly those who have now been elevated. The member for Throsby and I shared many a committee hearing and inquiry where we looked at things including sustainable cities; how we embed sustainability in our way of life, in business, in commerce; and how we provide reliable information for consumers and the business community to make wise purchases. Many good hours of work went into some very meaningful recommendations. What does not always happen, though, is the action that should flow from these committee reports. This report highlights earlier inquiries along the same lines essentially coming to a very similar conclusion-that is, the need for coordination, cooperation and collaboration between levels of government and government agencies, and taking a more strategic approach to the management and care of this very important part of our continent and landscape, the zones where we live where there is a lot commerce and lot of agriculture. That is a consistent theme running through the House of Representatives standing committee reports Management of the Australian coastal zone in 1980 and The injured coastline: protection of the coastal environment in 1991, and the 1993 report from the Resource Assessment Commission, Coastal zone inquiry: final report. It was not until the Howard government was elected in 1996 that we had a coordinated approach to coastal management. I know it well; I helped prepare the provision of the Coasts and Clean Seas initiative that sought to highlight the pressures on our coastline. That was born in large part out of my own experience on the Mornington Peninsula, where we are often concerned that the coastline is loved to within an inch of its life and could be loved to death. A lot of work has gone on through very many committed community organisations and the local council to revegetate, restore and rehabilitate the coastal area. The biggest threat to the coast is often its own popularity. In the community that I represent we are host to the largest remnant coastal vegetation in greater Melbourne-that strip line from Eel Race Road, running all the way down to Long Island, an area which is largely the Seaford foreshore. It is very precious and very important, and it is well recognised as a priority within our community. Embracing the best that all of us have to offer is the essence of this report. This report adds another pressure to act, and that is the impact of climate change. It comes as no surprise that some of the remarks are perhaps a little less gracious than they could be in the climate change debate currently going on in the parliament and what action we can take-and that has relevance to this report. The report recognises that inundation, the risk of rising sea levels, the viciousness of storm events and sea surges-not to mention where they may combine into a horrific cacophony of devastation-have an awful impact on coastal areas. Some of the locations that have been identified as being at risk include yours, Mr Deputy Speaker Slipper, and my own, the Mornington Peninsula. We need to make sure, though, that this is not just a bolt-on body of work-which, sadly, we see too often with the Rudd government. We are having a debate at the moment about cities policy. Those who have been here for any length of time would know that I have been all over that like a fat kid on a Smartie, if I can put it that way, for some time. I instigated and led MAIN COMMITTEE the sustainable cities work, where again the emphasis was on inculcating this thinking into all the systems and decision making of government, not just bolting it on as an afterthought or as a feature piece. This is the concern that I have with many of the population pressure policy approaches, let us call them, of the current government, and the worry I have here. You could set up an agency and have a very visible post-it note response to this challenge but see very little change in the way decisions are made. That is the risk. This report, like the ones before it, says that kind of approach would be tokenistic and largely ineffective, and what is needed is a more coordinated, collaborative and integrated approach, a strategic approach that involves agencies and institutions, all levels of government and individual citizens in a way that sees a process of change and action rather than the odd event here and there that might be good press but does not actually address the challenges that this report outlines. That is the risk-that this good body of work will just be picked up and dealt with like safety was 20 or 30 years ago, where you would go into some companies and they would say, ‘Safety’s important to us; we’ve got a safety officer.’ That was dragged out there as a very visible demonstration of their interest. We have all learnt that that is not how it works, that safety is everybody’s business, and we have seen the changes that resulted from that awakening. This is the same thing here. We can have a very visible agency or effort that orbits everything else that goes on within government and not actually see any change to the day-to-day management and operation of the government, of the allocation of resources, of how investments funded by the taxpayer are chosen and implemented and of the support that is needed for private citizens when they making their contribution. The other risk we have is that we may convince the Australian public that doing one thing will fix this problem. I fear that with some of the debate on the ETS-or the CPRS, as it is termed by this government-it is thought that somehow the government getting what it wants will resolve this problem. That extraordinarily simplistic and misguided message is not one we should be putting out into the community, because it basically relieves everybody of the contribution they need to make because of the belief that somehow this economic instrument that provides for the trading of emissions permits in a cap-and-trade system will solve this problem. I was concerned that my friend and neighbour the member for Isaacs, Mr Dreyfus, with whom I often share a podium at citizenship ceremonies, offered a doorstop contribution yesterday where he was asked the question: How much would a five per cent reduction in emissions by 2020 reduce sea levels? He was on good ground to start with. He said: We have to start now. We have to get on with the job of reducing emissions. I do not disagree with anything so far. But then he was pressed further: How much would a five per cent reduction reduce sea levels? It was not ‘relieve the increase in sea levels’; it was, ‘How much would a five per cent reduction reduce sea levels?’ My friend and colleague the member for Isaacs said: It will reduce sea levels. So a five per cent reduction in Australia under the CPRS will reduce sea levels around the globe! Why wouldn’t you want a piece of that? But what utter nonsense! A five per cent reMAIN COMMITTEE duction in Australians’ emissions will have a microscopic impact on the increase of sea level. How on earth it will reduce sea levels is beyond me. I respect the member for Isaacs. He has been a part of this inquiry, but he must have had a brain-fade at that point to claim that a five per cent reduction under the CPRS will actually reduce sea levels. The questioner thought that was amusing, because the questioner went on and said: Do you know by how much? Rather than quit while he was behind, the member for Isaacs went further and said: There’s a range within which it will reduce sea levels and doing it down to the millimetre in fact is not possible. The questioner said: Will it be a couple of millimetres? On it went about what the reduction will be. It is unfortunate that some are taking that message out to the community. say that a five per cent reduction from a CPRS in Australia is going to reduce global sea levels, in an act of biblical proportions, is something that he may well regret. I hope he clarifies that remark when he gets to speak on this report later. My point is, though, that there is no single action that will bring about the improved resilience and sustainability of our coastal environments, that there are challenges we face and that there is no silver bullet that will address that-certainly not a five per cent CPRS reduction. The other thing that needs to be recognised is that there are some challenges that need to be worked on further, and there are a number of recommendations that call for further reviews and further work. Some comments have pointed to local government not knowing quite what is going on, and I am pleased that, at least in the communities that I represent, there is a high level of alertness around this topic among the municipal councils that I am involved with. In fact, in other areas throughout Victoria, particularly in Gippsland and the like, they are quite activated by it. Individuals are seeing development opportunities denied them because of concerns about rising sea levels. My friend Greg Sugars, the Chief Executive of Opteon Property Group, which is Australia’s largest independent property valuer, has released a statement in response to this report being released, and he quite rightly points to the fact that in the commercial area, particularly if the recommendation about insurance schemes led by the Commonwealth and other areas of what I would call foggy law are addressed, there is a real need to engage the professions. Even if you had a nationally inspired insurance scheme, how you would value and price the risk to have policies available and then price the harm or damage that might activate a claim against those policies is very uncharted territory. Mr Sugars points out that his company and his alliance of property valuers around Australia do nearly a quarter of a million valuations per year for mortgage lenders. That valuation and the certainty that it provides gives comfort to lenders in offering finance, as mortgages, to homebuyers. Those clients will be watching very closely to see what happens to the value of properties and what impact that will have on the ability to attract finance in coastal areas.

254,Mr Billson,"He is a very intelligent man who I have some time and respect for, but toOne of the key issues will be to provide accurate advice on values of the potentially affected properties, especially if the government looks at a compulsory land insurance scheme. Valuers will also need to familiarise themselves with any changing planning implications and carefully assess any future insurance considerations when undertaking replacement cost exercises. In some cases a recommendation is that replacement not proceed where there is a high degree of vulnerability as assessed by some of the tools that are recommended in this report. In closing, I welcome this report and found it a really interesting read, capturing a number of issues that emphasise the need for sustained, coordinated, collaborative action. There is no single solution to remedy these concerns. I have great admiration for the committee and the members that generated the report. I had the good fortune of working with them over a number of years and I recognise the diligence with which they go about their work. My last point is, though, that this is something that needs hard work and rigour, not headlines and statements of political rhetoric. It actually needs someone to put their shoulder to the wheel. I am confident that the coalition is very interested in this. As part of our broader strategy to improve the sustainability of our economy and of the built environment, this is very valuable input. I congratulate the committee for its work and look forward to the government’s response, whenever that might be forthcoming. out by any analysis of the spread of our population. As the report notes, 80 per cent of Australians live in the coastal zones around the country, with over 700,000 living close to the sea and less than six metres above sea level. Protecting Australia’s coastal zone in a changing environment is indeed one of the greatest challenges facing our nation. As the report states on its titlepage, the time to act is now. This report makes the case for urgent action and details the first steps to be taken for us to begin to appreciate the full extent of the risks faced by those Australians living in coastal communities and a great many of the 16 million Australians living around our coastline. A feature of the recommendations in this report is the number which call for further research and data gathering. In looking at the impact of climate change on our coast, there is one thing we know for certain-that is, we need to know a lot more about the factors which can impact on our coastal areas. So it is not surprising to see that from recommendation 1, which calls for a study of coastal zone governance arrangements for addressing coastal climate change impact and adaptation strategies, the major emphasis of this report is on the need for further research. Recommendation 3 calls on the government to increase its investment in coastal based climate change research. Recommendation 5 calls for continued funding for wave climate research. Recommendation 9 calls on the government to establish a coastal zone research network. Recommendation 10 calls for a study of human and resource needs for local government to plan for and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Recommendation 11 calls on the government to set up a national coastal zone database. Recommendation 12 calls for further national coastal vulnerability assessments. Recommendation 13 calls for research into the relationship between climate change and disease. Please be assured I will not go through all 47 recommendations. Recommendation 16 calls for a comprehensive national assessment of coastal infrastructure vulnerability to inundation from sea level rise and extreme sea level events. Recommendation 18 calls for a major study into the vulnerability of the Torres Strait Islands. RecomMAIN COMMITTEE",280,Committees
255,Mrs Irwin (Fowler) (4.57 Pm),"The preference of Australians for coastal living is bornemendation 19 calls for a Productivity Commission inquiry into insurance of coastal properties. Recommendation 25 calls for the Australian Bureau of Statistics to measure the numbers of tourist demographic changes in coastal communities. Recommendation 30 calls for an urgent detailed climate change vulnerability assessment for Kakadu National Park. Recommendation 35 calls for a national repository identifying Indigenous and non-Indigenous heritage sites in vulnerable coastal areas, and recommendation 42 calls for the expansion of the national coastal zone interface. So it can be seen that this report sensibly raises more questions than it answers. The calls for research and ongoing monitoring are the key to a focused approach to planning to adapt and deal with the impact of climate change on the coast. Those further recommendations seeking to prepare management plans can only be successful if the research groundwork has been done. We cannot afford to get it wrong when it comes to planning and implementing our response to the coastal impacts of climate change. So the research called for in this report is urgent and vital as it will form the basis for our strategies to deal with the inevitable change to our coast and its impact on the great proportion of our population. When we look at the key coastal issues, we can see the danger of merely looking at the overall picture. We can agree with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimate of a global sea rise of 80 centimetres by 2100, but this must be interpreted in the light of local research. We know that we can expect major impacts and, as much as we can, set them out, as has been done in the 2007 national climate change and adaptation framework, which is quoted in the report as follows: The coastal zone is vulnerable to sea level rise, increased sea surface temperature, increased storm intensity and frequency, ocean acidification and changes to rainfall, run-off, wave size and direction and ocean currents. The combined influence of sea level rise, storm surge and storm events, including cyclones, may pose severe localised threats and result in damage from shoreline erosion, saltwater inundation, flooding and hyper-velocity winds. Increasing sea surface temperatures can lead to the spread of marine pests and changes in fish stock and bleaching of coral reefs. That is a prediction that makes the biblical plagues of Egypt sound mild in comparison. In the face of such predictions, you would expect the warning to go out for everyone to head for the hills. But we cannot expect our love for coastal living to be easily dampened. Indeed, we may even expect that the trend to coastal living will increase. And that makes it essential for governments at all levels to plan for the impact of climate change on our coastal areas. The first step in that planning process is, of course, to have access to the most detailed research data. We cannot rely on vague predictions; we need hard data and expert analysis if we are to address the challenges posed by climate change. That is why the emphasis in this report is on that research. As the committee found in its visits across Australia, in some areas we are already facing the consequences of rising sea levels and storm events. The most serious of these can be seen in the Torres Strait Islands and it is not hard to see the potential impact on such areas as Kakadu National Park. Closer to home storm erosion on the New South Wales Central Coast has exposed more than unstable shores. The legal consequences and liabilities of individuals and governments require urgent clarification as we can expect more widespread events to cause havoc in coastal communities. Faced with population pressure on our coastal areas, the planning process at all levels of govMAIN COMMITTEE ernment will be greatly strained. Given the greater research data that this report calls for, we should expect a greater appreciation of the stress placed on coastal areas by development. There can be no argument for allowing inappropriate development in areas at risk from the impacts of climate change. It will be hard enough dealing with the costly and disputed consequences of climate change events on existing private properties and public assets. This is a landmark report. It places the issue of the impact of climate change on Australia’s coastal zones squarely on the agenda and it makes it plain that the time to act is now. I must add that it has been a privilege to serve as a member of the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts during the course of such an important inquiry. This afternoon, I do wish to pay tribute to a woman who I admire greatly, the committee chair, the member for Throsby, Jennie George. I know that this is an issue close to her heart and one that she has a passion for. As opposition parliamentary secretary with responsibility for coastal development in the previous parliament, the member for Throsby definitely did the lion’s share of the groundwork for Labor’s policy. From this background she has grasped the opportunity to place the issue of the coastal impact of climate change on the national agenda and I know she will continue to press for the implementation of the recommendations contained in this report. She is a very strong woman as you know, Deputy Speaker Moylan. I will be pleased to give her my full support in that endeavour. I thank Dr Mal Washer, the member for Moore and the deputy chair, and all committee members for this outstanding bipartisan report. I would also add my thanks to the committee secretariat, especially Dr Kate Sullivan who has been with the committee from the start-you have done an excellent job, Kate, and deserve the congratulations of all committee members. A report on a subject of this complexity demands an understanding of the issues as well as the ability to put the issues into a perspective which backs its recommendations with sound arguments. In the course of this inquiry the committee has taken submissions from a whole range of people involved with or affected by the impact of climate change. Some were distinguished experts in their field who presented a clear case for action by government. Others were ordinary Australians with the foresight and concern for the environment to passionately put their case. Some are already working on solutions while others have done much to improve community awareness and I offer congratulations to all of them. Throughout the community as well as the committee there exists the awareness and commitment to take action on the impact of climate change on Australia’s coastal zone. The ball is now in the government’s court and again, as the subtitle of this wonderful report states, the time to act is now. I have elected to speak on this report today because of the direct relevance it has to my electorate of Canning. Evidence was taken from the City of Mandurah, which has a fragile coastline and extensive low-lying waterways, and also the Shire of Waroona, which has coastline as well as very fragile lakes and world heritage listed Ramsar wetlands. As has already been said by many, this report-Managing our coastal zone in a changing climate: the time to act is now-looks at better ways to manage our coastal zone and makes a series of recommendations designed to help future-proof our coastal communities. This is very relevant to the area that I have already described. Importantly, many of the committee’s recommendations look at how the three tiers of government-federal, state and local-can work together to come up with viable solutions to MAIN COMMITTEE",281,Committees
256,Mr Randall (Canning) (5.09 Pm),"Even though I was not a member of the committee,these long-term planning issues. Australia is a country that is primarily built around its coast, with 80 per cent of our population living in what is classified as the coastal zone. In Western Australia, much of our coastal housing and infrastructure is at risk of storm surge and other severe weather events as our coast changes over time. According to Department of Climate Change figures, up to 94,000 buildings may be affected, coastal flooding may increase and beach erosion will continue, not to mention the impact that climate change may have on other infrastructure, such as road and rail. During the inquiry, the committee visited Mandurah in the electorate of Canning and toured the coastal suburbs of Silver Sands, Halls Head and Falcon, amongst others. Mandurah has the highest growth rate of any regional city in Australia, with an anticipated annual growth of 3.39 per cent. The population is expected to grow to almost 100,000 by 2021. The city of Mandurah has a strong record of environmental protection and addressing climate change. In 1999, Mandurah joined the Cities for Climate Protection. In 2000, it set a target to reduce corporate and community greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2010. In 2001, the city hosted the 1st Western Australian Coastal Conference. In 2008, it announced that it would undertake an assessment, which was completed in 2009, of the potential risk to Mandurah’s coastal zone. As you can see, Mandurah has certainly been involved in this issue, which is quite relevant to that city. The Mayor, Paddi Creevey, who I congratulate on her re-election in the council elections a couple of weeks ago, and her CEO, Mark Newman, should be commended on their commitment to productivity. They have enhanced disaster mitigation preparedness and response plans for the possible event of future coastal natural disasters. I understand from reading the report and the council’s submission that the committee met with representatives of the City of Mandurah to discuss the impact that changes to our coastline will have on urban development and planning in the future. Over time many suburbs in Mandurah will be affected particularly those along the coast, around the canal developments and the near estuary. Limited flooding of the foreshore already occurs in Mandurah when higher tides coincide with storm surges. A long-term rise in sea levels may also cause further beach erosion, particularly in suburbs like Silver Sands, from which I have had a number of representations over the years and where the beach has noticeably reduced over the past few decades. As I mentioned earlier, the City of Mandurah has already looked into many of these issues through its study, which identified and prioritised the risks for Mandurah’s coastal zones and waterways, in turn allowing the city to create contingency management plans through its climate change adaptation plan. The committee noted in particular the impact that rising sea levels will have on the extensive canal developments in several suburbs in Mandurah, including Wannanup and Halls Head, as the homes there are, by their nature, very low-lying. More generally, concerns were raised about the close proximity of some of the canal development to Ramsar wetlands. I recall the row that occurred over the Creery Wetlands and their ability to be developed. In my electorate of Canning, the Peel-Yalgorup wetlands are listed as wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar treaty. As a member of Friends of Ramsar Action Group for the Yalgorup Lakes Environment, which has the acronym FRAGYLE, I am keenly aware of the sensitive issues facing our wetlands and am determined that should we find the right balance between housing development in such areas as Preston Beach on the one hand and protecting the flora and fauna of our unique wetlands on the other. The Yalgorup lakes are the home of a MAIN COMMITTEE very ancient and primitive form of life, the stromatolites that are found in the lakes. They need all the protection that they can get, because they are a very ancient form of life. The committee recommends the development of an intergovernmental agreement formally endorsed by COAG to determine the roles and responsibilities of the three tiers of government. This is vital to ensure that we create an effective and cohesive coastal zone management system building on from the foundation work that has already been conducted by a number of different councils and governments across the country. I would like to endorse the committee’s recommendation for an urgent clarification of liability issues associated with private property holders, public authorities, risk disclosure and whether there should be a broader indemnification of local government authorities in relation to coastal hazards. This clarification will go a long way to allaying the concerns raised by many stakeholders throughout the committee’s investigation and will create a solid base for the determination of future responsibilities. In conclusion, I welcome the recommendations of the committee report and look now to the federal government to act and provide a coordinated approach to addressing the impact of climate change on our coastal zones by providing information sharing and access to funding for further research and planning to be undertaken. However, I do not subscribe to some of the hysteria surrounding the rising sea levels that ensues in some of the debates, because, as has been pointed out, what we are talking about in the first stage is very minimal, incremental increases of levels. However, over a long period of time we expect that there will be effects of climate change, as there is global warming, that will affect low-lying areas. I am not suggesting to people, particularly in my electorate, that they devalue their homes, nor am I trying to cause panic in terms of their titles because there is going to be a Noah’s ark type event in the near future, but I am pleased to see that the city of Mandurah, representing the majority of the coastal community in my electorate, have been so proactive in seeking to future-proof developments. I congratulate them on their work so far. Finally, as others have said today, I await Minister Wong’s response to the committee’s recommendations in due course. Ms REA (Bonner) (5.17 pm)-I welcome the introduction to the parliament of this report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts, Managing our coastal zone in a changing climate: the time to act is now. I do not serve as a member on the committee, but I am very keen to speak to this report because, representing the southern bay-side suburbs of Brisbane, on one of the most beautiful stretches of water we have in this country, Moreton Bay, I am very concerned about some of the analysis and information that has been provided in this report about the impact on my electorate and the businesses and residents within its boundaries. When we see information regarding rising sea levels, we are concerned, but there is also clearly a concern regarding the increase in extreme weather events and the impact of high tides and storm surges on any businesses, property and residences along any part of our coastline, particularly in Queensland. That is certainly of concern, so I welcome the committee’s deliberations in this regard and certainly support the recommendations and thank the committee members for their efforts. As has been said on many occasions in this place, the impact of climate change is one of the greatest challenges that we will see within our lifetime. If we as a government, as a community, indeed as a global community, do not start to address some of the impacts of climate MAIN COMMITTEE change, the reality will be not just a document this thick; the reality will be the impact on people’s lives and their livelihoods. I therefore welcome, as I said, this very comprehensive report. I welcome first and foremost that there is a great deal of analysis, information and scientific evidence contained within the report that I hope will, once and for all, convince those who are sceptical or reluctant to take action on this matter that we cannot continue that debate any longer, that we must move on and start to take serious action as a parliament and as a country. In that vein, I urge all members of this parliament to support the proposal of the Minister for Climate Change and Water for a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. What is critical about this report, as I have already mentioned, is that it talks about two key impacts which I think will be significant for my electorate of Bonner. One is rising sea levels. We see that climate change is impacting on sea levels and will continue to do so. The bayside suburbs are very old and very well established. So, whilst we may not have the issues around future development that exist in other parts of the Queensland coastline, those well established communities depend on their land being stable and not being impacted on by rising sea levels. It is also a very beautiful part of Brisbane because it contains the river and several major creek catchments-the most notable being Bulimba Creek and Tingalpa Creek. All of these creeks and the river in our part of the electorate are tidal, so high tides increasing flooding and the combination of heavy rainfall and storm surges have a very direct and real impact on many residents in my electorate. First and foremost this report has given us some very clear information that not only spells out the consequences of what we are doing now but also talks about ways in which we can attempt to mitigate climate change and protect people in the future. Indeed, even in the last week we saw the impacts of extreme weather events. Brisbane, being a subtropical city, is obviously well known for its rainfall and its greenery. Up until last Monday, we had gone for 138 days without rain-a fairly significant event in Brisbane’s climatic calendar. That dry period was broken by an incredibly severe storm on Monday night. I know it was severe, because my husband-with other partners-had flown back after attending the Prime Minister’s wife’s lunch for Pink Ribbon Day. They landed in Brisbane at 6.30 and sat in a plane on the tarmac for 2½ hours because of the severity of the storm and lightning strikes, which prevented staff from going out, getting baggage and taxiing the plane in. Not only did I suffer personally an extreme weather event by having a fairly frustrated husband on the other end of the phone; it disrupted the running of the airport quite dramatically. Planes were delayed. People travelling to Sydney had to find overnight accommodation because of the curfew. The social and psychological effects as well as the economic effect of these events were clearly witnessed as recently as this Monday. I am very pleased that this report provides not just good analysis and information but very clear recommendations for the way forward. It does so in three key areas. There are 47 recommendations, and I also will not read them out. That number of recommendations indicates not just the seriousness of the problem but also the commitment of the committee to trying to tackle this problem in a very real and detailed manner. The first part of the report and its recommendations deals with the need-indeed, desire and necessity-for national leadership on this issue. The impact of climate change is of national interest and therefore as a nation we need leadership to deal with it. I am very pleased that there are a vast range of recommendaMAIN COMMITTEE tions that deal with this issue: a COAG intergovernmental agreement on the coastal zone; a national coastal zone policy; the establishment of a national coastal advisory council; the establishment of a national coastal zone database; the promotion of 2012 as the Year of the Coast; the establishment of a national catchment coast marine management program; and, I think very importantly, funding support for the Australian coastal alliance in providing national information and communication information and interface between research organisations, local government authorities and other coastal stakeholders. I guess they come across purely as words, policies and advisory bodies at this point in time, but we all know that leadership comes from good coordination, good facilitation and the ability to bring everybody together-all of the stakeholders and interest groups-and to get everybody working together to deal with this issue. These are not just words on paper, they are very real and important developments that I think will help to resolve this issue. Another thing that is very important about these recommendations is that not only do they talk about national leadership but also working with the stakeholders at all levels of government. Coming from a local government background I understand full well the massive impact of planning decisions, made by councils up and down the coast of Australia, on local communities. In my own area very significant wetland areas in Hemmant and Tingalpa are subject to development. There are flooding issues, there are issues of tidal impact-the floods are impacted by tides-we are right on the border of a Ramsar site, Moreton Bay and Moreton Island, so every single decision by the council to clear or to develop land within those areas has a massive impact not just on the property itself but also on neighbouring properties. Once again leadership is needed to start to get councils to think strategically, not one development application at a time and certainly not simply giving regard to the existing zoning. It is important for them to have the information they need to get an understanding of what they need to plan for in terms of future changes. I also see that there are a lot of recommendations regarding coastal climate change and its impact on people and their livelihoods. In this report many speakers talk about issues around liability and insurance, genuine issues that we are going to have to tackle and that will have great impact on people living in these coastal communities, on the insurance industry and on our economic prosperity. At last we have the documentation to give us the information that will provide some policy development on this matter. In terms of the impact on residences and issues of liability insurance it is probably not as significant for my electorate, but I think the member for Bowman will be very interested in those issues and the impact of rising sea levels. He has many island communities and many canal estates in his electorate. I would say that he will grab this report with gusto and encouraging whatever action can be taken to protect his local residents as well. From my perspective I am concerned about the environmental impacts that have been outlined in this report. I have talked about creek catchments, the magnificent jewel in the crown of Moreton Island which is within my electorate, and many of the catchment areas like Hemmant and Tingalpa, the areas around Lota Creek and Wynnum Creek. The mangroves that run along the bay are very important and I am pleased to see that there are recommendations that I believe will go a long way to protecting those very precious areas. A proposal to amend the EPBC Act to address the cumulative impacts of coastal development, as I said not just isolated development applications, but the cumulative impact of allowing all the land that is currently zoned for MAIN COMMITTEE development to be redeveloped. What will its impact be in terms of runoff, flooding and on our flood plains? An increase in the number of coastal wetlands classified as Ramsar sites and ensuring that all Ramsar listed wetlands have effective management plans. I believe that we have good management plans for Moreton Island and Moreton Bay, but we need to be vigilant about making sure that they are adhered to and that the recommendations and actions within those plans are implemented. I also commend the work of one of my local environment groups, particularly Daryl Evans, who runs the Hemmant and Tingalpa Wetlands Conservation Group. He is very diligent in his commitment to protecting these wetlands and he is very diligent in providing me and others with significant information regarding these issues. Indeed, Daryl has been providing articles and information about rising sea levels for a number of years now. I am pleased to see-and I am sure he will be pleased to see-a report coming out of the Australian parliament that reinforces the arguments that he has been presenting. I join with him and will be approaching the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts to have those wetlands considered as a Ramsar site. What is also important is the recommendation that Commonwealth and state natural resources ministers develop an action plan to improve the management of coastal biodiversity, including coastal buffer zones, habitat corridors, nationally consistent coastal and marine biodiversity monitoring and reporting frameworks, and coastal and marine biodiversity regional planning processes that incorporate regional climate change adaptation plans. That was a very long sentence; it is a very long recommendation. But, for the environment of Bonner, it is very significant. Brisbane is the most biodiverse capital city in this country. Its biodiversity comes from its proximity to the mountains of Mount Coot-tha and the Great Dividing Range, from its magnificent river and extensive creek catchments, and of course from it feeding into the beautiful Moreton Bay. If we do not get biodiversity right around our coastal suburbs and regions within the city of Brisbane then the biodiversity of the whole city will indeed be impacted badly. I want to reinforce that recommendation because, whilst it is wordy and may sound confusing, it has very important impacts for the community of Bonner and the city of Brisbane. I once again welcome the committee’s deliberations and appeal most strongly to the parliament and all of its members to understand that we must take action in order for the impacts in this particular report to be mitigated. It is not too late. We need to reduce our emissions if we are going to deal with rising sea levels. We need certainty for businesses and communities, not just those existing ones but those in the future. We certainly need to protect the lives, the livelihoods and the economy of existing and future residents, particularly in Bonner. I commend the report to the House. Ms MARINO (Forrest) (5.32 pm)-I rise to speak on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts report Managing our coastal zone in a changing climate: the time to act is now. Members may be aware that I became part of this committee in November 2008, partway through this inquiry. Even though this has been done previously, I would like to recognise the work of the chair, deputy chair and other members of the committee. I see that we also have present members of the secretariat, and I thank them as well. They were very important to the committee, and I know the MAIN COMMITTEE chair has acknowledged the work of the secretariat. The continuity of the support and advice that was offered was very valuable to the committee and I thank them for that. The terms of reference for this inquiry were basically the existing policies and programs related to coastal zone management, taking in the catchment-coast-ocean continuum; the environmental impacts of coastal population growth and mechanisms to promote sustainable use of coastal resources; the impact of climate change on coastal areas and strategies to deal with climate change adaptation, particularly in response to project sea level rise; mechanisms to promote sustainable coastal communities; and governance and institutional arrangements for the coastal zone. Given that the Busselton foreshore area is featured on the front page of the report, showing the very serious-sized sandbags, I strongly support the committee’s recommendation that funding continues for research to establish the wave climate around the coast so that we identify those locations most at risk from wave erosion and to examine how the wave climate nationally interacts with varying land form types. This further supports the methodology for vulnerability assessments and the importance of encouraging regional applications from local councils like Busselton in my electorate. For a shire like Busselton, with considerable pressures on the council from its very rapidly growing population and land use intensification, as well as the associated continuous demands for additional services and local infrastructure, the committee’s recommendation that the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government should undertake a study into the human and resourcing needs of local governments is particularly relevant. We constantly heard in public hearings and during site visits all around Australia about the limited resources available to many local coastal councils and the challenges of shared natural boundaries such as the Peel-Harvey Inlet, which is shared by the Mandurah City Council and the Murray Shire Council. There is a need to coordinate resources to enhance Australia’s disaster mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery arrangements in the event of possible major coastal disasters through a grants program, taking into account the need for improved data on coastal disaster risk assessment and vulnerable coastal sites. There is a need for improved access and evacuation routes for coastal communities, improved coastal community awareness of and resilience to natural disasters, and improved coordination of coastal disaster mitigation arrangements with reviews of the Australian building code and land use planning policies. Very importantly, there is a need for improved early warning systems for coastal areas in the event of storm surge, erosion, flooding, extreme sea level events, and the recognition of one of the greatest resources we have, the surf lifesaving group network, is an integral part of emergency planning and responses. This is extremely relevant for coastal communities in my electorate. As I said, Busselton is one of those, one with beach erosion issues for local property owners and for the council itself, with low-lying populated areas, a Ramsar wetland backing onto a canal development, as well as serious challenges in relation to existing and future planning and further coastal developments. This was referred to in the report following the committee’s visit to my electorate and taking into account the issues raised on site by Busselton shire representatives. I quote from point 5.117 in the report: MAIN COMMITTEE In terms of housing developments encroaching on coastal Ramsar sites, the committee was particularly concerned about a canal development in the Port Geographe area in south-west Western Australia located within close proximity to the Vasse-Wonnerup Ramsar site. As Professor Short commented, some of the big issues at Mandurah are those canal estates, and at Port Geographe, which are not only very low-lying but also cutting into acid sulphate soils and with all sorts of other issues. This merely begins to explain the key emerging issues of insurance, planning and legal issues relating to the coastal zone, matters frequently raised by those participating in the inquiry. The key issues are who is liable, who knew what and who knew it when. Coastal councils controlling public property and local private property owners are very concerned about planning and building codes and the issues of liability and responsibility as well as the insurance and risk issues, the availability and the affordability, the need for very clear definitions of how and when an insurance claim is payable due to storm surge and inundation, due to landslip, to erosion and combined effects of sea inundation and riverine flooding. The possible withdrawal of insurance for certain risks or regions, as noted in the report, will place increased burdens on governments and taxpayers, which in part supports the need for a nationally consistent COAG action plan on the coastal zone. Given the consistently expressed concerns of local governments and individual landholders with regard to liability, I strongly encourage the minister and the government to address recommendation 23 in the report that the Australian government request that the Australian Law Reform Commission undertake an urgent inquiry particularly focusing on clarification of liability issues with regard to public authorities acting or not acting on a legal basis to deal with protection, redesign, rebuild, elevate, relocate and retreat regarding possible coastal hazards; clarification of liability issues for private property holders who act to protect their properties from the impacts of climate change-something the committee witnessed in my electorate; legal issues for existing development; mechanisms to ensure harmonised local and state government mandatory risk disclosure to the public; and one very serious issue for all local governments, whether there should be broader indemnification of local government authorities. I cannot stress enough the importance of this issue to the minister and government. We came across several areas, of which Cottesloe was an example, where there was just a road between existing housing and the beach itself that may be subject to storm surge and weather events. In that particular area we had a range of government services underneath the road such as water and sewerage. In the event of those particular services being removed by way of erosion to do with a storm surge or weather event, the houses would be unable to be inhabited as a result of not having access to those services. Who is liable, who is responsible and who pays? They are the issues that came up on a regular basis and will continue to come up. The report noted the need for ongoing ABS data, particularly for regional areas like my electorate, and the need for very accurate and consistent information. This is partly what those coastal areas need, particularly local councils. They need consistent information on long-term demographic trends to assist in coastal zone planning and management. The Busselton Shire Council is front and centre in this issue, as it is experiencing continued growth. Planning and design of new infrastructure will also require additional capacity building in coastal local governments. Coastal communities of all sizes, whether they are a small community or a large one, will benefit from awareness campaigns enlisting the continuing membership and support of the extensive network of volunteers. MAIN COMMITTEE Nominating 2012 as the year of the coast is an ideal mechanism to increase coastal zone management issues and awareness. Individuals and their genuinely interested and engaged communities are often the key to practical and simple on-the-ground work that is so critical in natural resource management strategies. This would include coastal stakeholders, volunteer groups and the broader general community. Ongoing information provided by the national coastal zone database should include environmental data management and coastal zone planning information. A key recommendation of the report is to develop an intergovernmental agreement to be endorsed by COAG which would define the roles and responsibilities of local, state and federal governments involved in coastal zone management and establish a national coastal advisory council that would have a key role in providing independent advice to government and, most importantly, ensure that there is very direct community input into national coastal zone policy, planning and management. Much in this report reflects the statement made by Professor Woodroffe but shared by so many Australians whom I met and continue to meet. The Australian coastline represents one of our most iconic treasures, but there is no collective long-term vision for our coast. This report and the government’s response to it will determine whether this is perhaps part of a first step in changing this perception. I will be very interested to see which of the recommendations the minister and the government respond to and when. Ms HALL (Shortland) (5.44 pm)-I must start my contribution to this debate on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts called Managing our coastal zone in a changing climate: the time to act is now firstly by acknowledging the fine work of the committee, particularly the chair, Jennie George. She has visited my electorate and knows how important the issues that are raised and the recommendations that are made in this report are to the people of Shortland, the people of Lake Macquarie and the people of Wyong shire. It is a very intense report, covering a wide range of issues, and it puts forward recommendations that I believe can work as a blueprint for governments at all levels into the future. Leadership and direction in this area have been needed for a very long time, and this report gives us that. In my very first speech in this parliament I raised the issue of coastal development and the impact that it has on the electorate that I represent. Shortland electorate is a long, skinny electorate situated between a series of lakes and the ocean. It is one of those electorates that are exceptionally vulnerable when it comes to climate change and rises in the sea level. If we do not act then areas like Shortland will really bear the brunt of that inaction, of our failure to recognise what an important issue this is. The committee met with some representatives from my area. I would first like to concentrate on issues that were raised by Lake Macquarie City Council. I ask Wyong Shire Council to forgive me for not going into the details of their submission but I have a history with Lake Macquarie council; I was actually the Deputy Mayor of Lake Macquarie council and I know intimately the details and the problems that development has created within that council area-issues that pertain to pressures that are being put upon Lake Macquarie council-as well as the fine work that has been done by staff at that council in planning and addressing this important issue. MAIN COMMITTEE I would like to refer to a document that has been issued by Lake Macquarie council: the Sea level rise policy fact sheet. This fact sheet outlines the impact that sea level rises will have in Lake Macquarie; it looks at the rise in the level of the lake if sea levels rise. RememberI stated that the lake is one side of Shortland electorate and the ocean is on the other side. It will have an enormous impact. In fact, it has been predicted that, if sea levels do rise to the level that is predicted, my office will be under water, as will the whole of Belmont and Swansea. This is based on modelling. I do not think that that is acceptable and the people in my electorate do not think it is acceptable either. We all live in that area because it is such a beautiful area. We live there because it is a coastal area, we live there because of the lake and we live there because of its access to the ocean, but we also know that we have to respect and nurture our environment. The impact of sea level rises on Lake Macquarie will be coastal and foreshore erosion, a retreat of the foreshore, more storms and severer storms that cause enormous damage, and an increased rate of erosion of the beach alignment. We have seen this happen. It will lead to increased flooding, salination of water in creeks and groundwater, increased storm surges and long-term inundation. The ecological impact will include threats to ecological communities unable to adapt to changes in salinity levels and to changes in wetlands and mangrove distributions, and there will be other flora and fauna impacts. There will be damage to public and private infrastructure, it will have an impact on morbidity and mortality rates, it will lead to increased insurance premiums and investment will be needed for a number of climate-change mitigation actions. It is pleasing to see that insurance was one issue that was referred to in recommendation No. 19, which picked up the fact that the projected impacts of climate change will affect insurance coverage on coastal properties. I know that during the severe storms we had in the Hunter in 2007 there was enormous property damage, particularly in the coastal areas. At that time a number of insurance issues arose and that is still the situation-we are still dealing with some of those issues. I am pleased to see recommendation 19 in this report because it deals with an issue that is going to become more and more prevalent as time goes by. Another recommendation I would like to refer to is recommendation 15, which refers to the extensive surf lifesaving network that is in Australia. In Shortland electorate we have five surf lifesaving clubs and they are very mindful of the impact that rising sea levels will have in our area. There have been occasions when some of the surf clubs have been threatened by the impact of rising sea levels and severe events, so I am pleased to see that this report recommends including the Surf Life Saving association in the solution, because they know how important protecting our environment and looking after our coastal areas is in ensuring the ongoing viability of our communities. I would like to turn to a couple of other groups from Shortland electorate which gave evidence to the committee. One was the Catherine Hill Bay Progress Association, which gave evidence about a development that was proposed and approved for that area. Catherine Hill Bay is a unique little coastal village that has been featured in national newspapers as one of the places that people should visit. It is pristine and it really encompasses and retains part of the mining history of the area-a little coal mining town. There was a proposal for extensive development of that area, which would have had impacts on the environment. The development would have led to more erosion, it would have led to problems with extinctions of speMAIN COMMITTEE cies and it would have led to enormous pressure being placed on the infrastructure of that area and on other environmental factors. Recently, the Land and Environment Court in New South Wales rejected that application. While we are looking at this report I have to place on record my support for the action taken by the Land and Environment Court. There was a very similar situation with a proposal by the same company, I believe, for the Gwandalan-Summerland Point area. Gwandalan and Summerland Point are two towns of about 1,000 to 2,000 population each, on quite a fragile little peninsular. Development was planned for both those areas but, once again, because of the impact on threatened species and other issues, the Land and Environment Court revoked the planning approval that was given for that area. It is really important to note that one of the recommendations in this report refers to that very issue of ensuring that the proper environmental assessments are conducted. I commend the committee for including that in their report. The Shortland electorate, because of its very nature and its beauty, is constantly under pressure from developers who want to develop the area. I am pleased to see the member for Macquarie sitting next to me. He was a minister for the environment in the New South Wales government. At that time, he was aware of a proposal for extensive development in what is a wetland area. That was not approved. Now there is a proposal for that to be a wetland park and that wetland park will have the Fernleigh track going through it. That has recently received funds from the federal government. It will have walking trails, wetland viewing areas and a plethora of environmentally-friendly activities taking place in that area, and these things will also help preserve the environment. Those are the kinds of activities we need to be promoting. In my first speech, I raised the issue of the Belmont Wetlands and how they were under threat. To see a proposal to restore that area is really pleasing. That proposal will benefit the whole of the area. It will be very, very important for the environment. It is very important that we see that all of these proposals actually take place-the threatened species and the sand dunes-all those things that need to be preserved and enhanced. That links in to this report, Managing our coastal zone in a changing climate: the time to act is now, because it is by promoting areas like the Belmont Wetlands that people can see that there are areas like this in amongst the coastal development and the beautiful houses-and people love to live in the area, because of its beauty, as I have already said. We need to have these green areas that can be the lungs of the cities in which we live. It is the type of project that fits in with the recommendations in this report. One of the recommendations is that there be more Ramsar listed wetlands. That is something that I welcome with open arms, because it is all an integral part of ensuring that our coastal zone is protected. I could talk at length about a number of inappropriate developments that have been proposed for the Shortland electorate, but I would like to conclude by saying that this report is a blueprint that will see the development that takes place in coastal areas like mine take into account all the important issues that need to be considered when you are looking at planning the future and ensure that the Shortland electorate-(Time expired) Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts. In doing so, I commend the chair, Jennie George MP; the deputy chair, Dr Mal Washer MP; and the members of that committee that has brought to us such a substantial and worthwhile report. I have to admit from the start that I have had the opportunity only to make a first reading MAIN COMMITTEE",283,Committees
257,Mr Sullivan (Longman) (5.59 Pm),"I am pleased to rise to take note of the House ofof this report, but I felt it was important that I come into the chamber and make some comments on behalf of my local community. I also acknowledge the great work of the committee secretariat, which has supported them in building this report. The electorate of Longman, which I have the honour and pleasure to represent in this parliament, contains a number of coastal villages. In particular I would like to mention the Pumicestone Passage villages of Toorbul, Donnybrook and Meldale. It also contains the bayside villages of Godwin Beach, Deception Bay and Beachmere. It also contains Bribie Island. The report points out that there are 711,000 dwellings within a three-kilometre range of the coastline less than six metres above sea level and that these are potentially threatened. On Bribie Island, where I live, there is nowhere more than three kilometres from the shoreline or greater than six metres above sea level, so my entire community of 20,000-plus people, not to mention some very nice national parks, is under threat from the effects of global warming and rising ocean levels. The report does not go overboard. It indicates quite modest sea level rises, in my view. However, what it also does is suggest that the sea level rises of themselves are not the main problem. It suggests that it is the more frequent and more severe weather events that are going to create a great deal of the problem for people in those properties. The truth of the matter is that on Bribie Island an occasional king tide will break the seawall on Pumicestone Passage and put salt water on our roadways. We have been able to recognise, from the beginning of my association with the island some quarter of a century ago, beach erosion as a consequence of wild storms. There is regular pumping of replenishment sand from Moreton Bay onto the foreshore to shore it up, and at the moment there is concern-though it has probably died down a little-that Bribie Island itself will break through to Pumicestone Passage to the north, near Caloundra. That is something that the community in Caloundra-particularly in that part of Caloundra-are very concerned about. These things become a little more certain if the scenario that is suggested in this plan, as I read it, comes to fruition. The other thing that I think would be very interesting for people in my state to understand is that this report indicates that Queensland is going to take a disproportionate amount of the hit from a rising sea level. Of those 711,000 properties that I mentioned earlier, it is supposed that one-quarter of a million of those are in Queensland. This, of course, interested me; the report having been released and questions having been answered on it in parliament yesterday, I was able to pick up a Melbourne paper today and see an article in that paper suggesting what areas are potentially going to be worse affected and to open my local newspaper and find not a word. We are the state that is going to be worse affected, and the paper is ignoring the issue. IfI can coin a phrase from a former administration, this is something about which we need to be alert and alarmed. This is a report that suggests that our whole way of life is under some threat. I was pleased to see that the committee in its deliberations had discussed plans that might be useful and there was some suggestion by the Queensland government and by the Planning Institute of Australia that the South-East Queensland Regional Plan would be a good model for the governments to follow in planning for the future. Praising the Queensland government’s SEQ Regional Plan, the Planning Institute of Australia highlighted its socioeconomic and environmental inclusions, and I think that as we approach what may be the outcomes of these events we need to be sure that we take the socioeconomic and environmental considerations into account in order to make long-term plans for the region. MAIN COMMITTEE A great many of the people who are moving to Queensland and are putting pressure on Queensland’s infrastructure are settling in the south-east corner. As a resident of that part of the state I have to say it is probably the best place in Australia to live and we welcome them there and look forward to them continuing to come in sufficient numbers for us to have a sustainable, viable and ongoing community. As part of its work the committee identified key challenges. These key challenges are not new to anybody, but to my knowledge they have never been codified in this fashion before. Importantly, the first of those key challenges is involvement by the national government. One of the things that I find to some degree frustrating in talking with my constituents is the level to which the federal government is disempowered by the national Constitution. The Constitution sets out-I think in section 51-what the powers of the federal government are and it makes it very plain that all other powers will remain with the colonies, or the states as they became. On a daily basis a constituent will indicate to me that they believe the federal government has the power to stop a state government doing anything the state government might propose to do that the constituent does not like, and that is not the case. Similarly, with coastal management there are huge limitations on what the federal government is able to do. The important thing is that we need to create an intergovernmental role here, and the first point that the committee has identified is the involvement by the national government. On page 287 of the report in paragraph 6.129 our Queensland state government has provided what the committee has referred to as a useful outline on what the national government’s leadership in coastal zone management could be. It is the sort of role that my constituents believe the federal government should play: Lead the development of regional scale climate change projections …; Lead the development of a set of nationally consistent default climate change scenarios …; Coordinate and provide financial assistance …; Lead the development of nationally consistent methodologies for assessing climate change risk …; Collaborate and provide financial support for States… These are issues that are truly the province of a leadership role and federal government leadership in this matter is important. I noted today that in question time, in response to a question as to what the government’s response would be to this report, the Prime Minister gave an indication that the government was trying to take, essentially, an audit of coastal risk before responding to this report. The reality is that there are risks and we need to be concerned about those risks, particularly if we have substantial coastal involvement. As a local member I have that in my electorate as would a number of other MPs. I have a substantial area of the coastline of South-East Queensland in my electorate and this sort of report tells me that the people I represent need to be mindful of what is occurring. For example, one particular suburb, Banksia Beach, has an upmarket development-I will express it in those terms-where people are investing serious money in buying canal-side houses, large houses, and they are under some threat. When we first moved to Bribie Island, my wife and I met a fellow in one of the local bowling clubs who, with the encouragement of half a dozen beers, jocularly suggested that Bribie Island had been put in place by a cyclone and that one day a cyclone would take it away. We built there anyway and the reality is that he may have been right. If we think about the fact MAIN COMMITTEE that Bribie Island is less than six metres above sea level and if we think about the fact that there are already an increasing number of severe weather events, and it is severe weather events this report suggests are the problem as I read it on my first reading, then Bribie Island is at some risk. Cyclones may come south again. It is a long time since there has been a cyclone that far south in Queensland but severe weather events are the risk and that is what we can look forward to. In closing, I congratulate the members of the committee, who I believe have done a particularly good job. They have delivered a report which, on my first reading and with the knowledge that I have which is not extensive enough to be called scientific knowledge, but the report is sound. It is a report that I will now be taking back to my community and suggesting to them that we need to be very mindful of what is going on. As much as anything else, in communities like mine, this report actually underlines in bold the fact that in this country we do need to get our carbon pollution reduction scheme legislation through this parliament and off to the conference in Copenhagen so that the world, not just Australia, can get on with the process of trying to correct the damage that we have done over hundreds of years to our environment. One young lady wore on her T-shirt, although talking about nuclear power at the time, a slogan saying that when she grew up she wanted the world to be here. We want the world to be here for our kids and climate change and the effects of climate change are the biggest threats to that. I commend the report. Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts, Managing our coastal zone in a changing climate, is an important contribution to the national debate on climate change. It was a privilege to be a member of the standing committee in its inquiry and to participate in the report, which the House should note is a bipartisan report. I commend the member for Throsby for her role as chair of the standing committee and the member for Moore for his role as deputy chair of the committee. BeforeI note some of the key features of the report, I would like to thank the very hard working secretariat, who assisted in the production of this report. I thank the secretary to the inquiry, Julia Morris; the research officers for part of the time of the inquiry, Sophia Nicolle and Adrienne Batts; and administrative officers Kane Moir and Jazmine Rakic, who also served for part of the time of the inquiry. Most particularly I would like to thank the inquiry secretary, Dr Kate Sullivan, who was with the inquiry for the entire time that it was conducted and who worked tirelessly, putting in some extraordinary hours, I would have to say, in the production of the report. I pay direct tribute to her because the high quality of the report is in no small part due to her efforts as well as, of course, the efforts of all members of the committee. The report deals at considerable length with the science that underlies observations of climate change that have occurred around the world and the science that underlies the now accepted means that are going to have to be employed to reduce carbon emissions. One of the reasons that the committee saw it as necessary to deal at some length with the science of climate change is that, regrettably, throughout the Australian community and among the members of this parliament there are still people referred to popularly as climate change sceptics and perhaps referred to in more pejorative terms by some. These are people who do not wish to accept a very clear consensus that has formed among scientists around the world as to the reality of climate change and, most importantly, the contribution that human activity has made MAIN COMMITTEE",293,Committees
258,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (6.14 Pm),"This report of the House of Representatives Standingto the occurrence of dangerous climate change. If members of the parliament or the public were looking for a very fine summary of the current state of the climate science, this report would be a very good place to start. The report goes on to explain that what is needed in relation to dangerous climate change is mitigation, in the sense of reducing carbon emissions. That is, of course, the matter that is being debated in the chamber as we speak, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation that will be introducing an emissions trading scheme to Australia following on from the example of emissions trading schemes having been introduced throughout the developed world already. The report talks about the need for mitigation, but that is not the focus of this report. Its primary focus is adaptation measures. In other words, the focus is on what can be done by, in particular, the national government and also by state governments, local governments, industry and householders throughout Australia to adapt to the climate change which is already occurring and the climate change which is inevitable even if Australia and the rest of the world-because it is a global effort that is required-are able to bring emissions down to lower levels than they are at presently. That is for the simple reason that has been explained by other speakers in this debate and by countless others: that carbon emissions remain in the atmosphere for some hundreds of years and we are going to experience temperature rises and the other effects on climate which have been identified even if emissions can be brought down. The report notes in particular the direct physical effects that are likely to occur on the Australian coast as a result of climate change, pointing notably to the risks of sea level rise and noting for every state the number of coastal buildings-houses, commercial properties and public infrastructure-that are going to be placed at risk by the projected sea level rise. There is not agreement on the projected sea level rise that is likely to be experienced by the end of the present century, but there is agreement that it is likely to be substantial. There is a possibility that it will be measured in metres rather than centimetres but, at present working on the basis of a sea level rise of around one metre-and different states have adopted different predictions-potentially hundreds of thousands of properties will be affected. I want to bring that home more locally for my state and my electorate, which is to say, as noted in the report, that some 80,000 coastal buildings and infrastructure in Victoria are at risk from the projected sea level rise. Bringing it home a bit more locally still, in my electorate there are some 11,000 homes which would be affected by inundation if there were to be the Victorian projected sea level rise of 0.8 metre by the end of this century. What we are talking about is not merely a higher high tide. We are talking about increases in storm tides, storm surges and flooding from heavy rains, the effects of that on communities, and more of what could be called ‘specialised effects’ like increased salinity in wetlands. The report speaks at some length of the effects that will be felt on the Kakadu National Park as a result of rises in sea levels caused by climate change, which will lead to increased salinity, which will lead to a complete alteration of the ecosystem in that vast and beautiful park. There are other climate change effects which will also have an impact on the coast: warmer seas, more acid seas, and the report deals at some length with the projected disastrous effects of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef. In essence, the report calls for national leadership. It calls for action now, and it identifies the areas in which there can usefully be national leadership-noting areas like mapping, inMAIN COMMITTEE creased research, leadership in strategic and, to some extent, statutory planning, law reform and a national effort in relation to the insurance problems which are identified in the report. The response yesterday, at least publicly, by some members of the opposition was regrettable. I would point particularly to Senator Abetz, whose response to this report was about whether there was a need for speed to act on coastal erosion. He said: That is something that is going to have to be taken into account for future planning but, having said that, I assume it’s not going to be happening overnight, so we’ve still got some time. I need to say to Senator Abetz and to other members of the opposition-or to any members of the public who might be thinking that-that, as the subtitle of this report suggests, the time to act is now, and the sooner we act the lower the costs will be to the Australian community. The report deals with the problems that were identified for us not merely by members of the public who made submissions to this inquiry but also by the Insurance Council of Australia, which provided helpful and detailed material to the committee about the unavailability of insurance in parts of Australia from the risks of events caused by climate change. They are described differently but usually as things like ‘storm surge’, ‘land slip’ and ‘sea level rise’and of course it is a major problem when general property insurance is no longer available to property holders around Australia because of the identified risk, and the insurance industry has identified very, very high risks. We then have a problem as a community because our system of property holding depends in part on the availability of insurance. That is why one of the recommendations that the committee has made is for an inquiry by the Productivity Commission into the insurance difficulties that are being encountered in relation to dangerous climate change events. The other matter that I want to draw attention to is the detailed consideration of statutory planning that has taken place to quite different degrees in different states. Members would appreciate that planning controls are likely to be very useful in terms of recognising the future effects of climate change and, as far as it is possible to achieve it, ensuring that the possibility of sea level rise in land that is close to the coast, particularly low-lying land that is close to the coast, is taken into account in making decisions about development and building in such areas. The committee looked at the planning regimes that exist presently in all Australian states and territories, and I can exhibit a little bit of state pride in saying that the committee singled out the work that has been done by the Bracks and Brumby Labor governments in Victoria over the last 10 years to develop a Victorian coastal strategy, which is entitled the Victorian Coastal Strategy 2008. The committee commended the Victorian Coastal Strategy-I do not have time to go to the detail of it-as an excellent model in the way in which it had identified the characteristics of a sustainable coastal community. The committee identified the Victoria Coastal Strategy as setting out a very useful policy framework and detailed actions that might be taken by state and local authorities. The committee in particular singled out the Victorian Coastal Strategy for the integrated approach it takes to coastal governance. I mention this not merely to say it is terrific that the Victorian coast will now have the benefit of some integrated planning but to make the point that national leadership and national coordination of approaches to a common problem that is shared right around the coastline of our vast country is required in order to avoid reinventing the wheel, where one state, in this case Victoria, has progressed greatly and has developed a model of governance and a model for planning control that are able to be followed by other states. I hope that it is going to be MAIN COMMITTEE possible through national coordination, through COAG processes and through leadership shown by the national government for strategies, planning controls and governance arrangements that have already been developed to be rapidly applied in other states and territories so as to avoid them needing to reinvent the wheel. In particular I draw attention, and the report notes this, to the adoption by the Victorian government-it is now written into all planning schemes that apply to the Victorian coast-of a requirement that all development and planning decisions have to take into account a projected sea level rise of 0.8 of a metre by 2100. That has major consequences for decisions on where to build and how to build, and it is going to ensure that, whatever the position that was placed in Victorian planning schemes before, there will be consideration of that in future. The Prime Minister noted today, following on from a major speech that the Prime Minister gave to the Business Council of Australia in Sydney last night, that the national government will be progressing through COAG a national approach to climate change effects on our coasts as part of a national emphasis that is now to be given to the development of some strategic priorities for urban planning in relation to cities. As I said earlier in the speech, these are the adaptation measures that the committee has recommended be adopted. I hope that they will be implemented by the government just as much as I hope that the mitigation measures(Time expired) ments made by the member for Isaacs on the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts report entitled Managing our coastal zone in a changing climate: the time to act is now. We served on this committee together and I certainly appreciated his input into the work of that committee. I note too that he congratulated the chair, the deputy chair and the secretariat of the committee and so I will not repeat in detail the comments that he made. However, I certainly concur with him in every respect on the considerable work that they all did and the leadership shown by both the chair and the deputy chair. I particularly acknowledge the member for Isaacs because, in the course of our inquiry, his interest and expertise in this area was very useful in sourcing information from some of the people who made representations to the committee and also in providing the committee with information. I am very grateful that he was one of the members. The ‘time to act now’ report is one of many reports on our coastline and the environment generally that this parliament has presented. The other reports that I refer to in particular are the Management of the Australian coastal zone report of 1980; The injured coastline: protection of the coastal environment report of 1991; and the final report in 1993 of the coastal zone inquiry. All of these reports, which I have skimmed through in the time that I have been a member of the committee, drew very similar conclusions to those drawn in this report. But I suspect the difference between previous reports and our report is, as the title of our report quite rightly says, ‘the time to act is now’. Hopefully, the title will ensure that notice is taken of this report in much more depth than was perhaps the case with previous reports. I would be very disappointed if it is not, not only because of the amount of work that went into the report but because, after having listened to the people who made submissions either verbally or in writing to the committee, the words in the title of the report, ‘the time to act is now’, are absolutely appropriate. MAIN COMMITTEE",296,Committees
259,Mr Zappia (Makin) (6.29 Pm),"I was pleased to be in the chamber to listen to the comThe report was the culmination of some 18 months of investigations and inquiry by the committee. In my view what was very useful in terms of the investigations and submissions made to the inquiry were the up-to-date observations, scientific research and predictions provided on the changing nature of our coastline and its association with climate change. I believe this report highlights that climate change is real and that it presents the Australian people with very, very serious consequences which we cannot ignore and which we have an obligation to take urgent action on-an obligation both to Australians today and to future generations of Australians. The report contains some 47 recommendations. In the time allotted to me, I cannot possibly do justice to each of those recommendations. I say that because each of the recommendations are very serious matters that the committee would like the government to at least take note of. I will summarise what I consider the key aspects of the report. The report talks about increasing research and monitoring of climatic changes to Australian coastal areas; increasing the sharing of information between agencies and governments; investing in professional development, particularly for the local government sector; and putting into place disaster response strategies and coastal natural disaster mitigation programs. The report also recommends paying special attention to the Torres Strait region. The committee considers this region to be more vulnerable than other parts of Australia and that it deserves special attention because of the risks it faces with the changing climate. The report particularly notes that iconic environmental sites such as the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu National Park and all the Ramsar listed wetlands need to be monitored for the impacts of climate change. The committee was able to see the Great Barrier Reef and Kakadu and hear first hand from the people on the ground. They are very familiar with what is happening to these iconic sites and they said that in recent years they have been noting changes to them. The report also recommends that the Productivity Commission inquire into the insurance related issues and the value of properties exposed to risk. This is an important aspect of the report and certainly one that drew a lot of media attention-and quite rightly, because it is an important issue. The committee is also recommending that the Australian Law Reform Commission provide further advice on the liability issues associated with climate change. The committee also recommends that the Australian Bureau of Statistics monitor demographic and tourism trends. I will speak a little bit more about this later on, because, again, it is a critical aspect of what we should do and how we should plan for the future. The last comment I will make about the committee’s recommendations is that the committee recommends that an intergovernmental agreement be reached, where each tier of government has clear and defined roles and responsibilities. Again, that is one of the critical issues that arose from the committee’s inquiry. Time and time again, people who made submissions-whether they were individuals, organisations, the local government sector or the state government sector-said that they wanted to see leadership from the federal government, because the lines of responsibility between the three levels of government are not absolutely clear. Certainly, whilst it might be clear in terms of the planning aspects as to who is responsible-and most of those responsibilities fall between state and local government-in terms of getting the information that those authorities need in order to make the right planning judgments and planning policies, they rely heavily on the federal government. So, again, a COAG MAIN COMMITTEE agreement that clearly defines who is responsible for what and how each of the parties can support each other, I believe, is a very important first step. This report also highlights that the most effective action that we can take in Australia, along with people from around the world, is in fact to begin to reduce greenhouse gas emissions around the world. We need a universal scheme of doing that. Hopefully, we might be able to get one in Copenhagen in December. That is so critical, because, whilst we can take all the adaptive measures that we might be able to predict, the truth of the matter is that the best action we can take is to try and reverse some of the damage that is occurring and is trending in a direction that will cause even far greater damage than what we have seen so far. If we can get a universal scheme to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, then we might be able to at least control some of the impacts that we are likely to face if we do not. It was interesting that, of all the submissions that came to the committee, whether they were written submissions or verbal evidence, I do not recall one person saying they did not believe that climate change was real or that greenhouse gas emissions were contributing to it. Certainly, some of them were not sure about what was causing it, but there was consistency in that they did believe that climate change was real and that it was posing real threats to our environment, and particularly to our coastal areas. The cover of the report shows part of our coastline. What was interesting in terms of the sites that we inspected-and we certainly inspected a lot of areas along our coastline-was to see first hand some of the damage that has already been caused by coastal erosion. The issues relating to the Byron Bay coastline are now well known. Those issues highlight the damage, the extent of the cost, the complexity and the seriousness of what we are faced with-not just a seriousness that is based on dollars that might be lost but a seriousness that brings in all of the three levels of government in terms of who is responsible for what and a seriousness that goes to the heart of the other matter that I touched on earlier, as to whether such properties in the future will be able to get any form of insurance at all. On the question of insurance, which is a critical issue, it was interesting to hear a response in question time yesterday that, since 1967, 19 out of the 20 major insurance claims across the country were related to climate factors. In another response, it was suggested to us that, by 2040, the climate insurance associated costs to this nation could reach a trillion dollars. If those predictions are right, my conclusion is that one of two things will happen: either insurers will stop insuring a whole range of different properties and sites or, alternatively, insurance premiums will skyrocket. Either way, it is not a good outcome, so we need to do whatever we can to ensure that we do not get to that point. It was also interesting to hear only today the Prime Minister talk about the future population growth of Australia, which is expected to hit about 35 million in about 40 years time. Bearing in mind that some 80 per cent of the Australian population already lives in coastal areas and bearing in mind that, all bar Canberra, our capital cities are located pretty much on coastal areas I think one could quite properly draw the conclusion that most of that population increase of some 12 million or 13 million people is going to occur in coastal areas. That means that the amount of infrastructure investment that we would see take place along our coastal areas over the next decade or so is going to run into billions of dollars. The critical thing is that, before we spend billions of dollars, we need to know exactly what we are going to be spending it on and whether it is a wise spend of taxpayer dollars. The only MAIN COMMITTEE way we can do that is if we do the necessary investigations, do the necessary research as to what the impacts are likely to be in those areas where we are going to make those expenditures and then ensure that whatever infrastructure we build, whatever homes we build, are built to a design standard that is likely to withstand whatever climatic changes occur. On the question of climatic changes, most of us keep talking about what is going to happen by the year 2100. Well, the world does not stop at the year 2100-everything does not suddenly come to a standstill and, at 2100, everything is going to be okay. The world will continue and so will the climatic changes and the possible sea level rises that are predicted. So when we talk about sea level rises of somewhere between 0.8 of a metre and maybe 1.5 by 2100, it does not necessarily mean that that is where things stop. AndI would hope that the infrastructure that we might want to build today might even go beyond those times. One of the critical areas that came to the forefront in the course of this inquiry was that local government, which has a prime responsibility in these areas, is simply not well enough equipped to deal with the problems they confront. They do not have the professional expertise on hand. They do not have the information they need in order to make the best possible decisions for their local communities. And, almost without exception, they were all calling for leadership by the federal government. I think it was the member for Longman who, earlier on, quite rightly made the point that constitutionally there are restrictions in respect of what kind of leadership the federal government can show. But what I would say is that this is a matter that all three levels of government do need to work very closely on together and it is a matter that we need to act on now. the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts for tabling, and giving me the opportunity to speak on, this very important report, the report being Managing our coastal zone in a changing climate: the time to act is now. As I said, I welcome this opportunity to speak on this report as it is about an issue which is one of the most serious that Australia has ever faced. When you represent a seat like Hindmarsh, the western border of which is the coast, this is a big issue. It is a big issue for the residents in Adelaide’s metropolitan area. My electorate has many suburbs, such as West Beach, Glenelg, Somerton Park, Henley Beach, Grange, Tennyson, Semaphore and West Lakes, where there are residential areas in which houses have been built just metres away from the sand. We are contending on behalf of the liveability of our cities and the sustenance of our economy. We are concerned with the impact of climate change. This issue concerns the rain that falls on our land, the searing heat of our summers, the productivity of our farms, the very existence of our rivers, our susceptibility to drought and our exposure to raging fires. As I said, all of this is concerned with the impact that climate change is having on the world. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts has reported on the danger faced by our coastal zone, now and in the future, as a result of climate change. The report is based on the best available scientific consensus-a consensus about the threats our regions and population centres face from rising sea levels, the changing character of the sea through acidification and the increasing potential for damage to our coastlines, inhabited areas and infrastructure as a direct result of increasingly large waves, storm surges and king tides. MAIN COMMITTEE",299,Committees
260,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (6.44 Pm),"I would like to take this opportunity to thankThe report notes that the science is continuing to be developed. A lot of scientific work is happening in this area. People are continuing to study current observations and drawing comparisons with what has happened in the past. The size of the future threats we face, and the likelihood of their impact on our coastal regions, continues to feature prominently in our scientists’ research. What we are told is that the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projection of an 80 centimetre rise in sea level continues to be the most likely change that will occur around our coastline over the course of this century. To put this into context: through much of our human history, average sea level change has been 0.2 millimetres per year. From the 19th to the 20th century, this increased in excess of eight times to 1.7 millimetres per year. From 1993 to 2003, this average annual increase almost doubled to 3.1 millimetres per year-from one millimetre per decade to 31 millimetres per decade in around 200 years. The anticipated increase through this century suggests an average increase of around three times again-an average annual increase of 80 or more millimetres per decade. These are indeed dramatic increases. The rule of thumb is that, for every one metre rise in sea level, the sea will intrude inland by between 50 and 100 metres. As I said, I am extremely concerned about this and most members of parliament who represent coastal seats would be concerned. My electorate starts just outside the city and finishes at the sea. In fact, when I want to give a description of my seat, I say, ‘It is from the city to the sea with the airport right in the middle of it.’ Its border is the Gulf St Vincent. While much of my electorate is by the Gulf St Vincent, it also has sand dunes-very interesting sand dunes in that they are some of the last sand dunes left in the metropolitan area of Adelaide. The threat is also great to neighbouring seats, such as that of Port Adelaide, which is in the Lefevre Peninsula. The threat to our coastlines is not limited only to the increase in sea level. Greater threats, through this century at least, lie in the violent, destructive forces that come to the coast in the form of extreme sea levels. These extreme sea levels are what we see during acute weather events in the form of large tides, storm surges, severe waves and more frequent king tides, all of which sees the erosion of our sandy beaches in the Gulf St Vincent in my electorate and in fact in all of the areas of metropolitan Adelaide. We have seen these over recent years especially, as I have said, in the electorate of Hindmarsh. One particular beach, West Beach, has beautiful sand and sand dunes but we have seen the erosion of that beach gradually taking place over the last few years. People have witnessed jetties being battered and broken up. People have seen the power of the ocean crashing onto the coastal walls. I am sure the residents around Glenelg remember the ends of streets being submerged with water that had come crashing through into suburbia. A lot of damage was caused by that one particular storm. Sea water was thrust up onto what we previously expected to be safe land. This water was coming up and going into residential areas. Reports from people around the Glenelg area with flooded properties were of sodden garages and the reports were full of possessions being damaged. These reports were quite numerous at the time. All this is what we continue to face along the coastline of my electorate. Now, with the rising sea levels that we are experiencing, we can expect to see such damaging and dangerous events occurring more and more frequently. Dr Hunter from the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre gave evidence to the committee as follows: MAIN COMMITTEE … if you get a sea level rise of only 20 centimetres, which was pretty well what we got last century, that will increase the frequency of extreme events by a factor of about 10 … The events will happen 10 times more often, and this compounds … If you get a 50-centimetre increase, or half a metre, which is about the middle of the projections for this coming century, then you get a factor of about 300 on average for Australia. What this represents statistically is this: if we have had one storm surge swamping a suburb in my electorate, such as Glenelg, on average each year, we can expect in the not too distant future this event to be happening every single day of the year. That is the statistical likelihood of what eventuates with seasonal variations, but, again, seasonal variations may of course well be different. But it points to big weather impacting on our coastline over and over again for each and every year, causing enormous damage. This is what we will be facing by the time many of us here are in the latter times of our life. It is within view. It is not that far away. It is within our lifetime. The degree to which our beachside suburbs can cope with the onslaught is highly questionable. Also in my electorate in the suburbs of Somerton Park, Glenelg, West Beach, Henley Beach, Grange, Tennyson and Semaphore Beach we are already seeing the erosion of beaches. We are already feeling the impact of climate change. As I said earlier, we have already seen the erosion of our protective dunes. We have beautiful dunes at West Beach which are disappearing very quickly, and we have the last of the remaining natural dunes along Tennyson Beach and Semaphore Beach. Also, there is the infiltration of sea water into our rivers and onto our plains and through our suburbs and onto our properties. We are experiencing that now around the seaside suburbs. How long before the effects are felt elsewhere and further inland? In fact, a few years ago the CSIRO did a study which showed that the coastline could come in as far as Adelaide airport in my electorate. That was in a front-page story in the Advertiser showing where the new coastline would be. A half-metre to a full-metre increase in lake levels will do untold extreme damage throughout the suburbs, including my electorate’s suburbs of West Lakes and West Lakes Shore. I am disappointed that what the opposition says to all of this is that we should not do anything to prevent worsening climate change and that we should get ready to repeatedly and constantly rebuild our shattered coastline communities. The opposition in the Senate, which has already stopped this government’s attempts to reduce carbon pollution once, says that we should sit on our hands until our homes and our communities are swamped, and only then should we do something. Logically, this is the same attitude that earlier this week voted down the government’s Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill. These examples show that they are not interested in doing anything until it is too late. They are not interested in preventing any level of change or the destruction that it can bring, preferring to conserve their persona-that only they in the whole world have the facts, have access to the truth and have a grip on what is actually going on around the world. Climate change is a reality. Climate change is one of the most pressing issues that face not only our government and our nation but the entire world, and action is required now-not tomorrow, not next month, not next year, not in five years and not in 10 years but now. We should be taking action and the opposition are preventing us from taking that action. The committee report contains numerous recommendations, some of which the government is already working towards and some of which no doubt the government will take up in the months ahead. As we pass through the summer from 2009 to 2010, the government will be MAIN COMMITTEE able to say to the Australian people, ‘You elected us to work to combat climate change, and we have.’ The Rudd government was elected to combat climate change, and the work of this committee provides additional direction for the work already underway. I am sure that the nation as a whole is looking forward to the debate in the Senate over the CPRS. They will all be looking to see whether their representatives in this place, some of the people who you would think would be most concerned about the effects of climate change, do the right thing by their constituencies and enable Australia as a nation to build on our own systems for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Nobody else can do it-not those in the US, not those in China and India and not those heading to Copenhagen. We have to build our own systems here in Australia ourselves. Targets will come and go over time, but we need the infrastructure, the market systems and the ability to see what we are doing and where we are going into the future. We need that worked out here in this parliament, and the sooner the better-better for the emitters, better for the mitigators, better for the investors and better for all of us. handed down, Managing our coastal zone in a changing climate: the time to act is now, put together by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts. In this inquiry, the committee was charged with having particular regard to: existing policies and programs related to coastal zone management, taking in the catchment-coastocean continuum the environmental impacts of coastal population growth and mechanisms to promote sustainable use of coastal resources That is all very good. I am sure you, Madam Deputy Speaker Saffin, would be pleased to have that as a reference. The terms of reference continued: the impact of climate change on coastal areas and strategies to deal with climate change adaptation, particularly in response to projected sea level rise mechanisms to promote sustainable coastal communities governance and institutional arrangements for the coastal zone. I do not think many people realise quite how vulnerable we are to the effects of climate change in our coastal areas. It was quite an eye-opener when I travelled to North Queensland with the caucus environment committee during the previous parliament and took part in hearings about what was already happening on our coastline and what was being built there. There were very large houses, mansions, being built right on the seafront, with little in front of them except trees. This was only a few years ago, but people were still building very close to the shore in coastal regions. It is not so much the rise in sea levels that is of concern to me but the changes in climate and the fiercer climatic events that we will have to face. Those have already led to some extreme erosion, and not just on the coast. I watched the river in my home town rise to quite high levels this year. Although that has been quite usual at times in the past, it has caused enormous damage to the land on either side and on the hinterland, to some degree, because of the untimely removal of vegetation from the wrong areas. Yes, they were basically weeds and really needed replacing with natives along the banks, but the lack of understanding of climatic MAIN COMMITTEE",302,Committees
261,Mr Adams (Lyons) (6.57 Pm),"I would also like to speak on the report that has beenevents led to some silly decisions being made. I do not find it odd that many of the findings in this report relate more to the lack of information at a local government level than to deliberate acts by people to desecrate the landscape. Today one of the papers in Tasmania had the headline ‘Rising tides of alarm’. The story states: MORE than 20 per cent of Tasmania’s coast could be affected by rising seas in the next 50 years. … … … A federal parliamentary report says 17,000 buildings in Tasmania and 21 per cent of the state’s coast are at risk of erosion and recession from sea-level rise within the next 50 to 100 years. The media can be a bit of a panic merchant. Although we do need to take the warnings in this report seriously, there is no need for people to shut down and move away. There has to be some sensible assessment of what the risks are and how we manage them. Councils will have to review how they charge for works to fix and protect coastal areas, and residents might have to be differently rated depending on where they live and how their buildings are structured. In Tasmania the local government association’s chief executive, Allan Garcia, said to the Mercury: “Along the coastlines and around … rivers in Tasmania there is certainly going to be far more scrutiny as to the standard of building,” he said. He said people wanting to build on the coast would have to prove their houses could withstand climate-change impacts, and developments on reclaimed land would be less likely to get approval. “Any canal estate development is going to have some significant hurdles to jump,” he said. In North Queensland they build to meet high-wind and cyclone standards, and that is what we are starting to look at in other parts of Australia to address changes in our climate. That is not to say development of any sort should be banned, but it should be able to withstand extreme weather, and this is a new level that we will need to come to in regulations. One of my constituents in Primrose Sands who bought a block of land there 11 years ago joked in the paper that he would shift the sand dunes to improve his view. Now they are fighting to preserve the dunes that protect their dream retirement home from changes in sea level. Storm surges have already pushed through and widened a gap in the dunes from 100 metres right up to his front yard. So people must become more informed and aware when they are seeking a sea change of the consequences of building in very low-lying areas. We have some particularly vulnerable spots in Tasmania, and of course our island has a very big coastline. Some of those vulnerable spots are well known, but there are others that might need some attention. This report gives us a heads-up to take into account in our planning schemes and in our overall strategy planning at a state level. There needs to be overarching federal leadership. Coastal problems are national, not just state or local, but they do have those local manifestations, as I have mentioned. We really need some national direction and technical and financial support on it. So many of the local and regional bodies do not have the resources to provide the continuation of policy thinking, technical and information backup, and funding to meet the challenges of population growth in some of these areas. Infrastructure is how communities can best adapt to climate changes, especially if the sea rises a bit and there are storm surges and high winds to contend with. MAIN COMMITTEE This report gives a measured and close look at some of the problems we are facing and comes up with a number of carefully considered recommendations. I welcome the report and congratulate the bipartisan committee that has put the time and effort into reminding us of what can happen if we do not take the appropriate action now. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (7.06 pm)-The response to the report Managing our coastal zone in a changing climate: the time to act is now, prepared by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts, has been so positive in most quarters that it indicates to me two things. First, there is a recognised need for action to be taken to protect, mitigate and plan properly for our coastal communities, where approximately 80 per cent of our population lives; and, second, there needs to be clear, consistent leadership. The report has a recommendation noting that national leadership is one of the big issues, and that is clearly one of the things that is needed. I thank the chair of the committee-and the deputy chair of the committee, who has just joined us-for the work that they did in bringing together not only the report, which I have had time to work through if not to read in depth, but also the science, the knowledge of planning and all of the things that were needed for the report to come out. I make a few points on it. I have a coastal community in my seat of Page. That stretches from Ballina down to Wooloweyah. Ballina is part of the coastline that goes into Byron Bay. I note that there has been lots of commentary about Byron Bay, particularly Belongil Beach. I have a rural seat but I have a coastal community. A lot of the population live there. It has been an issue of concern. The mayors of the local government areas that have that coastal strip have talked to me frequently about it. They have said that we need some national leadership on it as well. The report also notes a number of other factors and says that we have to look at legal and insurance issues. Over the past period, in my area, as elsewhere, we have experienced some extreme weather events. They are increasing and their intensity is accelerating; therein lies the problem with climate change. I have had lots of flooding, storm surges and all sorts of events. SinceI was elected and came into this place, I have been in a conversation with certain insurance companies and with members of the Insurance Council of Australia about this very issue, because it appears that some people could end up being priced out of insurance and not being covered. Some people are not being covered, but I have to say I have had good cooperation in working with the insurers when we have had those extreme events. There are a few other things that have been happening. The report talks about the legal issue, but I would have to say that encroachment, erosion and liability are not new issues. There might be a different characterisation with the phrase ‘climate change’, but they are not new issues, particularly when you look at land law and climate change. There might have to be a different response, and there may be more of those cases that come before the court. Therein lies the challenge in what to do. I welcome the report. It provides guidance, particularly for coastal communities, in my seat as well as elsewhere. I know that local government was looking forward to this report coming out. On the issue of national leadership, which is a big issue in the report, I hope that we can find some way forward. The last point I will make is that I have had a look at the maps that show what rising sea levels mean around Tasmania-because the work has been done on that since the fifties; the expertise is in Tasmania-and the extrapolated work looking at Australia, MAIN COMMITTEE and it does give you some cause for concern. The report captures that. With those comments, I commend to the report to the House. Managing our coastal zone in a changing climate: the time to act is now. On Monday the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts presented this long-anticipated report. Climate change is certainly affecting everyone. It is one of the most important issues facing not only Australia but our region and the globe. A great diversity of people were involved in the consultation in Darwin. We had Stuart Blanch, from the World Wildlife Fund; Luccio Cercarelli, Director of Technical Services in the City of Palmerston; me; the guy from the Northern Territory division of the Planning Institute of Australia; Lord Mayor Graeme Sawyer, from Darwin City Council; George Roussos, from the Chamber of Commerce; Charles Roche, from the Environment Centre Northern Territory; and Dr Steve Skov, from the Northern Territory Regional Committee of the Australasian Faculty of Public Health Medicine. That just shows the diversity of people that are involved when it comes to the challenge we are facing with climate change. Just to localise it for a moment, obviously we have got World Heritage listed areas within the Northern Territory, such as Kakadu, that are under threat through the tidal surges that are occurring in our major rivers, the South and East Alligator, through climate change. For too long I think that this subject was not broached. It is happening all around Australia. I was on the Great Ocean Road with the Prime Minister’s Country Task Force this year, and in the coastal regions of Lorne and Apollo Bay they spoke about the erosion and how they had never seen it as bad. They had never seen the sea encroaching as far as it is and causing erosion, which obviously affects their tourist industry and affects the livelihoods of those coastal communities. I congratulate the member for Throsby, Jennie George, who is the committee chair, and her deputy chair, Dr Mal Washer. They had a very responsible job and did fantastic work in preparing the report. I must admit that I have only just begun to read it, but I think that all members should make the time to read this report. It is vitally important to all our regions, regardless of whether you are in central New South Wales, in South Australia, in the Kimberley, in Darwin, in Cairns or down in Tasmania, as the member for Page alluded to. As a parliament, I really do hope that, over the coming weeks, we can sit down with the opposition and work through the issues with regard to the ETS and the CPRS. I think it is absolutely vital that we as a parliament have a firm policy in place when we go to Copenhagen. It is far better for us to be in the room negotiating and protecting our industries that are emissions intense. Certainly being in the room, we can go into bat for industries such as the coal industry and agriculture. By not having a policy and not being firmly in agreement across the parliament as to how to approach this, you are not in the debate. It is so important that we take a responsible view as a parliament and that we can work together. I commend the member for Groom for his efforts in bringing in a position from the coalition’s point of view that they can work with with Senator Wong and Minister Combet in relation to coming up with a position that Australia can take forward, so that we can really be part of the solution regarding climate change and not part of the problem. That is vitally important. I once again commend the chair of this committee on the diligent work that she has done with this report. I think it is one of the most anticipated reports in the time that I have been in MAIN COMMITTEE",305,Committees
262,Mr Hale (Solomon) (7.11 Pm),"I would like to add my voice in support of the reportthis place, and I look forward to reading it in its entirety. I congratulate everyone who was involved in what is, I believe, one of the most important reports that this parliament has produced over the last 12 months. this report of the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts into climate change and its environmental impact on coastal communities. This committee was very ably chaired by my good friend the honourable member for Throsby. She is to be commended for this excellent report, which I think will make a real difference to the way Australians think about the possible impact of climate change on their everyday lives. I too represent a coastal electorate, including the bayside communities of Port Melbourne, South Melbourne, Albert Park, St Kilda and Elwood. Must of the western part of my electorate is built on sand dunes. If you look at the old maps of Melbourne, you will see that much of my electorate was saltwater swamp before the seawalls were built. Over the generations, thousands of homes, ranging from workers’ cottages in Port Melbourne to the mansions of the wealthy in Beaconsfield Parade, have been built along the foreshore. These many coastal homes as well as beaches, foreshore parks, marinas, yacht clubs and many other amenities in my electorate will be put at risk if the sea level continues to rise as a result of the uncontrolled climate change brought about by human activity. Even a slight rise in average global temperatures causes the volumes of the oceans to rise as water expands when it gets warmer. This is felt in increased sea levels. The report of the standing committee on climate change documents that the damage caused to Australia by rising sea levels will be far more serious than the loss of suburban amenities, although this is certainly important to the people of my electorate. It will cause grave and irreversible harm to some of our great national assets. These include the Great Barrier Reef, which will be put at risk if the surrounding waters get both warmer and deeper; Kakadu National Park, which is at risk of flooding with salt water; the Coorong and Lower Lakes of South Australia, already in serious trouble because of the drought, also risk salt water flooding; the beaches of the Gold Coast, and we saw that in all of the television coverage of this excellent report; the Sunshine Coast; the 90-mile beach in Gippsland; and the great suburban surf beaches of Sydney and PerthMs Hall-And New South Wales. levels rise. I am frankly astonished that members of the opposition continue to deny that this is a real problem and that they are continuing to obstruct our CPRS bill in the Senate. The Australian today too denies that this is a real problem. Its editorial commenting on the standing committee’s findings states that there is no need for the alarm inherent in this report. Both the Liberal Party and the Australian are at sea on this issue. There is almost no major country in the world in which a greater peril as a result of uncontrolled climate change exists than in Australia. We are already the driest inhabited continent. A rise in temperatures could devastate many of our inland agricultural areas, depriving our grazing lands of water as rivers dry up and kill off our irrigated farming industries. I hope members of the National Party, in particular, are ready to explain to their constituents why they are blocking the government’s efforts to do something to stop climate change before we reach that tipping point at which it becomes irreversible-which scientists warn us may not be too far off.

264,Mr Danby,"Sorry, and Newcastle. They are all in danger of being washed away if seaknowledged this excellent report and said, ‘Now is the time to act’. In an editorial entitled ‘Government must act on sea rise warning’, the Canberra Times argued that this report should not be dismissed and that the action against further climate change must begin now. To be frank, a lot of the reports this parliament produces are a waste of paper, but this one is genuinely important. It demonstrates in plain, everyday terms what the effects of uncontrolled climate change will be for millions of Australians and how it will cause economic and social loss as well as environmental loss. Its significance was reported in the important British newspaper the Guardian in an article entitled ‘Climate change threatens Australia’s coastal lifestyle, report warns’. The article said: With 80% of Australians living along the coastline, the report warns that “the time to act is now’’. This report is a testament to the political wisdom of the member for Throsby and her colleagues on the committee. The member for Throsby’s independence of judgment generated the big ideas behind this report. It is her great legacy to the future of Australia. I hope all Australians get a chance to read this report. I am going to put it on my website for my constituents to read, and I hope all my colleagues do the same. Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (7.20 pm)-I seek leave to say a few words in conclusion to the discussion. Leave granted. ternoon, I have tried to follow most of the contributions that have been made. I genuinely want to thank all members who took the time, in the short space of time since the report was tabled, to be involved in this discussion. I must say that one conclusion I came to was that all the contributions that were made confirm the timeliness of our report and the 47 recommendations that come with it. On behalf of the committee I want to make it clear that we have never sought to sensationalise the issue, but the ‘business as usual’ approach must come to an end. The individual contributions this afternoon and into the evening confirm the appropriateness of the theme of our report, which is on the front page: ‘The time to act is now.’ I am pleased that the contributions made by a range of members reinforced the practical relevance of our considerations for real people and real communities who are feeling the impacts now. For them it is not a theoretical debate; it is real. You only have to look at the front cover to see what is happening in the electorate of the member for Forrest or at the back page to see the homes precariously perched on top of a primary dune in the electorate of Dobell. The member for Bonner spoke, and I must say that we visited Moreton Bay and that I can see and understand why she loves that area so much. Recommendation 24 picks up a very good water quality project that operates in that catchment, and we are recommending that that be a forerunner of other environmental accounts that we might put in place. I think the member for Canning epitomises the responsibilities of a member in an area of growing population. Mandurah and the surrounding areas have huge population pressures, which are being faced by a lot of councils. They also have the pressures of development near a Ramsar listed wetland, and of course they are not unique in having canal estates with some of the attendant problems that we saw.

265,Mr Forrest,I hope that the member for Throsby remembers the gesture.,310,Committees
266,Ms George,"I will, certainly. In concluding the discussion that has proceeded this afLike me, the member for Shortland has a lake in her electorate, Lake Macquarie. It and its surrounding areas are particularly vulnerable, and I thank the community and the council for their submissions to the inquiry. We did not get to visit the member for Lyne’s electorate, but the contribution of Mr Keys as a witness is there in full. I think the problems of Mr Keys at Old Bar really highlight the level of uncertainty about issues to do with insurance and legal matters. I would encourage the member for Solomon to continue reading the report, because if he continues to read it he will find a very nice photo of himself and witnesses who appeared in Darwin. Similarly, I say to the member for Lyons that we have visited Tasmania. There is some very interesting work going on among the scientists in Tasmania in regard to the science of climate change. The member for Hindmarsh and the member for Port Melbourne have similar issues. To the member for Hindmarsh I say that I have been there and visited the Gulf of St Vincent. Recently we visited Port Adelaide, which is another hot spot. To the member for Port Melbourne I say that I had the great pleasure of living in his electorate for some time when I lived in Melbourne in a former life before I came to federal parliament, and I know the beauty of the bay there as well. The members for Fowler, Lowe, Makin and Isaacs were all members of the committee. They spoke in the debate and they played a very important role as members of the committee, and I thank them particularly for their contribution. I note that the member for Lowe could not help but refer to the media coverage that our report has generated. I do want to thank all the media for helping the committee raise public awareness about these very important issues. Having a QC on a committee like ours sure helps, particularly when we got into very tricky matters relating to insurance and legal liability. Recommendations 19 and 23 of our report recommend that governments give some urgent attention to issues regarding liability and insurance matters, and I thank the member for Isaacs for his assistance with that. It is a great committee. We work together very well. Each member has their own particular contributions to make to it. But I cannot let this occasion pass without extending my special thanks to the deputy chair, the member for Moore, Dr Washer. The bipartisan nature of this report continues a historic tradition since I have been a member of the committee, and the member for Dunkley referred to this in his contribution. I am delighted that the report came out as a bipartisan report, and I think much of the credit goes to the member for Moore and the way he handled the challenges of the issues we were confronted with. On a personal level, I want to thank Professor Bruce Thom and Alan Stokes from the National Sea Change Taskforce for their input and advice. I thank them for their support and encouragement. The Department of Climate Change provided very valuable input into our report. The many initiatives that have already been undertaken in the short time that the department has been in place speak volumes about the quality of that department. We have their Smartline project, and we are all anxiously awaiting the first pass National Coastal Vulnerability Assessment. That will certainly move the agenda along substantially. This report, like any report, is the result of collective endeavours. Our committee was supported throughout so well by our secretariat, currently headed by Julia Morris. I want to acknowledge the work of the secretariat in providing research and administrative support. I want to thank Sarah Hafez, a member of my electorate staff, for the assistance she has provided in MAIN COMMITTEE the ongoing history of the development of coastal policy. I thank the secretariat for their wonderful research and administrative support. We had 28 public hearings, 170 witnesses, over 100 submissions and nine site inspections. Getting all of that organised is no mean feat. Of course, the report would not have appeared without those who made the submissions and appeared before us. I trust that all your concerns have been properly described and dealt with. We do not have any magic solutions to some of the problems that came up before the committee, but we do believe that our report and its recommendations chart the way forward and bring forward your issues of concern, be you an individual property owner, a local government authority or a regional community. Whatever concerns we heard, at different levels of engagement on these terms of reference, this is, I think, the first time the federal parliament is dealing with these issues in a comprehensive way. BeforeI conclude, one person deserves the special thanks of us members of the committee-that is, the inquiry secretary to the committee, Dr Kate Sullivan. Dr Sullivan has been with us since day one, and I think we all appreciate, as members of committees, the importance of continuity and having Dr Sullivan with us from day one till the end. It is really hard to express in words her commitment and enthusiasm, her professionalism and her knowledge. I just want to say, and I hope the Clerk of the House of Representatives is listening, that people like Dr Kate Sullivan and their professionalism and exemplary work reflect very well on the quality of assistance that parliamentary staff provide for our work. So thank you, Kate; you did a great job. Thank you, finally, to Ministers Wong and Garrett for the reference to our committee back in March 2008. I know it has taken time to respond but it is time that we believe was well spent. NowI just want to say that we all eagerly await the government’s response to the contents of our report and the 47 recommendations that go with it. Main Committee adjourned at 7.30 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Israeli Settlement Construction (Question No. 1010) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 15 September 2009: (1) Can he indicate the Government’s position in relation to Israeli settlement construction activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. (2) Has the Government expressed its view to the (a) United States, (b) Israel, and (c) Palestinian authority, in response to President Barack Obama’s call for a halt to all construction; if so, what was expressed. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Government’s position is that Israel needs to freeze all settlement activity. This is one of Israel’s obligations under the Roadmap for Middle East peace. The Government believes it is important that the parties, with the support of the international community, honour the agreements they have entered into as part of the Roadmap. This means the Palestinians must also honour their agreements, including continuing to dismantle terrorist infrastructure and to halt violence and incitement. The Government’s position on settlements is guided by Australia’s strong support for Israel’s ongoing security, the Middle East peace process and a two-state solution, and the striving for a just and enduring peace. (2) The Government position on settlements has been stated publicly and in discussions with the parties to the peace process. Lyne Electorate: Letters from Constituents (Question No. 1030) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 17 September 2009.

(6) Ms Joan Grant of Eastwood, NSW, dated 8 April and 6 July 2009, about the stimulus payments. Ms Macklin-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) I responded to your representations on behalf of Mr Allen on 3 September 2009. (2) Your representations on behalf of Mr Bohannon, Ms Barrett, Mr Southward, Mr Schwab and Ms Grant were referred to the Treasurer’s Office for response.
