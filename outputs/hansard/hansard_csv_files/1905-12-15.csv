At one time, under the electoral law of New South Wales, it was .necessary to lodge Â£ 4 0 with a nomination paper, and, under that system, a defeated candidate rarely lost his deposit. After .a time, the State Parliament, in its wis-dom, decided to repeal the provision re-quiring a deposit to be lodged, and the aresult was that in almost every electorate ,a contest took place. Men who had not the slightest chance of being returned frequently offered themselves for election, and the country was thus put to much unnecessary expense. 'Senate elections must take place on the same day as those for the House of Representatives, so that no saving can be effected by the continuance of the deposit -system. honourable member. On one occasion, nominations were invited for the State electorate of which I was the representative, ^ind it was generally believed that I was not to be opposed. But at the last moment a gentleman, nearly eighty years of age, who was somewhat deficient mentally, was nominated against me, with the result that the Crown was put to the expense of conducting an election, at which he polled seventeen out of a total of between 1,000 and 2,000 votes. In another case, -a candidate's nomination was signed by -seven electors', but he polled only five votes. which a candidate received only two. to which the honourable member refers. Frivolous nominations followed upon the -abolition of the Odeposit system, but as soon as the practice of requiring a deposit to be lodged with every nomination -was reverted to, frivolous contests were avoided. I am satisfied that the existing -provision does not interfere with the nomination of candidates who have any reason to believe that their candidature is likely i:o be successful, and I . therefore, trust that the amendment will be rejected. honourable member for Riverina, I think the amendment should be accepted. It -embodies a principle of which I have approved for some time; as the result of my experience as a member of the State Parliament of New South Wales. Originally, under the electoral law of that State, a deposit was not required; but, because it was said that a contest at a by-election was due to the influence of publicans, who -felt that it would lead to the distribution of money, the Parliament decided to require a deposit of ^40 with each nomination. That provision inflicted a hardship, not only upon many would be candidates, but upon their friends. case of hardship having arisen under it. able member a case in. point. An .able, reputable gentleman in my own electoratea prominent land-taxer, whom I hold in the highest esteem-desire d to contest a seat in the State Parliament; and, as he was not in a position to find the necessary deposit himself, a number of his friends lodged it for him. They expected, very naturally, that it would be returned, but, to their dismay, it was garnisheed. every elector 2s.. 6d. for the right to vote. case is the same. I am free to admit that I am not a wealthy man, and that, when I was first nominated, I should have found it a difficult matter to raise the deposit of Â£,40. No deserving man who wishes to secure a seat in Parliament should have to place himself under a monetary obligation to his friends. The corollary of a free franchise is a free nomination. to prevent a rush of nominations for the Senate elections? been an abuse of the system, that in some cases candidates have been nominated to split a vote, and in others merely to secure the expenditure of money which naturally attends a contested election. a candidate is nominated for mere amusement. the kind are not so numerous as to require the remedy embodied in the principal Act. If the purpose to be served is that of splitting votes, a deposit will always be found; whilst I do not think that the deposit system deters those who wish a contest to take place, for the sake of the expenditure which it entails, from, putting up a candidate.

As the result of my experience as a member of the State Parliament, I am strongly opposed to the provision in the existing Act, and hope that the amendment will be carried. would urge the honourable member for Herbert not to press his amendment. He must be aware that there are many publicans, who, although decent fellows, naturally wish to see a contest because of the expenditure of money that it involves, and are therefore prepared to put up opposition when a deposit is not required. does not want opposition:. do. The honourable member for Herbert must be aware that a Labour man, or any other candidate who has a hope of winning a seat, has no difficulty in raising a Â£ 2 5 deposit. If such a man experiences any difficulty in the matter, let him come to me. from those who think that the requirement that a deposit of Â£ 2 5 shall accompany a ' nomination is not a barrier in the way of many aspirants to politidal honours. It was very inconvenient for me to find the money to make this deposit, although I haa every chance of winning the seat, and I was prevented from using the money , while fighting the election. Before resigning from the State Parliament to contest the Federal seat, I did not see how I could obtain the money necessary to make a deposit of Â£ 2 5 , and to pay my expenses, but, fortunately, some of my constituents had some time previously opened a subscription list, with a view to making me a . testimonial in appreciation of my services, 'and I went to the electorate to see if I could be allowed to use part of the money collected, to pay my deposit. If I had been told that it was not their intention fo collect money to enable me to leave the State Parliament, I could not have contested the Federal seat. We have no right to put any obstacle in the path of the aspirant to political honours. pay for the privilege of recording his vote. if he failed to score one-tenth of the votes: man should not be required to pay to become a candidate for Parliament. No distinctions should be made in this matter bewithout a deposit, men of straw are frequently nominated, but it is not often that men allo^v themselves to be nominated unless they think that they have an opportunity to win a seat ter of Home Affairs) I hope that the Committee will not accept the proposed new clause. The sum of ^25 is so small that it should not prevent any candidate likely to be chosen by a constituency from being nominated. I do not think that any V one possessing the political attainments likely to enable him to secure a seat in Parliament will find it impossible to obtain the money to make this deposit. It has to be remembered, however, that the expense of conducting a Commonwealth election is very much greater than the expense of conducting a State or municipal election, and nobody, except bond fide candidates, should be encouraged to go to the poll. Where no deposit is required, I have known men to allow themselves to be nominated merely for advertising purposes, having no hope of winning the seat. to advance some political opinion. the election fairly and squarely. I have every sympathy for those who are F Â» oor but I do not think that the Commonwealth should be put -to an expense which,, in the case of a Senate election, might amount to thousands of pounds, by candidates who are not bond fide.

The fact that Â£ 2 5 has to be ""deposited has never debarred from nomination any manwho had a chance of winning a seat; but, even if it did, the inconvenience to an individual is nothing as compared with the 1 expense caused to the Commonwealth whenelections are made necessary by the nomination of candidates who are not bond fide.

At the present time any person may. nominate as a candidate up to the hour of 12 noon on the day of nomination, but once the nomination paper and the deposit are lodged-eve n though 'they may have been sent in weeks before the nomination day-the y cannot be withdrawn. That opinion has been given by the Commonwealth officers. The honourable member for North Sydney proposes that before any expense has been incurred by the Commonwealth, a candidate shall be allowed to withdraw his nomination, but that he shall forfeit' his deposit. It is not desirable that we should afford opportunities to bogus candidates to levy blackmail.; and, therefore, it is considered wise to provide for the forfeiture of the deposit. a man to withdraw his nomination, unless his d'eposit were returned to him? defeated. He would not have his deposit returned in any case unless he registered a certain proportion of votes. do all we can to prevent nominations on mere chance. ' The act of nomination should be regarded as a serious step. I can quite conceive, however, that after a man has, after due consideration, been nominated, the position may become so changed that he may not consider it worthwhile to go on. Under such conditions, we propose to give him a chance to withdraw, but the deposit which safeguards the nomination must be forfeited. Take a scattered electorate like that of Coolgardie or Maranoa. A candidate for either of those divisions may desire to hold his first meetings in the populous centres, and subsequently to visit the remote portions of the electorate. Consequently, he may wish to lodge his nomination paper with the returning officer some weeks before the date of .nomination. Upon the whole, I think that the proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney is a fair one, and I am quite willing to assent to it. way in which the existing law operated at the last general election, I recognise the necessity for its amendment. Under the principal Act, when once a candidate has lodged his nomination, paper with the returning officer he cannot withdraw from a contest, no matter how desirable it may be for him to do so.

At the same time, I think that if a candidate is allowed to withdraw, his deposit should be refunded, so long as his nomination has not involved the Commonwealth in expenditure. remind honourable members that under the Electoral Acts of some of the States a candidate is at liberty to withdraw his nomination up till a week after nomination day, and is entitled to have his deposit refunded. But under the Commonwealth Act when once a candidate has been nominated, he cannot withdraw from a contest. There is, however, nothing to prevent a bogus We should candidate from addressing meetings and canvassing an electorate right up till the lasc moment prior to the nomination. It seems to me that the proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney, if adopted, will not alter the present situation. I cannot see that very much good or very much harm will result fromits adoption. ness of this clause is that a candidate who makes his deposit, and subsequently wishes to withdraw from a contest, has no inducement to do so, and consequently he puts the country to considerable expense. I think that we ought to offer a candidate some inducement'to withdraw under such circumstances, but at the same time we should mulct him in a fine for his temerity in nominating when he knew that he had no chance of being elected.

There are now gentlemen in various States who are devoting their attention to the perfecting' of voting machines, and if machines are invented which will properly and expeditiously record votes, without the violation of the secrecy of the ballot, and in such a manner that fraud can be prevented, I think that we should make provision for allowing them to be used. The use of these machines is not made mandatory by the proposed new clause, and cannot take place until it has been authorized by a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament. I understand that the Minister will accept my amendment. of Home Affairs) I am prepared to accept fhe amendment if it is in order. It provides, in effect, that if , after thorough investigation by experts, and, I presume, a trial under very harsh and rigorous conditions, a machine is discovered which will fulfil the conditions essential for the proper conduct of a ballot, it may be used in an election, if its use is authorized by a resolution of Parliament. thorizing resolution would be equivalent to the introduction and passing of an amending Bill. ing machines have already been submitted to the Department. They are all Australian inventions, and exceedingly ingenious, though I need not particularize their methods of working, because I think that honourable members have seen many of them. I confess that, to my mind, there are many difficulties in the way of using machines for the registration of votes. In the first place, population, because the Commonwealth could not afford to supply them to every outlying polling-place. This would have the effect of complicating our electoral tems. Then, again, as has been recently shown in Victoria, machines can be manipulated, without the manipulation leaving any record by which the wrongdoer can be traced, or its being even discovered that any wrong has been done. be manipulated, too. detection of the offence-is more probable. The Electoral Committee recommended that it was worthwhile investigating the working of voting machines. The evidence given to us on the subject was that they have been used satisfactorily in large centres in the United States, recording the votes polled accurately and expeditiously. But the Department is not yet in a position to confidently recommend the adoption of any machine here, even if the use of machines were sanctioned by Parliament. I",23,Electoral Bill

One course would be likely to provoke as much discussion as would the other.

I do not wish to initiate a general debate on this question, because I addressed' mvself to it at some, length when I spoke on. the motion for the second .reading of the Bill. Whilst we have fixed ai minimum for election expenses, which will apply generally, we must recognise that the electorates vary widely, not only in regard to area, but also in respect of the distribution 'of population and their general features. Whilst Â£100 might be sufficient to cover the expenses of a candidate in a small and thicklypopulated electorate, it would he manifestly inadequate in large electorates, with scattered populations.

I think that the present provision inflicts unnecessary expense And inconvenience upon candidates. opinion, the general requirements of the Electoral Act in regard to the advertising -of public meetings, and so forth, have proved valuable, so far as elections in New South Wales are concerned. I remember that once, when I was contesting A very hotly-fought election, a statement was circulated by special horsemen throughout the settled parts of my electorate, setting forth that I was a member of a singleltax league in Sydney, which, in fact, did not exist, and that I had given a pledge to the league to support a direct land tax for Commonwealth purposes, which would bring in jÂ£8,ooo,ooo. That statement was published on a sheet which bore no imprint, and there was no means of tracing the author of it. It was issued to damage my chances, and looked authentic. Under the old laWj such a statement could have been circulated as an advertisement, but the Commonwealth law would prevent that being done. I do not know that the signing of advertisements convening meetings is so necessary, because I do not think that manv bogus meetings will be advertised but every newspaper proprietor should be required to see, as far as possible, that the advertisements accepted by him are authenticated, and the original copy should be sent to the Chief Electoral. Officer for examination. I suggest' that the amendment be made to read ""other than an advertisement in a newspaper convening public or committee meetings We should stand by the priaciple of the original provision, and, if necessary, strengthen it. For that reason, I should like to see an amendment inserted requiring newspaper proprietors receiving electoral advertisements to see that they are properly authenticated, and copies of them made available to the Chief Electoral Officer, if necessary. sion in the South Australian law has worked well for a number of years, and has created no difficulty. It has been said that the South Australian newspapers have been unfair with regard to the space which they have given to the reports of candidates' meetings, but they are decidedly fairer than the Victorian newspapers, judging by what I have seen of the deliberate and wilful mutilation of speeches here. until I came to Melbourne that I knew of this wilful cutting down of speeches delivered in election campaigns or in Parliament. During the Federal Convention campaign, the South Australian newspapers, however, took a course which caused a good deal of annoyance to politicians, by printing among the notes and news of the day what appeared to readers to be authentic reports of meetings, but were really concoctions of the paid secretaries of candidates. When', on one occasion, I complained of this to the leader of the staff of one of the newspapers, I was told that if I liked to do as the candidate to whose paragraphs I was referring was doing, and would pay 6s. an inch for such reports, I would be similarly treated. I believe that it was these practices which led to the present provision in the South Australian electoral law. I think that the name of the person authorizing the publication of any electoral circular, address, or manifesto should be printed, so that the people may know who is responsible for it. not go far enough. It should apply to leading articles as well. orable member that it does not go far enough, and I should be very sorry to see it cut down.

I have hitherto conducted my election campaigns without a committee, and did not employ even scrutineers during the last two elections. I should like to see election committees and all similar institutions done away with. In the interests of purity of elections in this great democracy the less opportunity we give for the expenditure of money in such a manner that it will tend to influence the votes of the electors, the better. Every advertisement that appears should bear the name and address of the person inserting it. I shall certainly vote in favour of retaining the law as it stands., should like to know whether the Minister could frame a provision to prevent candidates from issuing circulars to the detriment of their opponents on the morning of the election day. Bourke intends to move in that direction. I think that we are at cross purposes in this matter, and that there is a deal of misapprehension as to what the effect of the amendment would be. It would not cure the evils of which the member for Hindmarsh complains, and I suggest that the Minister should make .seme radical amendment in paragraph a of the section proposed to be amended. I cannot make out the meaning of the last phrase, "" and on the face of the notice the name and ;iddress of the person authorizing the notice."" The previous part of the section provides that the issue of an electoral notice without the name and address of the person authorizing the same shall be an illegal practice, and I cannot understand why the words I have quoted are added. hinder a person from giving a false name. What we want to do is to provide that no notice relating to an electoral matter shall appear unless it is authorized by the candidate. Every newspaper proprietor, before inserting an advertisement, should be satisfied that it is authorized by the candidate. That could be done in a dozen ways. The Minister will not achieve his purpose by merely excepting newspaper advertisements. That would not cover the whole of the ground. Tbe desire is to prevent the insertion of bogus advertise1 ments, or the. issue of bogus pamphlets, and I think we should prescribe that any publication of an electoral advertisement, handbill, or pamphlet without the authority of the candidate should render the offender liable to a penalty. I do not move an amendment to that eifect, because I feel that the Minister in dharge of the Billcould best draft a provision of the kind posal now being made is something akin to that which was intended to increase to /[250 the amount which a candidate might devote to electoral expenses. If the amendment were adopted any irresponsible person might insert an advertisement in a newspaper with the object of assisting the candidate. except only advertisements calling meetings. come the difficulty, because a person might insert an advertisement calling a meeting, and at the same time enter into a long description of the qualifications of the candidate.

We want to provide against"" bogus advertisements of whatever kind. We cannot prevent persons from signing false names upon election notices; but, as a matter of fact, the newspapers take care not to accept such advertisements unless tbey are fully satisfied that they are properlv authorized.

Unless some such appointment is made, the penalties provided for will never be enforced. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. That the following new clause be inserted :"" When any newspaper during any Federal election publishes in its columns remarks injurious to any candidate, such candidate shall have the right of having published his explanation in the same column in any subsequent issue of such paper to be named by such candidate, and the refusal of the editor, publisher, or owners of such newspaper to publish such candidate's explanation shall be punishable by a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds; and on demand of such candidate, shall, at the end of said explanation, publish the name and address of the writer of the injurious statement."" This proposal may seem somewhat strange to spme honourable members; but I understand that a similar provision has been in operation in Japan for some years. In that country, any man who is slandered by any newspaper has the right to demand that an explanation shall be published in the following issue of the newspaper, and in the same column as that in which the original statement appeared. Honourable members may say that the Courts are open to any one who may consider himself aggrieved, but I would point out that by the time that a newspaper can be proceeded against in the ordinary course the election is probably over, and all the injury is done. I know of one candidate who issued a writ against a newspaper after he had lost an election, and the newspaper paid thc penalty and published an apology in its, columns next to those devoted to the European cables. The gentleman referred to devoted a portion of the sum recovered from the newspaper to defraying the cost of an advertisement in a prominent place in another newspaper.

248,Mr Icing O'malley (Darwin),"Ithe honourable member for Melbourne will ""press it. At the last general election in Tasmania, a newspaper called the Burnie Server, attacked me persistently, and refused to publish my replies. That journal was backed up by all the combinations of slanderers and "" boodliers '' in Australia who subscribed to it, in order to defeat me. I think that a candidate should be in a position to compel a newspaper to publish his replies to their injurious statea long way towards, accomplishing the ments. much in sympathy with the honourable member for Melbourne, but I cannot support a proposal which is utterly impracticable. The honourable member will be well advised if he yields to the reauest of the Minister. It would be absurd to make a provision of the kind proposed without fixing upon some tribunal to determine whether the statements published were injurious. The candidate oould not be a judge in his own cause. The editor of a newspaper would be as much entitled to say that the statement was innocuous as the candidate would be to declare that it was injurious. Provision might, however, be made that a candidate who feels himself aggrieved by the action of a newspaper should have the privi^ lege of applying to a Supreme Court or District Court Judge in Chambers. An application could be made upon twenty four hours' notice-and if the Judge decided that the article was injurious to the candidate, he might order the offending newspaper to set apart certain space for the publication of a reply. the article were published on election day? remedy in that case; but, as a rule, newspaper articles published under such circumstances have little effect, because the majority of electors make up their minds long before polling day. In city electorates, perhaps, opinions may change from day to day, but in country electorates such as that represented by the honourable member for Wilmot, the electors would probably take a long time to make up i their minds, and having once done so, would be very difficult to move. Articles| published on the morning of the election day do little harm to candidates, because the public recognise that it is unfair to attack a man when he is unable to make a reply. If it were thought desirable we might prevent candidates OT newspapers from discussing election matt'ers within twenty-four hours of ' the declaration of the poll. I understood the Minister to say that he wanted time to consider the matter. the proposal standing in the name of the honourable member for Bourke would go object of the honourable member for Melbourne. plies only to "" false statements in relation to the personal character or conduct "" of a candidate. that as applying to me personally, and not as a candidate for Parliament. It would not relate to my political character or conduct. If the word ""personal"" were eliminated, I should say ""Yes."" The ""personal conduct"" of a candidate, I take it, is his conduct as a private individual, and not as a public man. Further, this proposal is confined to false statements, and I would point out that some of the most damaging statements which can be made in respect of persons are not necessarily false. They are frequently half-truths, which are much worse than absolute lies. may be injurious, and yet may be perfectly true. think that this proposal requires a good deal more consideration than the honourable member has bestowed upon it. I think a candidate should have a remedy in respect of any criticism based upon untruths, misrepresentation, or distortion which was injurious to him. But he should not have any remedy in respect of criticism which was based upon the truth or upon a fair statement of facts. would then have to determine whether it was based upon untruths? that in many cases the upshot would be that the Judge would refuse to interfere. Buti f a candidate were given the right to which I have referred, no great harm would be done.

MrM c LEAN Constitution makes it mandatory that Parliament' shall continue in existence for three years. must be issued within a certain period after the dissolution. MrM c LEAN ment might easily be dissolved a few weeks earlier. The greatest difficulty in the way of accepting the amendment has reference to the elections of the Senate. We must all recognise that in order to save the Commonwealth an expenditure of ,Â£50,000 the elections for the two Houses of the Legislature must be concurrent. If that difficulty could be overcome, there is no doubt that by adopting the proposal of the honourable member for Echuca we should be conveniencing a very large section of the community without injuring, any other class. me that the amendment is somewhat impracticable under present circumstances. At the same time, I would urge upon the Goveniment the wisdom of endeavouring to secure an amendment of the Constitution, with a view to deferring the elections of the Senate for two or three months, so lhat the elections in 1909 might be held in March or April. I would point out to the honourable member for Echuca that if his proposal were carried the general election would take place in October, and that whilst that would certainly be convenient from tlie point of view of those who would be engaged later on in harvesting, it would lead to the disfranchisement of a large number of shearers in New South Wales. 1 of sheep farmers. to the disfranchisement of a large number of people. The holding of a general election at any time between midwinter and the end of the year would not be convenient to all persons engaged in rural industries, and it would also be unsatisfactory from <-he point of view of the candidates. The first general election for the Federal Parliament was held, I think, on the 30th March, 1901, and if we could arrange for our ordinarv general elections to take place about that V time in the year, I believe that it would be found satisfactory to all classes of the community.

If a proposal to amend the Constitution were submitted to the electors, with the recommendation that all parries could afford to give, I am satisfied that it would be carried without difficulty. I hope that the Government, during the recess, will consider my suggestion. much heavier vote would be polled. do not think that any section of the community would object to such an amendment of Ihe Constitution. the honourable member for Echuca will not press his amendment to a division. T IT my opinion it would not be wise, in fche first place, to insert such a provision in *-he Bill, whilst in the second it is reasonable to assume that if there be no constitutional difficulty in the way the Administration for the time being will take into consideration the desirableness of fixing a date that will It would certainly lead best suit the convenience of the electors generally. No matter what day be fixed for the holding of a general election, some one must be inconvenienced; but it is highly undesirable that an election should take place during the shearing months or in December, inasmuch as it would be inconvenient for a large proportion of those engaged in rural industries.

In some remote districts, where, perhaps, only half-a-dozen persons ate settled, not one of them would be able to get on the roll without travelling some distance to obtain the signature of an elector to his application form.

The honourable member for Riverina lost some votes through informalities caused by the clumsy ballot paper issued for the first election; but there were practically no informal votes cast on the second occasion, because I took care to have the ballot-paper properly revised. Mr Boothby, the father of the Australianballot, who devoted a considerable part of his life to perfecting a system of balloting, has persistently assured the South Australian Department that fewer informalities occur when the voting-paper is marked on the right hand side, than take place when it is marked on the left hand side, and experience bears out his statement. The specimen ballot-paper set forth in form 0 is faulty in several particuber for Bland has correctly stated the case. lars. In the first place, it should provide for the placing of crosses on the righthand, and not on, the left hand side of the paper, and, in the second place, the squares opposite the candidates' names should not be separated by spaces of practically the same size, because that style of printing has close to the surnames of the candidates. caused electors to place their mark on the space between two squares, instead of in a square. printing the Christian names and surnames of candidates in the one-sized type, the surnames should be printed in a larger and darker type than that used for-the Chris1 tian names. I move That form O be left out. of Home Affairs) I would point out that under the Act the Chief Electoral Officer will have power to issue regulations. I much prefer that the squares shall be placed on the left-hand side. Buti f the Committee reject this proposal, I shall take their decision as a direction to place the squares on the other side. the Committee will adopt the Government proposal. when candidates have ordinary names, but some of them have Christian names which might easily be mistaken for surnames. Take my own name, for instance. Some persons might vote for me under the impression that they were voting for a person named Guthrie. The square on the left-hand side is closest to the surname of the candidate, and, therefore, is in the best position for the guidance of the elector. that the form proposed by the Minister will be adopted. I know that at the last election a number of informal votes were recorded, owing to the squares being on the right-hand side of the ballot-paper. The records of the High Court show that a number of votes were rejected, because the crosses weje put, not in the squares, but in the space intervening between the end of the name and the squares. on the left-hand side of the ballot-papersused for the election of representatives of New South Wales at the Federal Convention, and the proportion of informal votes was the smallest ever known. The honourable member for Boothby is apparently wedded to the practice that has been followed in South Australia, but experience in other parts of the Commonwealth has shown that it is desirable to place the squares on the left-hand side, I think that it would be advisable also to use a thick printer's rule for printing out In the third place, instead of the uneven spaces on the right-hand side of the paper. proposal that the squares should be placed on the right-hand side. There is a good deal in the contention that confusion will arise if the squares are placed on the lefthand side. It would be a. distinct improvement on the present system if the Christian names of candidates were made to precede their surnames, and the latter were brought out level, and as close as possible to the squares in which the voters had to mark their crosses. The surnames could be printed in heavy type to distinguish them from Christian names, so that the electors might not be misled by the resemblance of surnames to Christian 1 names. the opinion of the honourable member for Boothby. In the Electoral Act we adopted a specific form of ballot-paper to .which the electors in nearly all the States were unaccustomed.

If the squares had been placed on the left-hand side, next the surnames of the candidates, these mistakes would not have occurred. direct attention to the fact that at the last election the number of votes recorded in New South Wales was 282,000, of which 7,834 were informal; in Victoria, 262,000 votes were recorded, of which 4,818 were informal; in Queensland, 115,000 votes were recorded, of which 3,057 were informal; and in South Australia, 20,122 votes were recorded, of which only 542 were informal. The officers of the Department who met to consider what alterations it would be well to make in the Act did not recommend this change, although they did recommend nearly every other alteration which has Been submitted by the Minister. Why should we make an alteration merely for the sake of doing so, especially when it will lead to the adoption of different methods in the conduct of elections in the Commonwealth and in the States? I see no reason why we should not adRere to a form which has so far given satisfaction. [239] of informal votes recorded at the last Federal election was less than at previous elections, but of course that does not prove that a better method might not be adopted. I point out, however, that at the second Melbourne election there was a very much smaller percentage of informal votes recorded than at the first, and that was due to the fact that voters understood the method of voting much better at the second than they did at the first election. I acted as scrutineer for the honourable member for Melbourne at the Benevolent Asylum, where the greatest percentage of informal votes might have been expected. There were only four informal votes out of a total of the number who voted, not more than eighty or ninety had to be assisted by the returning officer in recording their votes. I point out also that the majority of candidates would not be placed at the same disadvantage as one of the (Tjentlemen who stood for Melbourne at the last election, seeing that he had three long Christian names, all of which appeared on the ballot paper.

I imagine that to any but a legal mind it would seem that the description of a man should have some reference to his height, weight, the colour of his hair, and so on.

In CommiUee (Recommittal): Clause 9ASection sixteen of tlie Principal Act is amended at the views, which have been expressed by by inserting after "" existing boundaries of divisions "" "" (e) Boundaries of State electorates."" of Home Affairs) -This clause was inserted at the instance of the honourable member for North Sydney, to enable the House to take into consideration the existing boundaries, of divisions. The amendment I propose to move is merely to express his ideas in slightly different language. I move That the words "" existing boundaries of divisions "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu appear that the registrar is bound to receive any thereof the following words :"" Paragraph d the following new paragraph.""

Claims. . . . shall be signed by the claimant and witnessed by an elector move That the words ""witnessed by an elector"" be left out. I imagine tnat it is not the desire of honourable members, to place any hindrance in the way of electors being enrolled. The retention of these words will afford no possible protection. What particular advantage could it be to the community to require a person to witness a claim to get on the roll? It could not stop duplication of enrolment, but it could hinder a number of persons, from being enrolled. ridiculous enough to require this claim to be witnessed at all, but to require the witness to be an elector is really absurd. This provision, if carried, would tend to keep more names off the roll than could be collected from time to time by the policemen and postmasters. If the Minister could show that it would afford any protection to the public, I should be prepared to consider [239]2 whether that advantage would outweigh the. disadvantage to which it would subject many persons. The witnessing of a claim has never been required in any other place in which this system ofenrolment is in force. It cannot possibly prevent duplication, because if a person were determined to be enrolled twice, he could attain that object just as easily with the aid of a witness as otherwise. In any case, it would be of no advantage to a man to have his name on the roll twice. of Home Affairs) I am rather surprised the honourable member for Boothby, because as a member of the Select Committee on Electoral Act Administration he must know that very important evidence, furnished by the honourable member for Riverina, and reports by the electoral officers for that district, revealed a state of affairs which justified the making of this special recommendation. The evidence discloses that under the existing law roll-stuffing may be Tesorted to. It would claim signed by a claimant. Instances were cited of persons who had been resident for less than one week in a division having been induced by an agent to sign claims. On that point there was indisputable evidence furnished. persons who had not applied for a transfer (Boothby) I from one division to another division, simply because they could not legally have complied with the Act, came in, and when a large number of new claims were handed in to the registrar he was bound to admit them. Subsequent investigation proved that these persons were enrolled elsewhere, and were not entitled to vote in the division for which they had submitted claims for enrolment. It is recommended that each claim should be witnessed by an elector for the division; and that it be made an offence to witness any such claim without due inquiry on the part of the witness as to the qualification of the elector. It is That recommendation was the result of careful investigation and deliberation on the part of the Select Committee.

333,Mr Groom,"Unde r this Bill a manbefore his name could be enrolled he would have to produce a claim attested by an elector. that make? eLector were to witness a claim without making a proper inquiry, he would be liable to punishment. In Queensland the only persons who can attest a claim are justices of the peace. We wish to adopt the precautions which are taken in other parts of the world to prevent roll-stuffing. This provision is not intended to keep people off the rolls, and, in my opinion, it will not have that effect. In view of the fact that every adult in the community is an elector, what hardship can it impose upon any one? Unless the word ""elector "" were retained, great trouble would be caused, because it would then be possible for a roll-stuffer to get another man of that I do not think that the provision will have any of the evil effects which the honourable member for Boothby seems to fear. The returning officer or registrar is entitled qualified to be an elector. to place names on the rolls in the absence of a claim, if he thinks that a person is entitled to the franchise. It is only right that there should be some safeguards in connection with these wholesale collections of names. Under the circumstances, I ask the honourable member not to press his amendment. support the amendment, because my experience is that the obligation to obtain, a witness is an unnecessary obstacle in the way of securing the enrolment of electors. The Minister has not given any sufficient reason for objecting to the amendment. The case cited by him is exceptional, and affords no justification for penalizing electors throughout the Commonwealth. To provide that a claim must be witnessed by an elector means that the claimant must satisfy himself that the witness is an elector, and should it be found subsequently that the witness is not an elector, considerable trouble may be caused. The signature of the claimant ought to be sufficient. that the Minister will stand by the Bill. According to the evidence given before the Select Committee which inouired into these matters, deliberate attempts were' made to foist people on to the roll by the bundle, and, under the circumstances,, the registrar of the district refused to receive many of the names. signatures prevent that sort of thing? professionally engaged by candidates to collect names, placed himself in the position of endeavouring to induce boys to perjure themselves by swearing that they were over twenty-one years of age. No witness, however, would append his signature unless he believed the application to be bond fide. In any part of the Commonwealth, no matter how remote, a man has to get his application to the post somehow. If he posts it himself, the postmaster may act as witness, and if the letter has to be sent to the post-office, then the person who carries it may witness the signature. The object of the clause is the enrolment of names which have been omitted by the police, and I can see no intype to witness his claim. convenience whatever in obtaining: the signature of a witness, considering that every person over twenty-one years of age is not happen to be on the roll. provides for the signature of an elector, and, in the face of the evidence given before the Select Committee as to rollstuffing, a clause of this kind is most desirable. Minister seems to forget that the difficulty we have to combat is indifference on the part of those who are qualified to be electors. Amongst people who are anxious to engage in roll-stuffing, the necessity for a signature will be no deterrent; but the slightest trouble is sufficient to cause very many electors to neglect to make application until an election is very near at hand.

Thisclause slipped through without an -opportunity being afforded us to consider the desirability of the proposal to make the limit ten miles,, instead of five, as provided in the principal Act. The amendment of ihe original Act seems to have been introduced because of fraudulent practices within the metropolitan areas, and, apparently, in the belief that these fraudulent practices would be prevented by extending the limit a few miles. Such a result is not very probable, but if the clause remains as drawn, much inconvenience will be caused in country places, which are miles away from any polling booth-inconvenienc e -which will more 'than outweigh any advantage to be gained by imposing the larger ilimit.

Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 42A negatived. Clause 47 (Failure to transmit claim. Employers to allow employees leave of abopen to insence to vote). have been asked by the honourable member for Hindmarsh to move an amendment. Just before an election takes place it is the practice for various organizations to make a canvass of the houses in the division for the purpose of ascertaining if the names of all those who are entitled to vote are -upon the roll. The members of these bodies usually leave enrolment application forms with the householders', and after these forms have been filled in they collect them for the purpose of forwarding them to the Chief Electoral Officer. It has been found, however, that those employed in collecting these claims, instead of handing in the whole of tihem, destroy the applications of electors who are known to be political opponents. As a iresult, it frequently happens that an elector, upon visiting the polling booth for the purpose of recording his vote, finds that his name does not appear upon the roll. That is a very unfair way of cheating him out of his vote. Consequently I move That the following words be 'added :"" 182c.

In this proposal, howsix months or more than ten years. ever, I have followed the English Act more slavishly than the Victorian Statute, think that the clause goes far enough. because it happened that the first case tried under the Victorian Act failed. That defamatory statement will be liable.

I have consulted! several of the legal members of this House,, who agree that these words will cover all the cases referred to by the honourable member for Coolga-rdieand the honourable member for Melbourne. The intention is to prevent any person fronrmaking defamatory statements, with respect to candidates for election. with the general principle of the proposed , new clause; but it seems to me that it isdefective in that a person who makes useof defamatory statements against a candidate may raise the defence that he honestly believed them to Be true. be shown for that belief. provision in the English Act. for libel such a defence could not be successfully raised. No man is entitled to make defamatory statements, even if he believes, them to be true.

I have special reason for taking up this attitude, since at the last .general election statements of the most defamatory character were circulated in re.gard to me, and circulated, too, by well meaning, but misguided, ladies in some cases, against whom one would be naturally loth to take legal proceedings, especially as the slanders had, in the first place, been manufactured by men who screened themselves behind the women in their dissemination. It was reported, for instance, that I was a most immoral, dissipated, and brutal individual, and that I had several -children, whom I used to hang up in a -wood-shed and flog almost to death. As a matter of fact, I have no young children. -carries in himself the refutation of such -charges. far as those who know me are concerned; but the point is that such statements might have been made to many persons who were not personally! acquainted with me. I think the clause is loosely worded, and -does not sufficiently safeguard candidates from imputations of a scandalous character. think that we are loading up the Bill in a way that is altogether unnecessary. During :an election campaign, scandalous statements in regard to candidates are often circulated, :and on hearing what has been said about me at such times, I have been inclined to ""think that I ought to be hanged. But I do not believe that we should trouble about these matters; I do not think it is necessary to provide against them ih the BillI f we are going to do so, however, let us take care that there shall be no escape for those who circulate these defa matory statements. I think that the proviso -as to reasonable belief in the truth of the -statements ought to be eliminated. rto support the amendment. The law already offers sufficient safeguards, and I fail to see why a candidate for parliamentary honours should, be protected against defamatory statements to an extent beyond the protection whicE is given the general ibody of citizens'.

These attempts to regulate human conduct by means of paper laws compel men to practise deception, and, instead of elevating humannature, do the reverse. Attempts to make men moral by Act of Parliament always fail. Let the man who cannot afford to make gifts have the courage to say to his electors, "" I cannot give to this or that cause "" ; but do not deprive a man who desires, to be generous of trie right to -be so. I am in no better position financially than is the honourable member for Darwin* who is always whining about the way in> which he has to give to his electors, and asking that his salary be increased. I question whether he really gives very much. But why should a man be prevented by law from giving if he desires to do so? a man from giving money to individual elec*tors? thing. What is there wrong in giving to a cricket club, or to any institution cf that kind? No doubt it is thought that men of wealth will 'have an advantage over poor men by giving more liberally, but I have yet to learn that a man can buy his way into Parliament. All through this session we have been trying to put restraint on individual action, for which there is no justification. I have heard of candidates for this Parliarment telling, the electors that if they were returned they would put ""the mining laws: right, so as to do away with ""boodlers,"" and would amend the land laws, although, they knew that this Parliament cannot passsuch legislation.

The honourable member complains about getting only a miserable Â£400 a year, but he looks very well on it. He would be in a different position if he had a wife and a dozen children to keep. If a man is generous enough to contribute to cricket --and football clubs, he should be allowed to give awav as much as he likes. -No doubt, every man should be allowed to spend his money as he pleases, so long as he does not attempt to bribe those whom he wishes to elect him to Parliament. If he wishes to be generous, let him be so before ""his candidature, or after it. The clause -merely provides that a candidate shall not aittempt to bribe his prospective'constituents; it does not prevent him from giving to a 11 church, or a charitable institution, or for -ihe relief of the sick and destitute. They say that money talks, and it never talks 'louder than at election times. It is, however, apt to create suspicion when a man -chooses to exercise his generous impulses just when he is asking to be elected to Parliament. think that candidates should be allowed to bribe their way into Parliament; but the honourable member's proposal is too wide in its scope.

I do not think should not be permitted to contribute even to the funds of a church during the two or three months that elapse from the time that he announces himself as a candidate until the election takes place. No man can devote his money to a better purpose than a hospital; but a candidate can advertise himself as well by contributing to such an institution as in almost any other way. I have no feeling against churches, because I am a member of a church myself, but if a candidate were rich, he could, by judiciously subscribing to the churches in the electorate, go a long way towards assisting himself into a place in Parliament. agree with the honourable member_for Barrier.

I always understood that a candidate was dedebarred from contributing for the first time to charities, and I have acted under that belief. But at the same time, I do not think that a candidate who regularly contributes to charities should be debarred from following his usual practice even at election times. jection to contributions being made under the conditions referred to by the honourable member for Wentworth; but it might be difficult to make a distinction in favour of such cases. The difficulty might be overcome by postponing the contribution until after the election. port the amendment, because I recognise that it will conduce to the purity of our public life. dates of small means to be handicapped in an election contest by the liberal contributions made by richer opponents to charities and other institutions I remember one case in which a rich man, who was contesting an election in New South Wales,, made a number of exceptionally large donations just prior to an election. I do not mean to say that that, by reason of these contributions, he was successful, but he won the seat. very frequently influence weak people in favour of a candidate. In years gone by, seats have been practically bought by rich men who have made handsome bequests and gifts. I frankly confess that I cannot afford to make liberal donations to public institutions, and I have absolutely refused to comply with any of the requests that have reached me. I cannot afford to do so. The country does not expect it of me. It should be made plain that a man is not elected to Parliament in order that he may distribute his allowance amongst his constituents. His honorarium is intended to enable him to defray his expenses whilst he is serving the people. A man who subscribes to a hospital, so far from performing an act of charity, is discharging a plain duty. Moreover, I do> not think that any great advantage is derived by candidates who devotetheir money to such purposes. But when they pander to the members of cricket clubs, race clubs, and similar institutions, they are guilty of a form of bribery. I db not think that contributions of this kind are necessary to establish a man in hisposition in Parliament. I was told by. old politicians in New South Wales that if I refused to follow the practice that had been pursued in the past, my parliamentary, career would be a very short one; but I stated that if I had to choose between becoming impoverished, and holding my position, I should retire from public life. I put the question to the test, and I passed through the ordeal successfully. Wealthy candidates should not be placed in a position of undue advantage over their poorer opponents, and I shall therefore cordially support the amendment.

I think that such a provision is more necessary in the case of a Member of Parliament than in the case of a candidate. I do not object to an opponent of mine spending money in this way, because I do not believe that it influences many votes, but it is unfortunate, in the public interests, that a poor man getting into Parliament should be at the mercy of a large number of people, or run the risk of being dubbed mean and unwilling to contribute to any good cause.

The Minister of Home Affairs raised the objection that it is vaguely worded, and said that any person might choose to feel himself aggrieved by moderate criticism. But he did not tell the Committee that the aggrieved person would have to convince a Judge or a magistrate that his grievance was a just one. Had he been quite frank he would have added that it was not the candidate's feelings which would determine the issue, but that the decision should be tested with the sober judgment ,of an independent arbitrator. I cannot understand the extreme censoriousness of the honourable member for Bland. He implied that the supporters of this amendment dislike criticism. I rather welcome criticism, because, in my opinion, it keeps public life healthy. The criticism with which this amendment deals is not exactly that based on lies, because it is only a clumsy writer who descends to falsehood concerning an opponent. This amendment is devised to meet suppression, distortion, or wilful misrepresentation. It is designed to protect candidates against newspapers which boil down speeches so as to conceal their full meaning, and then proceed from this foundation to raise their own superstructure. honourable member for Bland remarked that the newspapers will publish any contribution which a man may send. But I know of one or two cases in which two leading newspapers in this city .refused to publish contributions in correction of their misstatements. In facf,, that is rather the rule than the exception, for fhe newspapers publish only whaf suits their polioy. The honourable member for Bland seemed to think that, under the amendment, it would be necessary for the aggrieved person to obtain a second order from the Judge before he could compel the offending newspaper to publish a correction. Possibly the clause does bear that interpretation, and, if it does, it can be easily amended; but that is no argument against 'the principle. I do not agree with the Minister of Home Affairs that the amendment is unworkable, but if it should be considered that an amendment' would make it more workable I feel sure that the honourable member for Melbourne will gladly accept any assistance in that direction. appears to me to have for its object the coddling of candidates for public life. Public men must not be hypersensitive, because if they are it; will be a great surprise to me if they are ever elected. It is going altogether too far to call upon a newspaper to publish a reply to its criticism. Take the two morning newspapers in Melbourne. When one newspaper has published a hostile criticism of a candidate, invariably the other newspaper will present the other side of the case. If newspapers overreach themselves they will fail to accomplish the object of their criticism, as they did here in the case of Senator Trenwith. He was most warmly assailed by all the powerful organs, but, in spite of their criticisms, he was returned at the head of the poll by an enormous majority. Hostile criticism is the best thing in the world for a candidate for public honours, or for a Member of Parliament. The trouble with most of the newspapers is that they do not know Eow to spell our names. Very often we wonder whether they have in their linotype machines any of the characters which are required to represent-our names. I really cannot understand any one asking the Committee to enact this coddling provision. When a public man has initiated an action for libel against a private individual, what has generally been the result? Time after time The a jury has refused to award damages in a case of that kind. All this goes to show that jurymen consider that a public man is fair game for criticism. If , on the other hand, the criticism of a newspaper will not bear inspection, it will soon be dropped. If this amendment be carried, I 1 shall expect to see a more hypersensitive member of the House proposing that no interjections shall be allowed to be made at a public meeting, and that henceforth candidates jyill have totalk to "" dead "" audiences. I suppose that by-and-by it will be proposed that reports of public meetings shall only lappear in that most respectable organ, the War Cry.

If I can pass through "" yellow "" journalism and get returned, surely every other honourable member can survive hostile criticism. I wish to point out to the honourable member for Coolgardie that this amendment is really impracticable. Take the case of a candidate who was fighting his way through ?a huge constituency in the country, and who, a few days after its publication, received a copy of a metropolitan newspaper, containing certain statements, what would he have to do? He could not go near a Judge. He would have to bring before, a police magistrate, if one could be caught in a remote corner of the State, the publisher of the newspaper, and make him show cause why he should not print an explanation. solicitor in Melbourne to put the case before a Judge? ber expect the candidate to leave the constituency ancl go down to the metropolis and enter into the field of litigation for the purpose of getting an order, which might) be combated for a considerable time, perhaps until after the election was over. But, to put the matter on higher ground, newspapers have very high public functions to perform We cannot forget that when they are dealing with great public matters they Have just as important a duty to discharge as honourable members or candidates. The press has to advise and inform the public of what is going on. We have tonight, by means of another amendment, gone a long way in the direction of protecting candidates as to statements of fact by newspapers; and in this we have followed English law. Buti f we say that no newspaper, however honest its criticism may be, is to perform a great public function, except under fear of being hailed before a Judge, or a magistrate, and compelled to publish some explanation, or so called explanation, in the same columns under a penalty of .Â£25, I think it will be the public, and not the candidates, who will suffer. .To tell newspapers that they must not report public meetings at which some statements may be made reflecting on a candidate, would be to do a great in. justice to the people at large. clined to the opinion that we may rest satisfied with what has already been done with a view to protecting candidates against unfair press criticism. Any newspaper, whether country or.metropolitan, which deliberately makes false statements in regard to any candidate should be held answerable for its wrong-doing. My own opinion, however, is that the more . unreasonable the attack the better it is for the candidate. As a matter of fact, the representatives of the press, who occupy seats in the galleries of this House, publish columns of caricature and misrepresentation regarding honourable members. 'Praise, blame, and misrepresentation are used just as its suits the purposes of the press -wit h a view to ourry favour, it may be, with certain honourable members, or with the public, or the newspaper proprietors. The honourable member for Dalley, who has addressed us on this proposal, has had a bed of roses throughout his political career: He has ever been the "" white-headed boy "" of the metropolitan press, and I do not know that, under the circumstances, he may be taken as an authority on the question of what criticism should be regulated, and what criticism should be encouraged. Vigorous criticism is sometimes the lifeblood of a candidate for parliamentary honours. It has been my experience to. have every newspaper in the district, not only criticising me, but refusing to report one word of my utterances. Indeed, the onjy way in which I could induce one newspaper, whioh was not quite so bitter as the rest, to publish one address which I delivered, was to purchase 500 copies at 2d. each. However, these antagonistic newspapers over-stepped the mark, and fortunately there was time enough for me to demonstrate to the public the unfair and un-British conduct to which I was subjected. The result was that I was returned to this House. The same sort of conduct is pursued by the metropolitan press. I have known a metropolitan newspaper to reserve its criticism until the day before the election, when there was no chance for the candidate to reply, and then publish most libellous matter. remedy that sort of thing.",53,Pairs

I do not fear criticism, but I do fear misrepresentation, which is not criticism, and against which I. take it the honourable member for Melbourne directs his proposal. From week-end to week-end, the remarks of honourable members of thi House are made to bear totally differed hterpretations from those intended. honourable member suggest ? ? matter to the conscience of the press. member name the newspaper, or newspapers to which he refers? any distinction can be made between newspapers. The honourable and learned member for Parkes is one of the fairest men in the House, and, as he always reads both sides of any question, and stands as an authority of what is the correct thing, I am afraid it would be impertinence on my part to indicate the newspaper. am afraid the amendment is too cumbersome to attain the object of the mover; out the clause we have previously passed will give us some power over libel. orable member for Melbourne has returned to the Chamber, and taken charge of the amendment; and I should now like to say that when I undertook to submit it, in order that it might be placed before the Committee, I intimated that I did not quite agree with the proposal it embodied. However, the fact that such a proposal is made is evidence that the press in some parts of Australia is grossly unfair. No honourable member, especially a fighting member like the representative of Melbourne, would submit such an amendment unless there had been some gross abuse of the privileges of .the press. Weighing everything in the scales, however, I am of opinion that if we tried to protect ourselves by legislation, we should lose in the result. My experience is that the very best thing that can happen to a radical candidate is to have the whole of the conservative press against him. In Queensland we have always thought it a glorious privilege to Electoral [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill. exercise our public rights in such a way as to be denounced by the whole of the press. Indeed, most of our success in Queensland has been due to the fact that in many cases nine-tenths of the press have denounced the radical candidates. that 'the object I had in view has been fairly well achieved, and that I may rest content with the provision which has already been placed in the Bill, and which to a great extent covers the ground. The wording of my amendment might not be such as to best attain the end in view; but I point out to the Attorney-General that it would have placed a candidate in such a position that, if a newspaper wronged him, that newspaper would be compelled to publish his views in as prominent a place as was given to the attack. At present the only remedy is to send a letter to the editor, who may or may not publish it. If he does not throw it into the waste-paper basket, he inserts it in some obscure corner, unless the sender happens to be an important individual. Then, again, letters sent in this way are very often condensed to such an extent as to remove the true substance. Perhaps during the recess, the suggestion contained I in the proposed amendment may receive consideration, with good results in the future. I ask leave to withdraw the amendment. the amendment being withdrawn, in order to call attention before its withdrawal to the way in which honourable members in the corner are ""using the opportunity this Bill affords to advertise their particular pretensions to public favour. covery, because we have been witnesses of the undignified proceeding for several days.

481,Mr Kelly (Wentworth),"I am sur.to say a word or two on the serious side of this question. I believe that the honourable member for Kooyong has the very best intentions in submitting this amendment, but I would point out that he is asking us to vote certain privileges that will be peculiar to ourselves. Honourable members know that -'in connection with the question of the taxation of Federal incomes there has been considerable unrest and criticism among the people. Surely we do not desire to add to their just cause of complaint by deliberately voting to ourselves privilege's which will not ""be granted to the general public. It is not even proposed to extend the concession to 'candidates for elections to the States Parliaments. Members of those Legislatures would have a perfect right to ask, "" Why -should Federal members vote themselves privileges which are denied to us?"" The -same remark will apply to the position of candidates for election to municipal and district councils, as well as other public bodies. If the honourable member intends to be consistent, by proposing to extend this privilege to the general community, I shall be prepared to consider his proposition; but if .we -conferred these special privileges upon ourselves, we should subject ourselves to well-deserved criticism. I hope that the amendment will be rejected. not think that the honourable member for Fremantle has dealt quite fairly with this proposed new clause. The matter does not -concern me, since I so seldom change my views on any question that my Constituents nave them in a stereotyped form; but I -can quite understand that it is a matter of keen concern to some honourable members, who may change their views at every fresh -election. I have the greatest respect for the stability of the views of my honourable friend the member for Kooyong; but, as he represents a constituency which has a moving population, it becomes necessary for him, no doubjt, from time to time, to let them know, by means of addresses, what his views are on current topics. There is a very serious side to this proposal, and I think that the honourable member for Fremantle has quite missed the point. The honourable member for Kooyong does not wish to give Members of Parliament an ad vantage over other people. He has pointed out that it is possible to send through tbe post 20 ozs. of newspapers in bulk for i d . r point. One may take twenty newspapers to the post-office, weighing, an ounce each, and have them distributed over the country broadcast for i d . The honourable member for Kooyong merely contends that, for educational purpgses, the addresses of candidates for election to this Parliament are quite as valuable as newspapers, and should be distributed by the post-office at the same rates. I do not think that he is asking for a privilege; he merely desires that candidates shall be allowed to take advantage of the existing practice in regard to newspapers. Presumably, the ground upon which newspapers may be posted at such a cheap rate is that they contain at least a modicum of educational matter; and it is only fair to assume that the addresses of parliamentary candidates will do the same. I speak quite disinterestedly, because I am not likely to avail myself of the privilege, since my constituents do not need matter of this kind! orable member for Wentworth is under a misapprehension. The Post and Tele( graph Rates Act provides that the postage of newspapers shall be i d . for 20 ozs. aggregate weight, although each newspaper is in a separate wrapper. I do not look upon the proposal of the honourable member for""' Kooyong as anything veiy dreadful, but I would point out to the Committee that the object which he has in view could be achieved if he had his addresses printed in his local newspaper, and .then circulated. arrange.

Still. I see no objection to the insertion of this provision in the Bill. It is a very fair one, and will operate as usefully for one party as for another.

I do not know the view of the Postmaster General, but I can tell the House, that when this matter was discussed by the last Government, one of fhe points which I considered it to be my duty to bring before my colleagues was whether the revenue of the Department ought not to be increased by a contribution from the Electoral Branch of the Home Affairs Department. If the Post and Telegraph Department is made to bear more than its share of the electoral expenditure, it is evident that it will be a long time before we shall be able ito afford to concede penny postage to the people of Australia. If the Postmaster-General will look through this Bill, he will find that a large number of concessions have ""been granted, involving a considerable loss of revenue to his Department, not only in regard to the transmission of matter for parliamentary candidates, but also in respect of reductions in the cost of telegrams. These concessions must interfere seriously with the departmental business, as well as reduce the revenue. master-General made a calculation as to their probable effect? It has been suggested that the whole of the administrative work under this measure should be undertaken by the Post and Telegraph Department. If that view is to be adopted, it will mean further serious burdens upon the Department. the desirableness of bringing about pennypostage throughout Australia. that at present the revenue cannot bear the -strain. But every one of these concessions makes it more difficult to inaugurate that reform. What' steps are to be taken to recompense the Department for the large amount Of additional work that will be entailed upon it, and for the depletion of its revenue? These matters should receive the serious consideration of the Postmaster General. should like to learn from the Postmaster General whether it is intended to make higher payments to the various mail contractors throughout the Commonwealth who will have to carry all the literature that will be transmitted under the provisions which have just been inserted in this Bill? Is it intended to sweat the contractors in the interests of candidates for Parliament? I think it is an outrage that this kind of thing should be done. If we, as members ments, let us increase them in a direct way, not by side winds, by means of which we think the public will not know what we are doing. We ought not to pass laws which mean increasing the burdens on the people in this fashion. For my own part, I think that what we have done will be of very little advantage to candidates, though it will seriously decrease the revenue. I regret to say that the Bill has been debated throughout with the idea of securing more advantages to ourselves rather than from the point of view of increasing the public advantage.

523,Mr Cameron,"I desire that honorwill then understand that not only successful, but unsuccessful,. candidates are equally opposed to.petitions being heard in the future by the High Court. Nineteen months ago a general election was held, and in my candidature for the Denison seat I was defeated by twenty-eight votes. Finding that, in a number of instances, bribery had been used, I decided to petition against the .return of the successful candidate. I lodged my deposit of ,Â£50, and filed a petition df ten clauses, seven of which dealt distinctly with bribery, the remainder simply asking for a recount of the votes. After a considerable time the Chief Justice appointed a certain day on which it was to be heard. A short time before that day my opponent, through his solicitors, applied to the Chief Justice, in Chambers, in Sydney, to have seven clauses struck out of the petition, and His Honour gave me seven days in which to show cause why that should not be done. As it takes some days for the mail to reach Hobart, the result was that, when cause, he found that he could not get his objections lodged in time. As a matter of fact, the written objections which were posted immediately after we received the notice, reached Sydney twenty four hours after the Judge had ordered the clauses to be struck out. We found thar it was impossible to get bur objections there -in time, and we had to have recourse to the telegraph wire; but I need hardly point out that it is impossible for an advocate to be instructed as fo hTs case as fully by wire as in writing. Sir Samuel Griffith, who authorized the case to come before him in -chambers, also heard the case. 'ber mean to say that only seven days were allowed to send across to Tasmania? allowed after the application. -filed? -day of trial arrived, and Sir Samuel Griffith came to Hobart to preside at rhe hearing. When the case was called, Mr he might be examined. This, it must Lodge, my representative, rose to complain -of the manner in which we had been treated, pointing out that sufficient time had not been -afforded to prepare the case. To this Sir Samuel Griffith replied: "" I do not know why those clauses were struck out; they ought not to have been."" These were the words used by the very Judge who had himself ordered the clauses to be struck out. I can assure honourable members that every word I s,ay is absolutely true. able member's counsel say ? counsel say, except that the clauses had been struck out against his will ? Then Sir Samuel Griffith added, as an afterthought, that our Sydney representative had consented to that course; and my counsel retorted that if that were so, ourrepresentative had done so contrary to our express instructions, but that it could not be believed that he had so acted. Honourable members who paid some attention to the election petitions heard at that time may remember that Sir Samuel Griffith said that he had no power to deal with cases of bribery. When our caseâwas proceeding, he told my counsel and myself that, although he had no power to deal with a single case of bribery, if many rhy counsel had to show cases of bribery occurred, and could be proved, he had power to deal with them, and would do so. What was my position? The Judge had struck out the seven clauses on which I relied to prove my case, and then he coolly turned round and said that he had no power to deal with bribery. When it was originally proposed that the High Court should be the tribunal to hear election petitions I supported the idea, and in this connection I would like to remind honourable members of a certain provision in the original Electoral Act to the effect that any evidence, even if not strictly legal, which, was likely to lead to substantial justice being done, should be admitted. Sir Samuel Griffith, being a man of legal mind, absolutely refused to allow us to take advantage of that section. Just before the luncheon hour arrived on one day durgar in the witness-box, and proposed to examine him, but Sir Samuel Griffith would not allow that to be done. When the Court met after lunch, the Chief Justice decided The that if we could connect Seagar, who was the officer in charge of the Invalid Station, near Hobart, with the bribery, & c, be remembered, was after the Judge had refused point blank to allow us to examine Mr Seagar, although he was one of my most important witnesses in connection with the case then being investigated. My counsel must take responsibility for the fact",62,William Lyne Doe S Not The How I Stand I Understood That Any Honor

530,"Ing The Trial, My Counsel Placed Mr Sei;","that, although my principal witness had been present in Court from 10 o'clock in the morning until the adjournment for lunch, he had disappeared when the Court resumed. Thereupon, Sir Samuel Griffith said : "" I will give you an hour to find the witness, and if you can find him within that time, and can connect Mr Seagar with the bribery, I shall allow you to cross examine him."" I have no hesitation in saying, that if the investigation had been conducted by a Committee of this House, an adjournment would have been granted for a reasonable time, in order to enable us to find the witness, and compel him to give evidence, under the section to which I have referred. Hobart is a town of some 36.000 inhabitants, and of fairly large area; and, although we searched carefully, the witness could not be found within the hour which had been allowed. I ask honourable members to put themselves in my position, which may be theirs fourteen months hence. I am sure we all desire that substantial justice shall be done; and. if I can convince honourable members that justice was not done in my case, I think I may fairly ask them to reconsider the position. Then, we desired to investigate a large number of postal votes. The Chief Justice, however, declined to allow us to examine the flaps attached to them, to see whether the signatures corresponded, and therefore it was idle to proceed with the inspection. Judgment was entered against me, and I was saddled with costs. A little later, I left to attend to my parliamentary duties here, and immediately upon my arrival, feeling that I had been badly treated, I gave notice of a motion in favour of the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into all matters connected with the Denison petition. I did not for a moment entertain the idea that I could unseat the honourable member for Denison, but I desired to bring the subject before the Comto the fact that whilst my motion in favour mittee, so that Parliament might subsequently be afforded an opportunity to decide whether or not we ought to revert to the old system of referring all disputed elections to a parliamentary tribunal. barrister to forward the telegram and the letter of instructions to which I have referred, in order that I might be in a posihas a notice of motion upon the businesstion to prove my case. He ignored my request. In the short space of three months I wrote to him upon six occasions, and pergeneral reference to the cost of a disputed sonally saw him once. The only answer I got from him was that he was feeling unwell, an'd intended to leave for a holiday. He promised that upon his, return he would attend to the matter, but he failed to do so. I was, therefore, compelled to renew my notice of motion in regard to a parliamentary inquiry from time to time. It remained upon the business-paper for the whole of that session, and was renewed again this session. The election petition was heard on 18th April, 1903, and from the next day till 7th October, 1905, I was not asked to pay a single penny of my opponent's expenses. But a short time ago, in view of the large amount of Government business upon the paper, the Prime Minister moved that private members' business be set on one side for the remainder of the session. Only three or four days after that notice of motion appeared, I received the following telegram:Have just received documents which you better peruse. ShallI post to Bentley or Melbourne? Wire reply. The wire was signed by F. Lodge, who acted as my counsel. That telegram was followed within a few days by the following letter, which is dated Hobart, 9th October,^ 1905Dear Sir,-The document as to which we telegraphed you was the long delayed bill of costs of Sir Philip Fysh of the Denison election petition. We now post it you herewith for your perusal and observation. The total amount is ^185 gs.

535,Mr Speaker,"The honourable memCourt, but I do not think he is in order in discussing in detail the matters to which he refers. out that I am not now asking for the appointment of a Select Committee. I desire to impress upon honourable members the point that substantial justice cannot be -done as long as election petitions are dealt justice to be done them in connection with with by the High Court as a Court of Disputed Returns, instead of being referred to .an Elections and Qualifications Committee. I am bringing forward facts. ber will be quite in order in speaking on those lines. Even his notice of motion would not preclude him from doing so; but I fail to see what relation the point as to the date on which a bill of costs was rendered, as well as the other matters to which the honourable member was referring when I interrupted him, can have to the -question. nect them? member can do so, I shall have no more to say. orable members what a petition cost me, so that they may h'ave an idea of the -costs to which they may be subjected should they be concerned in an election dispute. ber will be perfectly in order in doing so; but that matter has no relation to the date when a certain bill of costs was delivered. not rendered for a year [and eight months. It was then taxed, and within twenty-four hours I received notice that ,if it were not immediately paid proceedings 'would be taken for its recovery. I wish to show honourable members that there is something very suspicious in connection with the case. I ilt may be constituted; my sole desire is am actuated only by one feeling. I have been through fhe mill, and have suffered. Two other honourable members have also been through the mill, and, notwithstanding that they have been successful, they agree with me that is is undesirable that election petitions should in future be dealt with by the High 'Court as a Court of Disputed Returns. That is the point that I wish to strongly impress upon honourable members. The Ministry, and particularly the Minister of Home Affairs, have taken up an attitude towards me that Is scarcely fair. The Minister in charge of the Bill did everything in his power to prevent me, at an earlier stage in the proceedings, from dealing with this question. I shall not say' that his action was due to the fact that he is a lawyer, or was prompted by any desire to prevent a slur 'being past upon the High Court; but if honourable members desire substantial any election dispute with which they may be concerned-if they desire to see the law, which is designed to secure purity of elections, carried out as it should be-the y will decline to allow electoral petitions to be dealt with by the High Court. tion to any but a wealthy man. concerned with the effect which this system may have upon a man's pocket; I am actuated by a far higher motive. I think that honourable members are desirous that the will of the electors shall be carried out, and that the intention of the law shall be observed. That being so, they should see that, when a petition is lodged on the ground that the law has been violated, the petitioner shall have fair play. that I did not have fair play. The only three honourable members capable of expressing an opinion on this question are unanimously against the continuation of the present system. I have endeavoured, as well as I can, to lay the matter before the House, and have no desire to trespass further upon its indulgence. Only one election petition was dealt with by the Elections and Qualifications Committee appointed by the first Parliament, and I believe that that tribunal did substantial justice. I favour the appointment of an Elections and Qualifications Committee, and do not care how to endeavour to benefit my fellow members. If I succeed in doing so, I shall feel that I have done something for the parliamentary institutions of Australia. I had proposed to move that the Bill be not read a third time until to-morrow, and to suggest that if the motion were agreed to, the Government should regard it as an intimation that the majority of the House were against the High Court being the Court of Disputed Returns. But as I understand that a satisfactory promise has been made in regard to this matter, I shall refrain from submitting such a motion.",64,William Lyne Doe S Not The How I Stand I Understood That Any Honor
