A subsidy was originally granted to tbe Independent Press Association, as it was considered that there should be available in Australia a supply of cable news independent of tbe only service then existing. The conditions have since changed, and a healthy competition in cable services now exists, which insures to all newspapers a f u l l service of cable news at a reasonable price. The continuance of the Government subsidy was therefore regarded as unnecessary. The subsidized association had, to the date of the notification of the cancellation of the subsidy, suspended its serupon notice1.

A t the time the Estimates were prepared, thc information in possession of the Department indicated that the estimate of £40,000 was a fair one. Later advances in costs of material and labour, and some modifications of plans brought about by changed conditions, necessitated a revision, bringing the amount to £80,000. 6. The responsibility cannot be placed upon individuals, as the change was caused by circumstances over which the Department had no control. 7.

If thc foregoing questions are answered in the affirmative, and if it is a fact that the preplaced the standard rate of interest at G sent standard "" proof-gallon,"" based on and developed by the British people through practical use, has stood the test of time, convenience, and adaptability to the trade, is the Prime Minister prepared to seriously entertain the proposals of tlie Advisory Council for Science and Industry? cil has, I understand, been making some investigations into the matter. ' No official recommendation has been made by them, but, if such recommendation is made, I shall consider it in the light of the honourable member's statements. WAR TI ME PROFITS TAX Debate resumed from 15th August (vide RESTThat this Bill be now read a second time. That after the word "" That,'""' the following words be inserted : "" in the opinion of this House the Bill is utterly inadequate, and signally fails 'to place upon wealth its due share of the expenses of the. war'"" > hard to imagine, in view of what we hear in the course of this discussion that there is really an amendment before the House.; indeed, I do not think that any amendment could have carried so libtle weight. The war ought to be prosecuted with as small a load of taxation as it is possible to place upon the taxpayer. According to the Treasurer, in his Budget statement, he has a reserve of something like £17,000,000 in hand for the purpose of meeting the expenses of the war; but the honourable members opposite are always urging the Government to extract the utmost farthing from the pockets of the taxpayers, although this must mean the disorganization of trade and business generally. Only last week I was speaking to an ex-member for Illawarra, who exwealth Government ought to accumulate something like £20,000,000 for this purpose. I think the Treasurer is showing his wisdom in raising the money as it is required, and not endeavouring to accumulate it to the disturbance of trade. The other day the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) contended that the Treasurer ought to adopt the Act passed by the British Parliament, which per cent, on private individuals, and 7 per cent, in the case of companies. It has to be pointed out, however, that in the Old Country the rate of interest is very much lower than it is here. In Australia, if we. require to borrow money for the purposes of our businesses, we have to pay a much higher rate for the accommodation. Apart from that. I find that, only last June, at the instance of Mr Bonar Law, an amendment was made in the BritishA c t , which raised the standard rate of interest from 6 per cent, to 9 per cent, for individuals, and 10 per cent, for companies, and this I regard as a very high compliment to our own Treasurer. I agree to a certain extent with the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr. Fenton) in his contention that taxation on profits made owing tb the war can be passed on to the consumer. There is no doubt that if a business man has to pay 50 per cent.' in the way of extra taxation, it is a very easy matter to him ito add a small and almost imperceptible amount to his prices, so that, in the case of a big turnover, the purchaser may be made to pay the imposition. But the honourable member has shown us no remedy for this state of things, which he knows has prevailed from the time of Adam. He condemns the present Government, but ignores the fact that the previous Government, of which he was a supporter, did not deal with this octopus. Then, again, the honourable member for BarrierC Mr Considine) has had a lot to say on the subject of BrokenH ill : but, he, too, has failed to support his charges against",6,Alcohol Pebcentages

I have only to refer to the sugar industry to show how fair this exemption is. In 1915-16, owing to drought, only about 50 p'er cent, of the crop was realized, not sufficient, in most instances, to pay working expenses. In 1916-17, in many cases, no crop was harThese vested on account of the Dickson award; and now, when a better crop than ever before is expected, to take 50 per cent, of the profits would be downright robbery Surely these tributed over the three years, I think it would be found that the sugar growers have not made 10 per cent., or anything like it , on the average; indeed, they have had to borrow ""money over two years, in the hope of redeeming themselves in the third year.

When I was a member of the State Parliament of Queensland, and an attempt was made to fix prices, the Price Fixing Board made some very unjust awards, based on the cost at which one f i r m could land goods. The Board had the right to inspect books; and it was found that, in the case of one firm, goods were imported from , and wool and other produce exported to, Great Britain. The firm was able to save exchange both ways, and did not insure at the then price of 10 per cent., but took the risk themselves. The consequence was that they were enabled to land their goods in Queensland at a very low price. There were other firms which had no such arrangement Queensland, and they had to pay both . exchange and insurance. These firms purchased goods probably at the same price as did„the other f i r m , but they had to find a certain percentage of the cash in London, with the balance to be paid by deferred payments; and the which negotiated the drafts took care to see that the .goods were insured at the prevailing rates. The insurance and the exchange had to be added to the cost; and honourable members w ill see how unjust the position became. Many firms refused to sell goods at less than cost price, -as they were asked to do by the Price Fixing Board; and the result was that, while some country storekeepers could not get goods, others had to face the difficulty of paying absolute net cash, and also to impose cash conditions on primary producers to whom they had been, accustomed to give credit between If crops. The Leader of the Opposition and other honourable members have, at some length, In one Department, viz., the produced figures showing the profits made by companies trading in Australia during the last three years. It is to be noted, however, that we are not informed If , for in whether additional capital has been put into these businesses, or whether two businesses have been combined, when naturally larger profits would be shown. Such figures as have been produced, in stead of assisting the House, are only misleading. We should have heen informed of the capital invested in tlie various businesses, and what percentage the profits bear to that capital. All these figures put into Hansard mean nothing to the business man, but the outside community, many of whom know nothing of financial affairs, imagine that unreasonable profits are being made. If the -truth were known it might be seen that the firms have not received even the 10 per cent, exempted under the B ill , and, in many instances, not 5 per cent. _ I suggest to the Treasurer that the l i m it of thirty days, in which payment has to be made, is very short, and that it would avoid inconvenience if it were extended to three or four months.

As an instance of what I mean, I was informed the other day that some firms engaged in making agricultural machinery in Australia had a three years' supply 1 of steel purchased at pre-war rates. Even if those firms were making big profits before the war by turning out by reason of the advantageous, Again, there 1914. 1917. £ s. £ s.

Although his capital was small, he might be of .that class of man who is worth £1 000 per annum 7 : in any industry upon whioh he embarks on his own account. He may make £2,000 or £3,000 profit, and, as he had no pre-war standard of profits, and his capital being infinitesimal, this B ill w ill deprive him practically of all the f r u it s of his industry or his opportunities. Personally, I do not think that in a War-time ProfitsB ill there is the slightest justification for any exemptions as exemptions. But exemptions may possibly be justified for the reason that it is utterly impossible to fix a standard of comparison that w ill enable certain industries to be included without manifest injustice. Take the farming class, for instance. As a farmer myself, I see no reason why those of us who combine grazing and grain-growing should be exempt from the operations of this tax. that the average share-farmer, pr small wheat farmer, after allowing interest at the rate of 10 per cent, on the amount of capital invested in his enterprise in pre-war years, and deducting labour and other charges, would show no profit at all. But if it can be shown that farmers have made a profit, there is no reason why they should be exempt. WhatI am particularly interested in is the point raised by the honourable member for Calare( Mr Pigott) in regard to the basic principle upon which we are to get the exemption of 10 per cent. Clause 16, in defining "" Capital,"" says, "" The amount of the capital of a business shall be taken to be the amount of its capital paid up by the owner in money or in kind."" would have the effect of bringing about a result which, perhaps, I can best express by mentioning a concrete example. Sup1 pose that A , w i th his family, is the original holder of 5,000 acres of land acquired from the Crown at £1 per acre, held, perhaps, for the last t h i r ty or for t y I fail to see why professional men and ^ years, and having on it improvements in buildings, fencing, ring-barking, clearing, <Ssc, worth another £ 1 per acre. If I correctly interpret clause 16, such a man woxtld be allowed only £10,000 as the capital upon which to base his claim for a 10 per cent, exemption. Eveni f stock had been bred on the property, as is usually the case, there is no provision, that I can see, for including the value of that stock. Mr Lynch. thousand pounds would be the basis upon which the exemption would be calculated. On the other hand, a settler who purchased on a walk-in walk-out basis a similar holding, stocked in the same way, for £20,000, would be entitled to 10 per cent, on that £20,000. If the £200 exemption added to the 10 per cent, basis were allowed and the 50 per cent, profit to be taken under this B ill for the 1915-16 quota, then the original holder, who had selected at £ 1 per acre, would pay about £250I am assuming a £2,000 profit in the year 1915-16-and on the same basis the man who had purchased on the walk-in walkout basis at £ 4 per acre, would not have to pay one penny until he could show a profit of £2,500. I am confident that the Treasurer will avoid any uncertainty in this matter by inserting definite proviDoubtless it would be easy to show sions in the Bil l itself. It is all very well to leave definitions to officers administering the Act. but we know from experience that even the capable and disinterested men administering the Federal Income Tax Act are bound by the law as they interpret it . Dnder the Income Tax Act, in the case of a man on the land, the value of his stock is set down as the price at which he purchased it , but he must credit in his account sales the actual prices realized for that stock. Apart from the deduction allowed in respect of moneys borrowed on the property itself no deduction can be made in respect of the capital 1 invested in the grass and water which enabled the increased value to be put into his stock from the time that .they were purchased or dropped until he disposed of them. These are principles which, to my That definition mind, need to be very carefully defined, and in view of his long and varied experience in public life, I feel confident that the Treasurer will see that they are. Coming to the question of exemptions, if this is to be a war-time profits measure others should be exempt where it can be clearly shown that their increased returns since the war are due to the war or to circumstances which have developed in consequence of it , I do not think that the provisions of this B ill could be fairly applied to members of Parliament. The suggestion .made some time ago by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlj ton) that an all-round deduction from inTen comes should be made would be a much better way of taxing, so to speak, the salaries of honourable members. By doing something in that direction we should give hostages to our sincerity in this matter. an honourable member makes much out of his £600 a year. he makes nothing out of it ; but it would not do to introduce the card system w it h the object, of out seems to me that while a few honourable members, as Ministers, are almost worked to death, others are doing their best to see that they are properly crushed W i th theoutbreak of war many of us thought that some such action as I have suggested would be taken. It was then that the honourable' member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) suggested that neither members of Parliament nor any one else in the community should be allowed an income of more than £200 a year-that all earnings in excess of that amount should go to the State. A fte r all, he was merely voicing a suggestion made by a gentleman in New South Wales who is not usually associated with very advanced forms of thought. I "" refer to Mr Abbott, of Wingen, who suggested that all salaries be reduced to £200 . I could not support such a proposition, because I believe that if the incomes of those who enjoy £10,000 a year were reduced to £200 per annum, we should have thrown on our hands hosts of people who in some way or other derive a living from the extravagances or the expenditures of such men. Even at this, the eleventh hour, however, we should take some determined action to prevent men, whether they he. engaged in commercial or manufacturing pursuits or in primary industries, making huge profits. there are many difficulties in the way, make the effort rather than to attempt the impossible, ' as the Government are now doing. the payment of a fair proportional amount on the part of every individual who, wittingly or unwittingly, has profited on ac. count of the war or during war time.. Attempts have been made to show that there is no foundation for the complaints we hear on every hand as to the profiteering that is going on. As. a man who makes his livin g by growing wheat, meat, and wool, I say distinctly that the consumers'of Australia are not being f a i r l y treated. Our systems lend themselves to wholesale robbery. Notwithstanding that we live in I do not t h in k that a country filled with the primary necessities of every-day existence, conditions are developing that make it harder and My experience is that harder for the people to gain sustenance. Whether he be producing on a large or a small scale, I have no sympathy with the finding, man who insists that, even in these abwhat we are all doing. It normal times, he should not be called upon to make any sacrifice, and that his every effort shall be paid for according 'to the highest standards Such a man gives us one of the worse exhibitions of the goslow or don't-go-at-all policy. Nor have I any sympathy with the man who thinks he can better his position by refusing to give an honest day's work for an honest day's pay. It is essential that the community should do for individuals what they cannot do for themselves. While I hold that it is impossible, by a measure of this kind, to stop profiteering, I realize at the-same time that the Government are bound to give effect to their pledge to the people. When the B ill shall have been ultimately passed, I hope that it will afford some measure of relief, and do something to assist in developing in Australia the truly patriotic spirit which is best expressed by -people in every walk of life making sacrifices, foregoing profits, and so assisting in every way to tide the Commonwealth over the disastrous times through which we are passing. However much this effort to bring about such a situation may fal l short of its object, if it only does something in that direction it will meet with the approval of the people. I do not agree with those who say that the B ill should be dropped, and I admit that that an increased income tax should be levied. There are in Australia to-day but it would be better to numberless people who are deriving pretty fair incomes, which are already coming under the heavier proportional rates of We should exact taxation. They are paying such taxation notwithstanding that they are not securing any increased emoluments in consequence of or during the war. On the contrary, their expenses owing to the increase in the cost of living have gone up. An era of extravagance has come upon the people. We are like children revelling in to-day, utterly regardless of what the morrow may bring forth . .",17,Assessment Bill Second Reading

181,Mr Wise (Gippsland) [?.30],"I toperate unfairly in many cases, the , framers of the B ill endeavoured to avoid unfairness, as much as possible, by inserting conditions and exemptions, and it is in dealing with them that so much of the trouble has arisen. If we approve of the principle of the Commonwealth acquiring as much of the war-time profits as it can, we should, instead of voting for the amendment, and so rejecting the B ill , t r y to get the measure into Committee, and-there amend it in such a way that it will achieve the object we have in view. Personally, I think that many of the exemptions should be struck out. If we could get hold of the actual war profits I would have no hesitation in supporting a proposal that the Commonwealth should take the lot of them, but the difficulty consists in arriving at what are war profits. The honourable member for In d i ( Mr Leckie) was a little unfair when he said that this B ill differed, as regards the beginning of the accounting period, from the B i ll introduced by the honourable Looking at the memorandum showing the amendments which this B ill makes on the War-time Profits Tax Assessment B ill of 1916, I find that the first few lines of clause 7 are exactly the same, namelyThere shall be levied and paid on the amount by which the profits arising from any business to which this Act applies, in any accounting -period ending after the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and fifteen, The honourable member also said that the honourable member for Capricornia had objected to retrospective legislation. This is what the former Treasurer said, and if his remarks were applicable to his own B ill they are much more applicable todayIn the United Kingdom, the War Profits Bill was passed in 1915, and covered the first eleven months of the war. The Government do not -propose to tax the profits accruing during that period, because the firms and companies have, probably, in all cases, distributed their profits,"" and it might cause a very great deal of irritation if we now demanded that they should make good those profits. That is very sensible in not to tax the profits for the year 1914, and I am all the more surprised that a member of the Government whose Treasurer enunciated that view should propose to make' the Bill retrospective so as to tax the profits earned in 1914. I shall vote against the amendment Bill, and I hope that in Committee it Mr Wise. will be so amended as to achieve the object which we all desire. Question-That the words proposed to amendment)-put .
