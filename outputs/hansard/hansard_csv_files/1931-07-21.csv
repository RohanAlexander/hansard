0,"House Of Representatives. Tuesday, 81 July, 1931. Cook The Chair At 3 P.m., And Offered Prayers. New South Wales Finance . Ter) [3.2]","by leave-Afte r an interview with the Premier of New South Wales yesterday regarding the financial necessities of his State, I sent the following telegram to all members of the Loan Council:Following is summary of letter dated 15th .July, received by Commonwealth Treasurer from Premier and Treasurer of New South Wftles: During recent conference of Premiersi t was generally understood that, providing governments £40,000,000 to £15,000,000, banks would carry respective governments during current financial year. Assuming deficits are reduced to £15,000,000, leeway w ill be greater during first half of year, and, consequently, greater accommodation than £15,0.00,000 w i ll be required between J u l y and December, but accommodation so provided w ill be lessened during second half of year. I am enclosing estimate of receipts and expenditure of New South Wales for period 1st July to 30th September, from which it w ill be seen that, apart fro m non-payment of London exchange and interest and the amounts withheld by the Commonwealth from this State, we w ill require approximately £500,000 during July, furthe r £2,000,000 during August, and further £1,000,000 during September. Amount for August includes local interest amounting to over £750,000 due on 10th August. In order to meet this it w ill be necessary to obtain substantial proportion of August requirements early during t h a t month. Present position of this State is that unless £500,000 is provided immediately we w ill be unable to pay salaries and wages next week. Salary pay day falls 23rd July, but wages have to be paid practically every day. I have approached general managers of Bank of New South Wales and Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, but they point out that arrangement is that accommodation required by any government must be dealt w it h through Commonwealth Bank by issue of Commonwealth treasury-bills. In view of foregoing I shall be glad if you could assist this State by arranging, if possible, for issue of treasury-bills i o the extent of £500,000 within next few davs, and further amount of £2,000,000 in August, of which £1,000,000 w ill he required before 10th of that month. In regard to debt conversion, over £4,000,000 matures in this State on 10th August. I am inclined to think many holders w ill seek repayment, and this is a question which w ill require your earnest consideration as it is impossible for the State to pay off any portion of the loan. To-day, at consultation w it h Mr Lang, I informed him Commonwealth itself has no moneys available for loan to any State, but is itself borrowing from its bankers. I also pointed out that, as set out in resolutions of Loan Council meeting of 26th February last, provision of funds for advances to any State is a matter for Loan Council and not for Commonwealth Government; also that Loan Council had declared it could not arrange further borrowing on behalf of New South Walesu n t i l it is clear the State is prepared to honour its interest obligations. I undertook to submit present request of New South Wales for funds to Loan Council, together w it h any information likely to assist members of Loan Councili n coming to decision. In regard to plan adopted by Premiers Conference, Premier of New South Wales states he proposes introducing this week legislation coverreduced deficits fro m ing conversion agreement, trustees and private interest, and at earliest possible moment, legislation providing for economies in expenditure. This latter would be on lines indicated' at Premiers Conference, namely, reduction to",10,Setup

Premier alBO advised he would submit to his Cabinet and party, question of New South Wales rejoining Loan Council, and question of New South Wales assuming responsibility for payment of interest oversea. 1 consider it essential that meeting of Loan Council be held at early date to consider questions arising out of Premier's letter and my conference with him; but, pending that meeting, early decision is desired whether Loan Council will approve issue of treasury-bills for £500,000 to cover immediate requirements of New South Wales. If Loan Council so approved, CommonwealthBank would be approached with view to seeing whether, in conjunction with other banks, it would arrange sale of treasury-bills for £500,000 for Government of New South Wales. Immediately I receive advice from Premier of -New South Wales regarding the two questions on which he is consulting Cabinet and party, I will again communicate with you. This telegram has been seen by Mr Lang. for Chairman, Loan Council. I am now awaiting f u r t h e r advice from Mr Lang. peated statement that the Premier of New South Wales is asking for assistance from the Commonwealth Government, w ill the Prime Minister say whether it is not a fact that Mr Lang is merely asking the .Commonwealth to discount treasury bills issued by the Government of New South Walesf o r which that Government .will be responsible? describes the situation, but the treasury bills must be issued in the name of the Commonwealth Government, which w ill be legally responsible for their payment. The Commonwealth Government w ill be in exactly the same position in relation to such bills as it is to the consolidated State debts; it w ill be responsible for the return of the principal and the payment of interest. This Government is not prepared to assume any f u r t h e r responsibility in regard to New South Wales, u n t i l Mr. Lang indicates his readiness to accept responsibility for past as well as for futur e loans. Minister assure the House that, as a representative of the Commonwealth on the Loan Council he w ill not agree to any moneys being made available to New South Walesu n t i l certain' specific legislation has been actually introduced into the Parliament of that State. ance from tlie Premier of New South Wales yesterday that that legislation would be commenced to-day, and 1 am now waiting to hear what legislation is to be introduced. I have sent to the other Premiers a telegram to-day, pointing out that the successful launching of the Conversion Loan w ill be greatly prejudiced if the legislation for the plan is not proceeded w it h , and carried immediately. I urged that it was most important that all bills in a l l State Parliaments should be passed through a l l stages this week. for Markets whether the rejection by the farmers of New South Wales of the proposed State wheat pool w ill affect the Government's intentions regarding the Wheat Marketing B ill? Wheat Marketing B ill only requires the consent of three States to the establishment of a Commonwealth wheat pool. wheat pool ballot in New South Wales be taken by this Government as an expression of the opinion of the farmers of that Statei n respect to the Commonwealth honourable member's question shall receive my close consideration.

I ask the Prime Minister whether that statement is correct, and how often the Leader of the Opposition has been in this chamber since he usurped his position? whether, as Prime Minister, I should answer that question. I have not seen the paragraph referred to. The Leader of the Opposition, like the leaders of all political parties, no doubt is claiming as much credit as he can for his own party for the passage of legislation. 1 must acknowledge that the Opposition assisted the Government in passing the emergency legislation quite as ably as did the members of my own party. give consideration to the serious disability imposed under tfhe Sales Tax Assessment Acts, upon houses that are both wholesale and retail-particularl y in South Australia and Western Australiawhich has been brought about by treating the proprietors of such houses as wholesalers only, where the greater proportion of the trade is wholesale in character?

We shall be able to discuss such details when the bill is at the committee stage. ter yet given consideration to the request of the Fishermen's Co-operative Association, South Brisbane, that canned fish It is not the should be exempt from the provisions of the sales tax?

I understand that the Victorian Municipal Association has already written to the Treasurer on this matter. be considered when the bill is before the chamber. A considerable number of exemptions have been granted to both State governments and municipal authorities, and the result has been that we have had to increase the rate of tax by 1 per cent, in order to obtain the required revenue. The greater the exemption we give, the higher must be the rate of tax; or, alternatively, the greater the increase in the income tax. Minister have compiled, if it has not already been done, a list showing the number of licences issued since the 30tb June last? ticulars have been compiled almost to date, showing the licences issued, and the different classes entitled to them, under the new preferential system.

Orders have been issued to the effect, "" that costs and home requirements must be disregarded. F r u it means foreign currencyRussia's most vital need."" The Russians hope that dumping will remove the competition, at least of Australian dried fruits from the market next season.

Railway bookings in certain States can be made only twice weekly. a forecast. When 'we get through the essential emergency legislation, we can, I think, adjourn for four weeks. During most of that time the conversion of the Commonwealth loans will be taking place, and subsequently there will have to be meetings of the Loan Council and a Premiers Conference to consider the result of the conversion, and other matters arising out of it. That will occupy the period for which the House will be adjourned. If we bend our energies to this end, .the House should be able to rise some time towards the end of next week, and it might be possible for honourable members, by throwing greater energy into their work, to so expedite business as to enable it to rise at the end of this week. I do not propose, however, that the work shall be scamped, or that undue pressure shall be put on honourable members by a series of all-night sittings, because the legislation that we are passing is imrule, quite enough. about the tariff? rise for four weeks, and then to resume to clear up matters arising out of the loan conversion, and afterwards to deal with the tariff.

The session has been long drawn-out, but we are living in abnormal times. The Debt Conversion Bill has to be proclaimed. It cannot be proclaimed until we get the Debt Conversion Agreement, which I hope to bring down to-day. We are waiting to hear from the Premier of Western Australia before we can go ahead. There are various bills arising out of the budget, the sales tax and income tax legislation particularly, to be passed. There is also a small amendment of the Gold Bounty Act; the bill providing for it will be introduced in a few moments. The Attorney-General has a small amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to introduce, and we have also to pass the Wheat Marketing Bill. going on with that? Markets will explain why. The resolution dealing with dominion legislation must be passed. I gave notice to-day of a small amendment to the Public Service Act, but that should go through in a few minutes.

34,Mr Scullin,"-The Minister forMrJ ONES I am still receiving protests from my constituents against the importation of Russian timber into Australia, and, as the Minister for Trade and Customs has promised to make a f u l l inquiry into the matter, will he state what stage this inquiry has reached? the value of timber imported from Russia have not yet arrived. The timber is not being offered for sale, and security to the amount of 10s. per 100 superficial feet has been demanded by the department. Instructions have been issued that delivery of the timber is not to be given until I have been consulted; so that the industry has no reason to be apprehensive. The Government will see that the Australian timber industry is adequately protected. move some uncertainty at present existing, will the Prime Minister, seeing that the Financial Emergency Act has been proclaimed on a datebetween two pay days, state whether the reduction of salaries, pensions, &c, will apply for the whole of the period covered by the pay, or whether the reduction will be on a pro rata basis from the date of proclamation? pared on the assumption that the reduction would be made on the pay day following the proclamation of the act. It is obvious that some of the provisions of the act could not be brought into operation later than others, and a delay of a fortnight would involve a loss of revenue amounting to £200,000. Therefore, the reductions will apply to Public Service salaries, pensions, &c, on the first pay day after the proclamation of the act. In. the case of salaries, the next pay day is Friday, and the reductions will apply to the whole period covered by that pay. for Customs noticed a report in the press of a speech by Mr Baldwin at Hull, in which he said thatHe had made up his mind that he would not be head of a government which was "" going was carrying our deficit'a thing which to make Great Britain a profiteer's paradise or parliament a crooks' corner,."" ""We must make the tariff ' knave-proof' as far as possible,"" he said. "" Therefore, it is essential that the scientific adjustment and adaption of the tariff should be taken from the hands of politicians by the establishment of a permanent non-political tariff commission, the members of which ought to be lifted as fur above party politics as His Majesty's judges."" In view of this statement will the Minister favourably consider the appointment of a permanent commission, free of party bias? If not, does he consider that Mr Baldwin has been unduly optimistic in suggesting the possibility of removing tariff questions from political influence. paragraph quoted by the honourable member; but I have read other newspaper paragraphs purporting to contain the remarks of eminent statesmen of Great Britain-remark s that were to the effect that in their opinion the time had arrived when a little protection would be a good thing for industry in that country. As for the appointment of a tariff commission, I may inform the honourable member that I was so sickened by the multitude of commissions, committees, and boards, numbering 58 in all, which were appointed by the last Government at a cost of £600,000 that I would not consider the appointment of any others. of the Prime Minister, an essential feature of the rehabilitation plan that the banks shall meet the Government deficits during the current financial year ? If so, does the scheme involve all the banks, the Commonwealth Bank acting in conjunction with them and on their behalf, and is there any limit to the amount of the deficits which the banks will carry? ment that the Commonwealth Bank, working in conjunction with the other banks, shall carry the Government deficits for this year; but there is, decidedly, a limit to the amount. We were warned, in the first place, that the limit would be reached by the end of June, when the amount would be £25,000,000. At that time the Commonwealth Bank",13,Parliamentary Adjournment

By the end of June we had reached the limit. During the Premiers Conference in Melbourne the banks agreed that they would continue to carry government deficits if we did not exceed the limit set at that time, which included the £30,000,000 accumulated deficit for last year, which was to be carried until it could be funded as a long-dated loan, and the sum of £14,000,000 or £15,000,000, the estimated deficit for all Australian governments for this financial year. Other conditions were laid down by the banks with regard to the issue of treasury-bills, and there are conditions also to be observed under the Financial Agreement, which is supervised by the Loan Council. CASE OF JACOB JOHNSON. of the Attorney-General to the newspaper report of a meeting of the Trades Hall Council in Melbourne, at which the Jacob Johnson case was considered, which passed the following resolution:That the Argus he informed that its subleader of yesterday is false in substance, and speeches to be delivered at a meeting to apparently designedly prejudicial, inasmuch as there was documentary evidence in the Crown Law Department that Mr Latham, then Federal Attorney-General, withheld very important material facts from Parliament at that time. Is there any evidence at all, or any foundation whatever, for the statement that I , as Attorney-General withheld important material facts, or any material facts, from Parliament at any stage. member withheld or suppressed material facts, he must have done it very successfully, because I have no information on the subject, and I have no reason to believe that there is the slightest foundation for the allegation said to have been made by Mr Clarke, of the Seamen's TJnion. May I add that the same gentleman has made, and promulgated a series of quite unfounded, wild, and irresponsible statements about myself so that honours are equal between the present Attorney-General and his predecessor in that high office. Relative to the honourable member's question is a statement by the Argus, that the inquiry proposed to be held is likely to be entirely vexatious and useless, or words to that effect. The Argus is not in a position to know what the matters are about which inquiry is to take place, and its judgment in that regard is ill-informed and premature. THE ESTIMATES. Estimates be printed? Time could be saved if honourable members had an opportunity of perusing them some time before they are considered in committee.

It has not been possible to have them printed earlier than Wednesday; but as soon as they are to hand, they will be distributed. I direct the attention SPEECHES. Postmaster-General( Mr A.

What are the reasons for this refusal, in view of the fact that permission was given for the broadcasting of speeches made in Adelaide recently by the Premier of New South Wales, or his representative, and by the Treasurer, myself, and others, discussing political topics? Why has this permission been refused to the the honourable Citizens' League to broadcast through a "" B "" class station, and is it possible, even at this stage, to give authority for the broadcasting of it? with the facts of the case.

An executive committee of the council to be formed from the "" industry"" members with such powers and functions as the council decides. Although some honourable members who arc enthusiastic advocates of the encouragement of the gold-mining industry sincerely believe that such a council should be established, and can, no doubt, advance good reasons in support of their belief, the Government felt that under existing conditions it would not be justified in incurring the heavy expense that would be involved in the setting up of such a body. The Trade and Customs Department, which is responsible for the administration of our bounty legislation, will be able to -do all the necessary work in connection with the payment of the gold bounty and the checking of claims without setting up an outside body to be financed out of the Treasury payments for bounty. ment has been promised tbe active co-operation of the Mines Departments of the various States. In these circumstances, it will not be necessary to engage any additional staff to administer this legislation. If a gold council were established and were authorized to retain 5 per cent, of the gold bounty, it would Mr Forde. have an income of £10,000 per annum, assuming that if the payment of gold bounty at the rate of £1 per ounce, involved an expenditure of £200,000, and of £5,000 if it involved an expenditure of £100,000 at the rate of 10s. per ounce. Such a body would doubtless need to call for the assistance of the mining inspectors of the various State Governments. Tho Government has been promised all the assistance that the State Mines Departments can give it in connection with the administration of this legislation, and able to inspect mines and/ report upon them, and to do anything else that might bo necessary in this direction. The Minister for Trade and Customs, and the Comptroller-General of ^ Customs, will both be able to arrange with the State Governments for the assistance of the State mining officers. [Quorum formed.'] It has been found that several amendments of the act are desirable. The amendments now proposed do not affect volve matters concerning its practical application. In the first place, it is urgently necessary that the definition of "" licensed gold buyer "" should be extended. The present definition reads "" licensed gold buyer means a person authorized under the law of a State or territory to buy gold "". The effect of this is that in a State where there is no law authorizing persons to buy gold there are no licensed gold buyers for the purposes OJ this act. The only States which, up to the present, have such a law are Victoria and Western Australia, so that in the other States, until the definition is amplified, there can be no licensed gold buyers to whom producers can sell their gold and obtain there for the certificates required to enable bounty to be claimed. This disability could be overcome by the Parliaments of New South Wales and The GovernQueensland passing legislation to provide for the licensing of gold buyers, similar to the acts . in Western Australia and Victoria, but as they have not taken that action it is deemed advisable that this Parliament should make the necessary provision. The amendment proposed will overcome this difficulty, as banks and others operating in States to which the present definition does not extend can be specified by the Minister as licensed gold buyers for the purposes of the act. It is because of the urgency for action in this direction that the bill is now brought forward. The words proposed to be added to the definition are:and includes any branch in Australia of His Majesty's Royal Mint and any authority of a State specified by the Minister by notice published in the Gazette, or any person so specified. This will enable a storekeeper or State official if needed to be appointed a gold buyer in a centre where there is no branch of a bank. This matter was brought to my notice by several members, notably the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan), who pointed out that many places in his electorate have no banks, but gold could be sold there if local storekeepers or other reliable persons were appointed licensed gold buyers under the Gold Bounty Act. As to the reference to the branches of the Royal Mint, I may say that specific mention of these in the definition is necessary. There is a branch in Melbourne and one in Perth. They do not, however, come under the present definition, as they are not authorized by the law of the State to buy gold, but operate under British law. It is of course necessary that they should be "" licensed gold buyers"" for bounty purposes. The second amendment is the addition of a definition of a "" tributer"". Later amendments make reference to tributers, and it is therefore desirable that tributers should be defined. The definition reads"" T r i b u t e r "" means a person who works a mine or portion of a mine under an agreement with the lessee or owner of the mine to pay to, or receive from, the lessee or. owner, a portion or percentage of the product taken from the mine, or of the proceeds of the sale of that product. , The third amendment is to paragraph c of sub-section 3 of section 3. This section how provides that gold contained in material shipped abroad for treatment that tributers participate equally with the shall be deemed to have been produced owners of the mine in any bounty on in the year in which it was so shipped. gold resulting from their labours. Before such gold can be considered for According to the nature of the agreement bounty it is, of course, necessary that satbetween the tributer and the owner or isfactory evidence be furnished as to the actual quantity of gold recoverable from the material. Such evidence may not, however, be available in the same year in which the material was shipped; in any such case, it is desirable that there should be authority for the gold to be brought into the accounts of the year in which the evidence is furnished. Otherwise the settlement of the bounty claima promptly after the close of any year might be seriously delayed. To provide for this the addition of the following words to the section is proposed:or, where a shipper has not, in the year in_ which shipment is effected, furnished evidence to tlie satisfaction of the Minister as to the quantity of the gold commercially recoverable from such matte, concentrates, or other material, as the case may be, the gold shall, if the Minister so directs, be deemed to have been shipped in the year in which such evidence is produced. The next amendment-that to section 7 of the act-is associated with that just mentioned. The proviso to section 7 requires the production of an assay certificate of the value and content of the gold in material shipped abroad for treatment. The quantity of gold in such material is not, however, necessarily the quantity of gold which is commercially recoverable from the material, and bounty should not, of course, be payable on a quantity in excess of that recoverable. The amendment to this section, therefore, is to require an assay certificate as to the gold content of the material, and, in addition, evidence as to the quantity of gold commercially recoverable. The next amendment is to section 8, and is to make clear that bounty will be paid only in respect of gold for which claims for bounty have been lodged, and, so far as gold in material shipped abroad is concerned, in respect of gold commercially recoverable, which may be less than the gold actually contained in the material. A new section-is proposed to be inserted after section 9 for the purpose of ensuring lessee of the mine the tributer may be entitled to the gold he obtains-in which case he would pay a share to the mineowner or lessee-or , on the other hand, the gold obtained may go to the owner or lessee, who would pay a proportion to the tributer. In the latter case the tributer should receive from the mineowner or lessee a. share of any bounty paid in respect of the gold concerned, and it is to make this clear that the section is added to the act.. The new section provides that where a gold mine or portion of a gold mine is worked by ,a tributer, the owner of the treatment plant at which gold from the ore produced by the tributer is recovered, shall pay to the tributer 50 per cent, of any bounty received in respect of the gold obtained from such is urged by the Tributers Association of Western Australia. The views of the Chamber of Mines, Kalgoorlie, were sought. The chamber, in the first place, raised no objection, but within the last few weeks has advised that the matter has been reconsidered, and that it now opposes legislation on the lines suggested. The chamber states that this decision is in accordance with the cabled views of the London Board of Directors of Western Australian gold-mining companies. Mr de Bernales, who has been most actively interested in the bounty, has all along strongly opposed this amendment to protect the interests of the tributers. The Australian Workers Union of Boulder, Western Australia, which has also been consulted in the matter, agrees with the suggested provision. tive of the proportion the tributers are to receive under agreement? drawn up independently of this bounty. Some persons have said that, because of this new provision, the mine-owner will drive a harder bargain when letting tributes, but that is not a matter within the purview of this bill. The tributers in Western Australia are responsible for the production of over 100,000 oz. of gold annually, and their interests in the matter are, therefore, considerable. The Postmaster-General( Mr A. Green) knows the circumstances of the tributers in the PARKHILL ) adjourned. Kalgoorlie district very well, and he has represented to me their views. Moreover, the State Mining Act provides that 50 per cent, of any premium on gold is to be paid to tributers, and it is considered equally desirable that their rights in respect of the bounty should be similarly ensured. Minor amendments are made to sections 11 and 18 to cover work done by tributers, and at the end of section 18 an additional sub-section is inserted. Sub-section 6 of section 18 authorizes the Minister to appoint in certain circumstances an authority for determining conditions of labour and rates of wages. It is desirable that the nature of this authority should be defined, to ensure particularly that such authority is repreore. This provision sentative of both employers and employees. The proposed new sub-section is in the same terms as sub-sections in recent bounty acts, notably those relating to cotton, flax, and linseed, and reads(7.) An authority appointed by the Minister under the last preceding sub-section shall consist of a representative of employers engaged in the production of gold, a representative of employees engaged in such production, and a person, who shall act as chairman, and who shall be appointed by the Minister on the joint nomination of the representatives of employers and employees: Provided that if the representatives of employers and employees fail to make a joint nomination of a chairman within twenty days of being called upon by the Minister to do so, the Governor General may appoint a person to act as chairman. The last amendment is to the schedule to the act, prescribing the form of application for registration as a gold producer. In the application, certain undertakings are given by the applicant, which bind him for ten years-the full term of the operation of the act. It is p'ossible, however, that a producer may at any time desire to withdraw from the operation of the act and participation in bounty, and to be free from compliance with the undertakings he had given as to allowing inspection of the mine, &c. It is reasonable that, this contingency should be provided for, and the suggested amendment of the form of application is for this purpose.",18,Second Reading

69,That Mr Scullin And Mr Mcneill Do Pre,"Bill brought up by Mr Souxmr; and read a first time. ter) ['4.6] I move That the bill be now read a second time. The bill provides for these new rates of income tax to be applied in assessments for the present financial year, and will give effect to the Government's proposals1. to increase tlie normal rates (i.e. the rates exclusive of the special tax on property incomes) of tax payable by companies and individuals by 5 per cent, all round; and 2. to increase the special tax on taxable inexpressed the opinion that the desired comes from property from 7 i per cent, to 10 per cent, of the amount of that income. As already announced in the budget speech, the estimated yield of additional tax from the increase of 5 per cent, is £380,000, and that from the increase of the special tax on property incomes is £830,000. necessary to make up the estimated total additional revenue of £1,500,000 is expected to be obtained from the reduction of the general exemption of personal exertion incomes from £300, diminishing by £1 for every £3 of the excess over £300 and vanishing at £1,200, to £250, diminishing by £1 for every £2 of the excess over £250, and vanishing at £750. The reduction in the general exemption of personal exertion incomes will be provided for in the Income Tax Assessment Bill which is to be introduced. A special feature of the Income Tax Bill will be the consolidation of the original schedule rates of 1915 and all the existing super-taxes and additional and further taxes, except the special tax on property incomes, into one rate expressed in a simple formula for personal exertion and property incomes, respectively, and ascertainable in respect of any given amount of taxable income by a simple arithmetical calculation. The confusion resulting from the existing super-taxes and additional and further taxes, and the complexities of the curves of the second and existing formulae, has been a source of continual annoyance and trouble to the vast majority of taxpayers, and has, in its practical result, made them completely dependent upon the Taxation Department's ready reckoners for the ascertainment of the extent of their liability for tax. The Government, in its desire to eliminate, where practicable, any complexities in a system of taxation which is inevitably complex in its very nature, instituted inquiries into the possibility of obtaining a more simple rate without materially altering the result obtained under the existing system in the amount of tax assessable in any particular case. For that purpose, the Government obtained the expert advice of Professor Giblin who, on looking into the matter, result could be obtained. The new consolidated rates are fully explained in Professor Giblin's notes, which have been circulated among honourable members. It should be noted that the consolidated rates have been designed to incorporate all existing rates and super-taxes, &c, plus the proposed increase of 5 per cent. The balance of £290,000 They do not, however, incorporate the proposed special tax of 10 per cent, on property incomes. The rate of tax on income from personal exertion is contained in the first schedule; and that on income from property is contained in the second schedule. To calculate in any particular case the amount to be added for the special tax on property incomes, it is merely necessary to add to the tax calculated under the second schedule 10 per cent, of the amount of the taxable income from property. Honourable members will find attached to the circulated notes of Professor Giblin, two statements-Tabl e "" A "" and Table"" B ""-whic h give a comparison, at stated amounts of taxable income, between the rate which would apply and the tax which would be paid if the old method of calculation were applied to the taxes proposed for the present financial year, and the rates which will apply and the tax which will be paid under the new method. The tables also compare, at stated amounts of taxable income, the taxes which will be paid, for the present third degrees caused by the financial year, 1931-32, with the taxes which were payable for the last financial year, 1930-31. The tax under the new method, as shown in the tables, has not been worked out to the last decimal point,",23,Division J Severally Owned Partnership

Debate resumed from the 29th May (vide page 2427), on motion by Mr bill was introduced with a bona fide desire Tliat the bill be now read a second time. Once again this House is invited to con-, sider the unfortunate subject of federal industrial conciliation and arbitration. This is the fifteenth bill on this subject that has been introduced in this Parliament since 1904. Many of these bills have been introduced with high hopes and confident anticipations of benefits to follow for the community as a whole, and again and again those hopes and anticipations have been disappointed until many people are wondering whether the power of this Parliament, as expressed in the Constitution, to legislate in respect of arbitration and conciliation has not, in practice, had a result exactly opposite to that was expected by those who were responsible for the early legislation on this subject. The last amending act was passed as recently as August last, and now we have a further amendment before us. The legislation as finally passed by both Houses last year was in terms which represented a compromise between conflicting views. A conference was held between representatives of this House and the last legislation, provided that Taxable Income. Present Tax Proposed Tax (including Super-tax).

This bill deals with what was represented by the Commonwealth to be one of the principal features of its industrial policythe extension of opportunity for conciliation as distinct from arbitration. The Government stated that the last amending on its part to provide a further means of conciliation as distinct from arbitration. In fact, as was pointed out at the time, there was already iu the act ample provision for conciliation. Every opportunity that could be or had ever been suggested for applying what might be called the conciliation jurisdiction of the court was available under then existing legislation. The registrar, the judges, the conciliation commissioners and committees were all available to perform the function of conciliation. When the last legislation was passing through Parliament, it was suspected by some honourable members on this side of the House that the real object of .the. Government was not to extend the, ^conciliation powers of the court, but to provide a means of preventing thecourt from functioning whenever the Government desired. The suggestion, however, was repudiated by the Government, and the legislation was passed, so far as this part of it was concerned, in a form that was considered satisfactory by the Government. Section 33 of the act, as amended by",24,Second Beading
71,Mr Latham (Kooyong) [4.16],,28,Brennan
72,"Motion By Mr Lyons) Another Place, And, As A Result, Legislation","whenever a conciliation committee was appointed by the Government of the day, the Arbitration Court should cease to function in relation to that matter during the period in respect of which the conciliation committee was appointed. Therefore, it was possible under the act as passed last year for the Government to prevent the Arbitration Court from functioning in relation to some of its most important duties. The bill promise, and it passed this House. As soon as it was through there arose an agitation among certain of the trade unions for the appointment of conciliation committees. The Government was urged to appoint such committees in order to prevent the Arbitration Court from dealing with applications for the reduction of wages. Of course, one can readily understand any man, or any body of men, adopting that attitude. to-day we have to recognize that we are passing through a period of economic adjustment, and I think one might not unfairly say that every section of the community is interested in one way or another, and every section is, to some extent at least, resisting the re-adjustment insofar as it affects their private interests. That is quite natural. We, however, in this Parliament represent all the people, and we ought to consider legislation, not from the point of view of this section or of that, but of the community as a whole. We should not accept legislation which is designed to enable one party to industry, whether employers or employees, to hold up the operations of the Arbitration Court whenever it suits them. That, unfortunately, was the effect, and the intended effect, of the last arbitration legislation. After the last amending bill was passed through Parliament, it was not disguised that the hope and expectation of the unions was that the Government of the day, being amenable to their influence, would appoint conciliation committees so as to prevent the Arbitration Court from bringing about a re-adjustment of wages under federal awards. must admit that the Government made a vernment to maim the Arbitration Court, fairly effective resistance to the demand and prevent it from functioning whenever for the appointment of commissioners. Mr Latham. of conciliation committees, of which no fewer than seventeen were appointed. There was no real pretence that any dispute existed between employers and employees in the industries affected, except this matter of economic re-adjustment. Nevertheless, the conciliation committees were appointed, and it cannot be seriously denied, I think, that the object of their appointment was to prevent the was accepted as a comArbitration Court from functioning. When applications were made by the railway commissioners of various Statesincluding States in which Labour governments were finding it impossible to balance their budgets, because of railways rendered unprofitable largely by arbitration awards-the industrial unions raised the point that, owing to the appointment of conciliation committees, the Arbitration Court was unable to function. The matter went to the High Court, and the point In Australia at issue was whether the appointment of so-called conciliation committees prevented the Arbitration Court from functioning in, respect to applications for a reduction of the basic wage. The High Court found, in the railways case, that the provision relating to conciliation committees was invalid for the reason that the act purported to confer on them arbitral powers, but did not effectively provide for arbitration, for the hearing of parties and for such procedure as would bind all parties to a dispute. It was held, therefore, that the provision in section 34 being invalid, the other provision in section 33 preventing the Arbitration Court from dealing with matters during the period of office of conciliation committees, was itself ineffective. Therefore, the bar to the action of the Arbitration Court was removed, and the court had jurisdiction to hear applications in respect of the basic wage. The result is that, although the conciliation committees appointed under the existing act are able to perform all their functions of conciliation, the Arbitration Court cannot be prevented from hearing applications. The bill now before us is intended to remedy that result of the act, and the Government is of opinion that, for",28,Brennan

If this bill is passed,, it will be possible for Governor General shall appoint the comthe Government to remove any matter from the Arbitration Court-wit h some negligible exceptions to which I shall refer later-wheneve r it suits the Government, or those behind the Government, to follow that course.. Until section 34 was inserted in the act last year, there was no. power in any government to affect the proceedings of the Arbitration Couri. The conciliation committees, provided for under the legislation passed in 1928, were appointed by the Chief Judge, not by the Government, and the whole of the proceeding was under the control of the court, subject to the conciliation committees discharging their functions of conciliation in their own way. There was no possibility of interference with the eourt by the Government. The last amending act provided for this interference, in the sense of preventing the court, at the will of the Government, from discharging its functions in cases in which it was possible to appoint conciliation committees, which means in practically all cases. tion committees to deal with a matter at the wish of one of the parties? is right; but, in fact, conciliation committees can be appointed without any application by either party. Moreover, whenever either party wanted to prevent the court from acting, it would apply for the appoiritment of a conciliation committee, and its application would be granted if the Government so desired. In any event, it depended on the will of the Government. The undesirable feature of the arrangement is that powers of arbitration are conferred ou these conciliation committees, and it is the Government which determines the industry in relation to which they are appointed, the period they are appointed for, and their personnel.

109,Mr Latham,"Claus e 7 providesknow exactly where we stand. If the intention of the clause is merely to remove a certain amount of inconvenience, I suggest that that could be done by an issue of the Government Gazette. We must face the fact that the sooner there is an economic re-adjustment in this country the better it will be for everybody. The Government has informed us that the national income has fallen from £650,000,000 three years ago to approximately £450,000,000, a reduction of 30 per cent. In a speech which the Treasurer broadcast a few nights ago he said that any one who thought that old wage rates could continue in present circumstances, was living in a world of illusion. It is unpleasant to have one's income reduced, but no service, will be done to the workers of this country by allowing them to think that wages can be maintained at the old rates. Some honourable members opposite appear to r.hink that honourable members on this side of the chamber like reducing wages. That is pure nonsense. But from considerations of common sense, as well as of humanity and patriotism, it is wise thai the people should be told clearly that a [though it is desirable to maintain wages a i the highest possible point, they cannot be maintained at the old rates. To pass legislation to provide that the wages of every person in the community should be £500 per annum would be -just as foolish, and would be fraught with at l^ast as much danger to the community, as to pass legislation to provide that no wages should exceed a rate of £500 per annum. In our wage-fixing legislation we must have regard for economic realities. Wages come from the proceeds of industry, and from nowhere else. Government is foolish if it hopes that by the enactment of this provision it will render inoperative the 10 per cent, reduction which the Arbitration Court has ordered in the basic wage. clause is passed there may be a disastrous and devastating increase in unemployment. We are considering this bill at a time when the Government has, at the eleventh hour, recognized that unless real weight Labour is given to economic considerations that proposal. Australia will be ruined. Yet this provision will prevent the Arbitration Court, and other federal industrial section 38 D as it now stands, the Itfr. Latham. authorities, from having regard to economic considerations. Section 38 D of the principal act provides. (1.) If it appears to the court on the application of any organization or person interested or of the Registrar(a) that an organization entitled to the benefit of an order or award has conimitted any other breach or nonobservance of the act or of an order or award; (6) that any number of members of an organization, sufficiently large . to form a substantial part of the organization, refuses to accept employment either at all or in accordance with existing orders or awards; or (c) that for any other reason an order «r award ought to be suspended or cancelled in whole or in part, the court may, by order, subject to such conditions as it thinks f it , suspend or cancel for such period as it thinks fit, all or any of the terms of any order or award in force so far as the order or award applies to, or is in favour of, the organization or its members. The effect of clause 6 is to strike out from paragraph c the words "" from reason "", and so prevent the Arbitration Coun from having regard to the circumstances of an industry or the economic condition of the community. Honourable members who pay close attention to industrial matters will remember that the employees' representatives who appeared in the recent basic wage case argued thai the court should not pay any regard whatever to the economic condition of the community. That, of course, would amount to economic and social lunacy. any honourable member of this party, OJ of this Government, has adopted thai attitude.

If , for example, it is shown that an industry cannot continue to pay the wages provided in any award or order the court may suspend or cancel any such award or order. By the removal of the word "" reason"" the court would be deprived of the power to take into consideration the economic condition of the industry, or of the community as a whole. It is also proposed to add two paragraphs to the section, namely(d) that all the parties bound by the order or award have consented to its suspension, cancellation or setting aside in whole or iu part; or (e) that it is desirable, by the reason of the making of a further order or award binding on all or any of those parties, that the order or award should be cancelled. In effect, paragraph d provides that the court may act by consent, which it can do at present; and paragraph e provides that it may cancel an award or order only in the event of a new order or award being made. Honourable members may think that that provision adequately meets the situation. ber for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin) knows better than his interjection suggests. able for the court to vary an order or award than for it to wipe it out altogether. make a new award in the case of a new dispute. We are working under one of the most remarkable systems of industrial legislation in the world. Many years ago it was enacted in section 24 of the Arbitration Act that in the event of an industrial dispute occurring and the parties being unable to reach an agreement, the court or a conciliation committee could, by an order, "" determine the dispute"". That was all right as far as it went; but, unfortunately, it was subsequently held by the High Court that during the currency of the original term of an award there could be no dispute upon any matter which was at issue prior to the making of the award. Consequently, men might be at one another's throats, and there might be widespread lockouts and strikes, but there could be no dispute if the matter at issue between the parties was one which the Arbitration Court had dealt with in the making of the award in question. That, of course, is a consequence of the queer industrial power of this Parliament. All the matters dealt with in an award, made in pursuance of the provisions of section 34 of the act, were presumed to have been settled in a friendly manner; yet the country might actually be torn asunder because some of these matters had not actually been settled. If honourable members desire further light on this subject. I refer them to the gas-workers' case. ber himself was responsible for the setting up of conciliation committees. conciliation committees they are all right, but as arbitration authorities they are seriously defective. that it would take me a long time to state them. But I repeat that the object is to prevent the Arbitration Court, or the so-calledi cotociliation committees, from taking into account the general economic condition of the community-in this instance, in relation to the suspension or cancellation of awards. We hear much talk about the maintenance of standards. I repeat, that I believe in the highest economic standards that we can maintain, but honourable members are aware of what is happening all over the Commonwealth. Even where awards apply they are being evaded wholesale, and no action is being taken by the organizations that are aware of these unfortunate facts. Work cannot possibly be given in the terms of some awards, and, if we have any common sense or reason, we shall realize that there must be a reconsideration of wages in many industries, and of labour conditions in nearly all, and the sooner the better for the unemployed. Too often employers and employees are ready to agree in the court to any new condition if the burdeD can be passed on to the community. It might be worthwhile to allow counsel for the unemployed to appear in every case. It is useless to pass legislation to",33,Brennan

"" B y consent"" means nothing, and I have pointed out that a new award cannot be made, during the currency of an existing award, in relation to any matter within the ambit of the original award. Eor mauy years we have been livingin a very uureal world in regard to industrial affairs. We have been able to maintain our outlook only because of the extraordinary prosperity we have enjoyed owing to the high prices of wool and wheat, and to the expenditure of a large amount of borrowed money. It will, be to the advantage of every worthy element in the community to bring about, as quickly as possible, that economic re-adjustment which the reduction of the national income makes inevitable, and not to set up any artificial obstacles such as this bill proposes to create. In all the circumstances I cannot support the measure. The speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) was much ado about nothing. Apparently, when agreeing to the existing provisions relating to the conciliation committees, the honourable gentleman anticipated that the High Court would declare them invalid. He supported the appointment of committees then, and he opposes the system now. I opposed those provisions then, and I oppose them now, because the defects in them will not be improved one iota by the bill. conciliation committees is futile. The act does not do what it was intended to do, and the bill does not repeal the appeal section, in respect of which the Government made such a cowardly surrender to the Senate. Nobody can question that the Labour party had a mandate from the people to go right ahead with its industrial policy, but the Government surrendered at the first onslaught by the Senate. The provisions in the act relating to conciliation committees is mere camouflage and humbug. They purported to give to the committees arbitral powers, so that they could rectify or prevent unfair decisions by other bodies. The Senate provided for a right of appeal from the decisions of the committee to the Arbitration Court, and thereby rendered nugatory the Government's policy. Attorney-General wanted those provisions to be rendered nugatory, because the present bill does not repeal them. Was all the talk in which we indulged when we were in opposition and on the hustings, simply eyewash ? Were we simply tickling the ears of the electors with the object of getting into power and staying there at any sacrifice of them and our. principles? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that the Arbitration Coiu-t should take into consideration the probable economic effect of a proposed award. To that the Attorney-General said, "" Hear, hear!"" When we were in opposition we fought with all our might against that provision, and the Attorney General was one of tlie strongest opponents of it. that special duty should not be enjoined on a judge; his discretion should not be hampered.

The directors of those firms are now living in palatial suburban dwellings, which have been built put of the sweat, tears, misery and slavery of their employees. The honourable member 1 for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley) can supply illuminating information on that subject, because at one time, when a member of the Arbitration Court, he was instrumental in proving that the representatives of these big establishments had perjured themselves in court. In my electorate, before I was its member, the representatives of the coal-owners had their perjured experts at Wollongong Swearing that there was no gas in the Mount Kembla mine. While their evidence was being given an explosion took place, while the miners were at work, actually caused by the gas in that mine. These facts are on record, and cannot be gainsaid by honourable members opposite. The Arbitration Court was established to get rid of conditions such as those, and for that reason the Labour movement, the industrial organizations, and the workers accepted the principle of arbitration. When Mr Justice Higgins, in the Harvester case, laid down the famous principle that industry, in order to live, must pay a progressive living wage, the Labour movement, on the industrial and political sides, accepted the principle of arbitration, knowing that when they were able to show, by means of data supplied to the court, exactly what the cost of living was, the court could not fix the basic wage at anything less thau that. On that understanding only did the Labour movement accept arbitration, and on that basis, the super-structure of arbitration awards was to be built up. There was to be an extra margin for skill, technical knowledge, danger of the occupation, &c. Now, according to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Arbitration Court, when fixing the basic wage, is to consider, not the cost of living, but what industry can afford to pay. If that policy be followed to its logical conThen, an employee in those clusion, the Arbitration Court can be used to re-institute all the evils of the sweating system which it was created to destroy. This bill w ill . not give to the Under those workers anything for which they are asking. It will not prevent the Arbitration Court from reducing wages by 10 per cent, or 20 per cent, if it likes. I desire to place on record my opinion that the arbitration system as now administered is utterly futile. It is lop-sided, and results in the victimization of the workers. When an application is being heard before the court, the business secrets of the employers must be scrupulously respected, even though the country itself is crumbling to decay. In this very Arbitration Act there is a provision that if an industrial representative discloses any business secrets which he may hear in court he may be fined £500. In my opinion, the fact that the employers are so jealous of these business secrets is the very reason why they should be dragged out into the light of day. It is time this-.humbug *was ended. The court does not hesitate to make the most searching inquiry into the lives of citizens if they happen to be workers. They are made to disclose how much beer they drink, how much tobacco they smoke, how much rent they pay, and what clothes they wear. Even the women are dragged into court, and made to give evidence as to the cost of their most intimate articles of clothing. formation. these inquisitorial methods can be applied to the wives and daughters of workers, they should be applied also to the wives and daughters of the employers. If the worker is made to disclose his income and all the details of his expenditure, then the employer should be made to disclose his profits, and other relevant details of his business. So long as arbitration is being employed, as it now is, to drive the workers back to the old sweating conditions, it is only a delusion and a snare, and the sooner it is thrown overboard tbe better. posed the Government's amending bill last year, and, in view of subsequent events, I have much pleasure in opposing",37,Brennan

I understood him to say that the arbitration system was of no use to the workers, and of no use to him. There are many other people also who believe that the system is of no use to the country at this time, and that its suspension is desirable. came into power in 1929 it had before it one important task-the amendment of the Arbitration Act. Eor twenty years or more arbitration courts had been consistently raising wages, and the workers as a whole were eminently satisfied with the system. The Labour party came into power with a mandate, as it was called, to improve the arbitration law so that the process of pushing wages ever upwards might be continued. mandate, but did not have the machinery. that already the process of raising wages had gone too far. The arbitration courts, which in the past had yielded to the pressure of the unions, had called a halt, and were inclined to bring about some reductions. The Government thereupon changed its tactics, and by means of the amending bill introduced last year, so altered the arbitration system as to make it possible, it believed, to peg wages at their existing level. The scheme was astute in its conception, and simple in design. It set out to substitute for the Arbitration Court a series of conciliation committees, so-called, though their powers went far beyond conciliation. It was intended to paralyse the Arbitration Court by giving power to either party to a dispute to make application for the appointment of a conciliation committee. During the operation of this committee, the Arbitration Court was to be powerless to vary the existing award. That was a very good scheme from the Government's point of view if it had worked, but it proved to be ineffective. The High Court has held that the whole provision is invalid. Now the Attorney-General comes before Parliament and asks us to remedy the mistakes he made in drafting the last bill, and, in addition, to grant further powers to the conciliation committees. For my part, I refuse, not only to help in remedying the mistakes, but to grant any further powers. Indeed, if 1 had the opportunity, I would go further, and take action to suspend the operation of the Arbitration Court for at least three years, or until the country had made sufficient progress towards"" recovery. I have not the slightest doubt that the When the Labour party arbitration courts have been a most important factor in hampering industry in Australia. When the amending bill was brought down last year, there was' much talk about the industrial disputes which these conciliation committees were to settle. We see now that, although the committees have been utterly inoperative, there has been an almost entire cessation of strikes. The reason, of course, is the general shortage of money. It is the ' absence of prosperity that is responsible for the absence of strikes, and I have no doubt that, if we ever get back to the old prosperous' conditions again, strikes will be just as numerous as ever, whether we have an arbitration court or conciliation committees. I believe that the arbitration courts, coupled with the operation of the tariff, have been, to a large extent, responsible for the lamentable position in which Australia finds itself to-day. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) advanced one of the soundest reasons for the abolition of the arbitration system. He, and other honourable members opposite, have shown that the effect of the arbitration system is to produce a steady upward movement in the cost of living, and that wages are for ever chasing this increase. Therefore, even though the courts grant increased wages, the workers do not derive any real benefit. There was a time when things were flush with us-whe n we were living beyond our means, on borrowed moneywhen we could afford to keep pushing wages steadily upwards; but that time has gone, and I believe that the majority of honourable members opposite recognize that. For that reason, it would be better, I think, if the Government refrained from introducing controversial measures",38,Brennan

Parliament has already devoted too much of its time to the consideration of the arbitration legislation. ceed any quicker with the finance bills. the Government is serious in bringing in this bill; it is merely making a gesture to its supporters. I cannot believe that it has any reasonable expectation of seeing the bill passed, and I have a good deal of satisfaction in opposing it. glad that there are some honourable members' on the opposite benches who candidly, and even brutally, declare that their object is the destruction of the arbitration system. I do not know whether the honourable member for Perth( Mr who pay the income tax and sales tax, Nairn), and the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen), have expressed the views of their own party. The wages of 771,000 men registered under federal arbitration awards have been wrongfully cut by the judges of the Arbitration Court. That tribunal, in the Railways Union case, said that it was necessary, in the interests of employment in Australia, to decrease the cost of production by reducing wages. Members of the Opposition declare that that was a sound proEederated Unions of Australia, including nouncement, but I suggest that there has been a marked increase in unemployment, since that cut was made.

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that he would abolish arbitration, except for one section of industry. in practising his profession, he obtained a lot of money by way of legal fees from trade unions, I admit that, as an industrial lawyer, he was the best man available, but he was not the right person to regulate industrial conditions with which he was unfamiliar. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also had a tilt at the Transport Workers Act, another abomination, which has caused more trouble than any other measure passed by this Parliament. It put 11,000 men out of work for three years, and included among them were 8,000 returned soldiers. has no foundation for that statement. has shown his interest of late in those but he has done nothing for the benefit of the toilers. Every honourable member knows that the abolition of arbitration awards, or wage reductions, would bring about a reduction of .the cost of production, but what honourable members opposite really want is that the employers should not be policed by any arbitration laws. The amendment sought under this bill is desired on behalf of the whole of the the Australian Workers Union. I have no delusions about arbitration. From practical experience of it, I claim that it still has some advantages, though not many. Although it admittedly ensures a minimum wage and a maximum number of hours, when a depression occurs, or when there has been some muddling of industry, the employers can induce the court to cancel or vary an award. [Quorum formed.] The employers of Australia, and the Opposition in this chamber, contend that the cost of production must be reduced, and I think that they would admit that all they have in mind is the reduction of wages.

The present Government has decided that the court should be freed from legal entanglements, and, to that end, conciliation committees, which were provided for under the last amending bill, are to be authorized in an improved form under the present measure.

I shall support this bill because I believe that the trade unions favour it, and that it provides for the handling of industrial problems in a practical way by practical men. It appears to me that-the views of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr wage reductions. If a conservative inLatham) have changed since the previous Arbitration Bill was before us.. On the former occasion he said that there was nothing wrong with the legality of conciliation committees; but he has now changed his opinion. legality of the committees. honourable member has reversed -his opinion on many aspects of this subject. We should do our best to protect the interests of the workers. It was stated in this House last month that in consequence of variations and cancellations of arbitration awards, the workers of Australia had already lost £24,000,000. I believe that they have lost six times that amount in consequence of the prevailing unemployment. The workers rightly expect this Government to do something to protect their interests, and they are giving the Government every opportunity in this regard. It was indicated in an official statement in the House recently that in the last twelve months there had not been a strike or a hold-up in a single-Australian industry. I believe that if conciliation committees are constituted for all our major industries industrial peace will continue, for legal complications, which do a great deal to foment industrial strife, are not likely to arise. When I need meat I go to a butcher; when I need a haircut I go to a hairdresser. I go to the practical man every time. So, when I want to ensure the smooth working of our industrial machinery, I go to those who should control it, namely, the employers and the employees. Our union lenders have, in most cases, been engaged in this highly specialized work for many years, and are well acquainted with the practical problems of industry. There is no reason why legal gentlemen should interfere in this matter. I do not suggest that it is the ordinary thing for absurd awards to Those organizations expect be made; but I assert, without hesitation, that the machinery of courts is clumsy and cumbersome. If disputes could be referred without delay to thoroughly competent representatives of employers and employees, they could, in most cases, be promptly settled. We ought to do everything that we possibly can do to stop the landslide in stitution like the Bank of England believes that a policy of drastic wage reduction would be calamitous to Australia, surely Labour members of this Parliament are entitled to express the same opinion. I regret that although wages I did not discuss the have already been reduced there is no sign of interest on bank overdrafts and advances being reduced, although we have been told that this is a vital part of the rehabilitation plan. Everything was to be reduced, but, as usual, wages have been reduced first. The trade unionists of Australia have every right to expect this Government to take all possible steps to see that wages are not reduced except by constitutional means. Already the arbitration awards governing 36 different groups of workers in the Victorian Railway Department have been cancelled. This is a most serious thing for the workers, who were not given any opportunity to show how overhead and other expenses in the operation of the railways could have been reduced. There was no need for the ruthless sweeping aside of all our wage standards by persons who do not know the "" ABO "" of railway management. that the court has not been exercising arbitration powers, but has been imposing compulsory sacrifice. for the Commonwealth Attorney-General to make. 21,000 persons have been dismissed from the Railway Department of Victoria, although we were told that by reducing wages it would be possible to provide more employment. That argument is just as irrational, to my mind, as the argument",41,Brennan

177,Mr Brennan,It is a fact.,42,Brennan
178,Mr Keane,"It is also a fact thatthat by increasing the hours of work it would bo possible to increase employment. The remedy in each case simply aggravates the trouble. How on earth is it possible to provide more work by making the weekly working hours 48 instead of 44? If that can be done, black is not black. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. tion committees in lieu of legal arbitrators, is essential, because legal men, having no knowledge of industry, cannot be expected to be able to settle disputes between employers and employees. have shown that the Opposition complaint that arbitration has been a burden to industry is not justified. The general result of arbitration has been an inadequate basic wage with some slight margins. Awards have not provided for sickness, injury, or holiday pay. To-day we read that the private banks, which have made a profit of £13,000,000 in nine years, have joined in the wage slash. A court of legal judges has granted their application despite the fact that they have not reduced interest on advances and overdrafts as this House was led to believe they would. A job is done well only when it is handled by men who understand it. An inquiry into the sugar industry should be conducted by sugar experts. Similarly, industrial disputes should be settled by experts-by the representatives of employers and. employees. The object of this bill is to validate secproper functioning of conciliation comtions 33 and 34 which this Parliament believed to be sound when it enacted them, but which the High Court ruled otherwise. The necessity for arbitration policing is greater now than at any time during the last eight or ten years, because men are being driven by economic necessity to work for any rates the employers choose to offer. That is a condition of affairs to which those who are opposed to this bill would like Australia to revert. necessary. The bill is not loaded; They 'consider that the suspension of arbitration awards is a corollary of the financial rehabilitation plan. I have no great faith in the arbitration law, but at' least it provides for reasonable rate3 of 'pay and working hours. If the restraint which it 'exercises were removed many employers would revert to the conditions so graphically described by the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) this afternoon. I too recollect those dark days that preceded the judicial regulation of industry. The employers are still making large profits. The legal gentlemen on the arbitration bench, before all of whom I have appeared, introduced, in connection with the recent basic wage case, three considerations entirely new to the procedure of the court. I am not prepared to allow the court to exercise its powers without restraint. The conciliation committees will do a great deal of good; they will eliminate legal jargon and prevent I lawyers from meddling in things they do not understand, stringing out/Cases in order to collect big fees, and too often making a shocking mess of the business they have in hand. Lawyers are necessary for the drawing up of wills, but that is about the only purpose for which I would employ them. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) and his followers are always stressing the need to reduce the cost of production. This bill is a measure to help the people who supported the Labour party at the polls. Nationalists do not vote for me; I Avas elected by Labour votes, and I intend to state the views of the Labour movement. Although the Arbitration Act has not achieved the success that we hoped of it, it is the only policeman that can to-day protect the workers. Wage slashing is in progress, and the mittees will give to those men in jobs at least the satisfaction of knowing that if a reduction does take place it will be only after an exhaustive hearing by a tribunal on which they, as well as the employers, are represented. I find no fault with the act. When the amending bill was agreed to some months ago, members of the Opposition were agreed that conciliation committees were it represents the desires of many thousands of registered trade unionists. Moreover, it is in accord with the oft expressed desires of the employers. They have urged that employers and employees should meet at the conference table and discuss their grievances without the doubtful aid of shorthand writers and lawyers.

The measure should have the support of every member of the Opposition, especially having regard to the audacious attitude of the Senate towards the previous arbitration bill introduced by this Government. 1 am just awakening to the fact that, instead of accepting the Senate's dictation in this matter, we should have referred the issue to a general election. The senators were guilty of political bushranging. A few old gentlemen who had not been before the people for three years had the audacity to reject the legislation of this House, which represented the recent choice of the electors. able member is not in order in reflecting on members of the other branch of the legislature.

The honourable member possesses oue of the best industrial legal minds in the Commonwealth, and, if his views were right last year, he must, to bo consistent, support the bill. The measure will have my support for the paramount reason that it is wanted by the trade union movement. It is equitable, and will make for amicable relations between employers and employees. the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr share of. what he produces. But nobody Keane) is so much in favour of conciliation committees as he professes to be, why does he want to retain the Arbitration Court with all its panoply and expense? Why not agree at once to the abolition of the court and allow industrial conditions to be settled by conciliation committees representative of employers and employees? The natural deduction to be drawn from his attitude is that he desires to get ""rid of the Arbitration Court; so do I . After a long observation of its operations, I am convinced that nothing has doue more injury to Australia,, created more antagonism between the partiesto industry, and rendered worse service to the community. When the arbitration system was first introduced, people were delighted with the knowledge that in future industrial strife and ill-feeling would be obviated by recourse to a tribunal presided over by a judge, which would decide between the parties. For a time employers and employees alike went confidently before the courts, loyally accepted their decisions, and were well satisfied; but, in the course of time, it became apparent that the party which swore hardest scored most. It was obvious also that a legal president, no matter how learned in the law, might know very little about industrial conditions. Then the tug-o'-war started. Both employers and employees formed organizations, and prepared for the next appeal to the court. Antagonism between the parties increased, and honourable members will recollect that the Scottish commissioners who visited Australia reported that in no country in the world had they seen evidence of such bitterness between employers and I bow to your ruling, employees as existed in Australia. member and his colleagues have done their best to promote class antagonism. One can sec evidence of that every day in the trade union movement. To-day the honourable member declared that the Arbitration Court should take no cognizance of economic conditions. If the value of products decreases, how can the employees get the same share of the proceeds of industry as when prices were high? The worker should get a fair connected with the trade union movement would admit that men should be paid according to the value of their work. All men mu."" be brought to the same low level; no man must rise above his fellows! That policy cannot possibly be good for a country; indeed, it is resulting disastrously in Australia. Industry is burdened by the high costs of appeals to the Arbitration Court. I say nothing against the State arbitration courts; the States must conduct their affairs as they see fit, but it is ridiculous to maintain a federal system of arbitration by which a judge sitting in Melbourne or Sydney may fix the conditions of industry from Darwin to Hobart, and from Melbourne to Broome. visit Western Australia.",43,Brennan

185,Mr Tully,"The arbitration judgesthe Arbitration Court, with all its paraphernalia, should travel all over Australia ? Greater liberty should be allowed in connection with industry. We cannot ignore the effects of the federal arbitration system, particularly as revealed in connection with the coal-mining industry. Many years ago the coal-miners had recourse to the Arbitration Court of New South Wales. Later the Federal Arbitration Court was established; so that the coal-miners were able to approach the State Court first and the Commonwealth Court afterwards. That position did not bring peace in industry. When the right honourable .member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) was Prime Minister, he introduced the Industrial Peace Act, and under its provisions a special board was established to deal with the coal-mining industry. The result was that the employers and the employees put their heads together and the price of coal was increased from l is a . ton in 1925. There was no peace in industry. A little while ago the manager of a nickel mine in New Caledonia, in an interview, pointed out that at one time, his company used to purchase coal from Australia, but because of the increase in price, and the difficulty of getting supplies owing to strikes, it obtained its coal, and other requirements, from Europe, with the result that Australia lost a trade valued at £500,000 a year. There would have not been such a huge expenditure in connection with the electricity scheme at Yallourn, Victoria, had it not been for the continual increase in the price of coal. At one time a Premier of South Australia stated that he could save over £100,000 by importing coal from Great Britain for use on the State railways. We have had shipping troubles in the past, but to-day there is little trouble, because of the depression. When times were prosperous shipping strikes were numerous. In 1914 we had a shipping service that we were proud of, but to-day most of our ships are laid up because of high freights and consequent lack of trade. We hear of complaints about the non use of Australian timbers, but it costs three times as much to send timber from Launceston to Adelaide as from Norway to Adelaide. The arbitration system has conferred no benefits upon the workers. Increase of wages has brought in its train an increase in the cost of living. Enormous sums have been wrung from the workers by their various union organizations, and I venture to say that they have gained nothing whatever from the arbitration system. This amending bill provides for the establishment of conciliation committees, but that term is misleading because these committees are to be given full power to make an award which will have the force of law. In Canadai f there is, or is likely to be, a dispute in industry, the Minister of Labour may appoint three persons as a committee. The duty of that committee is to bring the parties together in an effort to effect some agreement, and any agreement which is arrived at and signed is binding only on the parties concerned. member be satisfied if this Government -a ton in 1913 to 25s. 6d. appointed three persons as a conciliation committee ? mittee has no power to make an award, so that the position there is totally different from what it is here. It is deliberately misleading to describe the committee to be established under this legislation as a conciliation committee. For the last fifteen or sixteen years I have watched the working of the arbitration system in Australia, and I consider that it has done more than anything else to injure our industries; it is an expensive piece of legal machinery which has brought about nothing but animosity between employer and employee, and the sooner we get rid of the Arbitration Act the better it will be for Australia as a whole. When speaking on this subject the other night I compared the rate of wages paid on the Australian railways with that paid on the railways of the United States of America. I pointed out that 1,600,000 railway employees in the United States of America were paid an average wage of just over 35s. a day. There, is no arbitration there; it is all a question of service. Oiir arbitration system has destroyed any good feeling that previously existed between the employer and the employee, because although the Arbitration Court may increase wages",44,Brennan

Consequently, no good feeling exists between them. While the arbitration system remains we shall never build up the industries of this country. could understand the opposition to this amending bill were it notf for the fact that in substance it seeks to make legal, provisions which this Parliament incorporated in the Arbitration Act less than a year ago. Although in the early stages of the debate last year the Opposition members opposed the form which these conciliation committees were to take, and had serious doubts as to the wisdom of giving them certain powers, the measure finally left this Parliament, not only with the approval of honourable members opposite, but also with an eloquent benediction pronounced upon it by the then Leader of the Opposition. honourable member led us to believe that since last November he had come to the conclusion that these conciliation committees were unnecessary, and that, in effect, their purpose was not only to intersentatives of both sides will necessarily fere with the proper functioning of the court, but also to make it possible for the decisions of the court to be evaded. There is a history to this bill. It is most extracertainly no responsible Minister, would ordinary that almost every amendment to the Arbitration Act has been made necessary by interpretations placed upon the powers of this Parliament by the High Court. Werei t not for the decisions of the High Court made in connection with the railway case, in which the competency of this Parliament to provide for the establishment of conciliation committees was questioned, there would have been no occasion for this amending bill. argue the merits of arbitration as against non-arbitration. The bill does not seek to destroy the principle of arbitration. It does not impair the capacity of the court to deal with the basic wage or standard hours. Those powers are preserved for the court in the terms of the principal act, and this amending bill in no way infringes upon the important work which the full Arbitration Court is at present discharging. Anybody who imagines that these conciliation committees can be used as a sort of a buffer to protect the workers against further slashes in the basic wage, entirely misapprehends the purpose of the bill. This measure merely attempts-and I am not certain whether it will be successfula realization of what must now be accepted as tbe will of this Parliament instead of the will of the Arbitration Court. It is desired to appoint conciliation committees' to deal only with matters in dispute other than the basic wage and standard hours. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) has suggested that much of the irritation and conflict in connection with the relations between employers and employees has been caused by the Arbitration Court, and to the extent that that is true, this amending bill provides a means whereby vexatious litigation can at least be minimized. The parties will be brought together. They will be directly representative of the employers and employees This afternoon that and, despite the provision of the bill to which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred this afternoon, under which the Governor General has the power to appoint, the fact remains that the reprehave to participate in the work of the committee, if it is to function reasonably and satisfactorily. No government, and attempt to impose upon the employers in a particular industry, a group of representatives who were entirely alien to their interests, and with no connection whatever with the industry concerned. It is a travesty upon common sense to assume that any such representation would be tolerated. Both sides to industry will, be brought together, but not in an open court, with legal disputants present; they will assemble in an ordinary room, as I do not propose to men directly conversant with the industry in which they are engaged. There will 'be no need for witnesses to be summoned by subpoena, or for cross-examination by learned or unlearned counsel. All that will be required will be that the representatives themselves must be sufficiently familiar with the circumstances of the industry concerned, and of the dispute, to be able to thresh the matter ov4 as between one set of bargainers and another.",45,Brennan

My own experience suggests that there is infinitely more good accomplished of a permanent character, and much more rapid decisions obtained by conciliation committees of this kind, than in the atmosphere of formalism which prevails in a court. The decision of the High Court seems not only to trench on the settled decision of this Parliament, but has the effect of malting the system of arbitration itself of skill and other considerations. It unworkable. For years past, during what we may call the prosperous years enjoyed by Australia, honourable members opposite were steadfast upholders of the arbitration system. When economic conditions were favorable, and the competition for labour was so keen that the workers, by direct action, would have been able to win standards of living superior to those granted by the court, honourable members on the other side insisted, time after time, upon the strict observance of the law, and the preservation of the arbitration system. During the decade between 1919 and 1929, they always insisted that the trade unions should respect the court, and that there should be no attempt to regulate industrial conditions other than through the court. All through those years the Arbitration Court functioned on the old "" Harvester "" formula. The capacity of industry to pay high wages was a factor never taken into account by the presiding workers' standard of living was fixed. did the basic wage vary so much? only variation was in the margin for skill, and the seeming variations in the The basic wage were due to fixing varying periods of computation. In some cases, the adjustments were made on a quarterly basis, and in others on an annual basis. These committees will function All the time, however, the Arbitration Court sought to fix the basic wage on the 1907 basis of 7s. a day, with such adjustI t is astonishing to me to see ments as were required by variations in the cost of living. A ll the dissatisfaction among trade unionists was due to the fact that, while every other section of the community was enjoying unprecedented prosperity, while palatial buildings were being erected in every city, while the dividends of industrial corporations and of banks were each year becoming higher, they themselves and their families could look forward to nothing more than a. basic wage fixed in accordance with the 1907 standards. If they gained anything at all over and above that standard it was because they were able to establish margins in respect would be possible to quote numerous authorities to show that when honourable members opposite were upholding the Arbitration Court, and insisting upon the observance of 'its awards, the employers refused to confer with the unions, telling them,, when they applied for improved conditions, to go to the Arbitration Court. The workers were tied to the Arbitration Court, and honourable members opposite fought the 1925 election on the principle of arbitration, and the inviolability of its awards. They attempted to establish the principle that no improvement of working conditions could be obtained except through the court. Now, when conditions are reversed, and when the court might be used as a check upon the downward drift of the workers' standard of living, honourable members speak of it as a restriction on the free operation of industry. They say that it is imperative that industry should have the shackles removed.",46,Brennan

Were it not for the fact that the High Court declared section 33, and the greater part of section 44, to be invalid, the Government would have no need to bring this amending bill before the House now. Are we to permit the High Court, by majority decision, to defeat the wishes of .Parliament, especially when we bear in mind that the majority decisions of the. High Court are not always right? cision was reached by a four-to'-one majority. At least one member of the High Court bench-the most competent body to advise the Government-declare d that the sections were valid; and the fact that four other judges declared them to be invalid, affects the law, it"" is true, but those four judges may reverse their decision before twelve months have elapsed. It would not be the first time that the court had done so. There is no finality regarding High Court decisions on industrial matters defined in our Constitution. I ask the House to. pass the second reading of this amending bill. It is true Kooyong( Mr Latham) was that, during this period of difficulty, the probability is that the Arbitration Court will continue to reduce wages. It will do so because it has been attracted to the philosophy that the way to meet a period of adversity is to give the workersless. As one writer has put it, during a time of adversity any crime can be committed against the poor, and the test of its effectiveness is the extent to which they may be bluffed into accepting it. In this period of economic difficulty, if we are to avoid the experiences of the 'nineties, we must provide machinery that will at least put some check upon those who would take advantage of the fact that the workers are subjected to particularly severe competition. With 300,000 persons out of work, it will be impossible for the trade unionists, through their organizations, or as individuals, to effectively resist the attack upon their standards of living. If honourable members. I do not know that opposite believe that cheapness is the remedy for the present industrial problem, and that the lower the wages fall the more unemployed will be given work, let ""them consider what has happened in Australia during the last year. In proportion as wages have fallen, the number of unemployed has increased, and that has been the experience . of every country.

I refuse to allow the High Court to determine whether or not this Parliament shall give Australia a form of arbitration which the Parliament believes to be wise. Having our powers to some extent disturbed by the judicial authority of the High Court, we are entitled to seek to overcome what is regarded as an illegality. ringah) [8.47] -Before dealing with the clauses of the bill, I propose to make some observations regarding utterances by the members of the Labour party who have already spoken on this measure. It will be remembered that the matter raised by this bill was a subject of supreme importance at the last election; in fact it was the main issue on which the election was fought. The Labour party did not seek a detailed mandate;' it asked for and obtained permission to remove from arbitration the legal entanglements with which it was said to be surrounded. .But that did not give the party opposite the right to take from the judges of the courts"" fewer men than were recently employed. the powers that they now exercise, and to surround the conciliation committees with all the legal entanglements that it, presumably, desires to remove. It admitted, when the bill came back from the conference of managers held last year, that the principle of arbitration, for which it had a mandate, was definitely established in the measure, which it then accepted. Now, because the Arbitration Court has given a certain decision, the Government, at this most inopportune time, asks for authority to take from the court all the powers which it now possesses, and to give them to the conciliation committees. I do not intend to refer to the speech delivered by the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) except to say that it was a tirade of abuse against capitalism and employers. The honourable member dug up the age-worn and motheaten slogans with which Labour agitators and soap-box orators have tickled the ears of electors for the last quarter of a century, and which have not the slightest application to present day conditions. He went on to refer to perjurers giving evidence before the court. It is easy for him, in his coward's castle, to refer to decent citizens as perjurers; but his statements do not do him credit. The most impressive aspect of the speech of the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane) was its clumsiness, and the reckless way in which he handled what he claimed to be the facts of the situation. He' said that the Transport Workers Act had put out of employment some 11,000 unionists, most of whom were returned soldiers. That statement is entirely inaccurate. The honourable member does not seem to realize that such maritime industries as have not been destroyed under the tariff policy of the present Government are still being carried on. If , as the honourable member claimed, 21,000 men have been dismissed from the State railways owing to the operation of industrial laws, it clearly shows that they were superfluous. As every one knows, the railway systems of this country are being conducted as usual. There has been no appreciable reduction of the services rendered, yet the honourable member has the temerity to say that they are being conducted witb 21,000 Was there ever such an indictment of our railway systems than to say that before the Labour party came into power, and put the present Arbitration Act into operation, the railway systems of Australia had superimposed on them 21,000 men whose services to day are not re: quired, although a full service is being provided? Eitheri t is not true that so many railway men have lost their employment, or employment had been given to 21,000 more men than were needed for the economic conduct of the railways. Similarly illogical reasoning was apparent in all the arguments advanced by the honourable member. If there was any justification for the advocacy of this bill by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin), it was his statement that the conciliation committees would not be encumbered by barristers and others who he alleges delay the proceedings of the court, because the committees would be composed of practical men who would deal with industrial matters without the ""entangling legalisms"" -to use a phrase coined by the",49,Brennan
220,Mr Archdale Parkhill (War,"Labour party-tba t have for so long handicapped our arbitration system. Under the act passed at the instance of the Attorney-General( Mr Brennan), the duties and powers of the conciliation committees are clearly set out, but we are told that the committees have been unable to operate, because there is no provision for inquiring into and investigating a disit was asked to make by this Government. pute. Section 23 provides that the court ""shall, in such manner as it thinks fit, carefully and expeditiously hear, inquire into, and investigate every industrial discourts constituted of one judge were pute"" and that proposal was supported by the honourable member for Eremantle. So the court had all the familiar legal paraphernalia. It had the power to call witnesses, and was surrounded by all the legal entanglements so objectionable to the Government. But, on examining the bill before the House, and the powers with which it is now proposed to clothe the conciliation committees, I find that they are "" to hear, inquire into, and investigate the industrial dispute "". Those are the identical words employed in the present act. What is the use of the honourable member for Eremantle saying that the proceedings before the conciliation committees will be simple, and that they will be free from the customary paraphernalia of a court? with these powers, in order to enable them to act as conciliation commissioners. course I realize that. My whole argument is that the Government is seeking to give to the conciliation committees the same powers which our arbitration courts at present exercise. It is for this very reason that the arguments of the honourable member for Eremantle are misleading. The passage of this bill is not likely to remove the legal paraphernalia from our arbitration system. Why is the Government seeking to take this power from the judges of the courts? It cannot be because the judges are overworked. On the 15th July -the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) asked the talked by some honourable memAttorney-General( Mr Brennan) the "" bers opposite, who have alleged following question:On how many days since 1st February last wage and the wage standards generhave (a) the Full Court of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and (6) single judges of ally of this country. Such statements are that court, sat for the hearing of matters? The reply was as follows:Since 1st February last , the sittings of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration are as follow:-Ful l Court, 44 days; court constituted by a single judge, 47 days. During those 44 days the Eull Court was engaged on the basic wage inquiry, which Had it not been for that case the judges would have been out of work for the whole 22 weeks except for the 47 days on which sitting. If the powers now proposed to be invested in conciliation committees are taken away from the judges of the court, they will have still less to do. These gentlemen have been appointed for life at the request of the trade unions of this country. If the Government were honest it would say, "" The object of this bill is. to take away from the judges of the Arbitration Court all the power they now possess, and leave them free for the rest of their natural lives."" That would be the real effect of the measure if it were passed. Some honourable members opposite havestated that I am opposed to industrial arbitration, but that is not true. I realize that the workers of this country are just as entitled to combine for their own protection as the employers are entitled to> combine for their protection. I have always considered that some form of arbitration was necessary to protect fair minded employers from their more rapacious brethren. There are rapacious people in every walk of life. I also believe that a simple form of arbitration should be provided for the settlement of industrial problems as between employers and employees. But I am entirely opposed to the vesting of all our arbitration power in conciliation committees. Judicial power should be exercised by judicial bodies. It would be pernicious for us to accept the proposals of the Government in this connection. A lot of nonsense has been recently that our arbitration machinery is being used to destroy the basic ridiculous. We are simply facing facts.",50,Brennan

Certain objections to details were taken in committee, but the principal features of the measure were approved by all parties.

But legal court. I understand from the speech the Government is within its rights in inof the Attorney-General, and the general troducing this measure if it thinks fit. We are entitled to examine the merits of the bill, but not to oppose it merely beis to make the conciliation committees as cause it is an arbitration measure introfree as possible of legal trappings, and in duced by the Government. What are the merits of the bill? According to the honourable member for Warringah they are very few. But he is in an anomalous position in having to vote in support of his own views, when he is for the moment a political bedfellow of the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini). I do not know whether the honourable member for Werriwa will consistently stand up to the speech he delivered this afternoon, but any man with a spark of political decency in him, who denounced the bill and the Government as he did, should have the honesty to vote against the measure. The objections stated by the honourable member for Warringah are worthy of examination. That which appealed to me most was that if these conciliation committees are vested with the full powers at present possessed by the Arbitration Court there will be no work for the federal industrial judges. made by the honourable member for Warringah that impressed me. At a time when the Government is economizing right and left, to give the Arbitration Court a light job doing practically nothwe shall have the right to point that out ing would be indefensible. plated. for a moment that it is. The Governsee fit. After all, this Parliament is ment must recognize that in the present temper of the country such a state of affairs would not be tolerated; if I thought that the effect of this measure would be to give three or four industrial judges a lifelong holiday I would have no alternative but to vote against it. But the judges to do in their industrial and other jurisdictions. Therefore, I put that criticism aside. Another objection by the honourable member for Warringah was that the conciliation committees would have all the attitude of the ministerial party, that that is not intended. The Government's idea view of the mandate which the Government has, we must accept that assurance rather than take the risk, of opposing the Government's main policy, which is to place federal arbitration on an improved and more efficient basis. The honourable member for Warringah stated-as a fatal objection to the bill.that it is in an attempt to go behind the judges of the Federal Arbitration Court. That objection is not valid, because, after all, the judges are not the masters of the country. The Federal Parliament is the final authority. The Arbitration Court is not the High Court; it has no power to interpret the Constitution. The functions of arbitration judges are wholly and solely industrial, and any determinations they make in regard to industrial problems are surely subject to the consideration of this Parliament. If it determines that it will experiment in a direction opposite to the judgment or wishes of those gentlemen, it has every right to do so. Conciliation is essentially part of the policy on which the Government won to po.wer at the. last general election, and for tactical reasons, if for no others, members of the Opposition, are bound to afford to the Government every chance to translate its policy into action.

If the Government is making the mistake of vesting in these committees too much power and taking too much from the judges, that error can operate for only a shOrt time, because within the next twelve months we shall have an opportunity to state our views to the people, and if they think we have proved our case, all the the Government is now doing can be undone. I very much approve of the principle of conciliation as opposed to legal arbitration. which the Government proposes to set up, will be free of that legal atmosphere of which the honourable member for Warringah is so much afraid. It would be a great pity if the lawyers got a stranglehold on them. I know the value of conciliation in .some industries, particularly printing. That industry has never been governed by an award of the Arbitration Court. It has always been governed by agreements arrived at by conciliation and subsequently registered by the court. fore there is no need for the proposed conciliation committees. system of conciliation agreements has been in operation, and the printing industry desires it to continue. Whether these conciliation committees will introduce new elements totally different from those to which the printing industry is accustomed, experience alone will prove, but I take it for granted that the Government's desire is to make the committees a genuine instrument of arbitration on the basis of round table conferences between employers and employees. The great merit I see in this proposal, as opposed to the submission of sectional disputes to the Arbitration Court, is that the industry concerned can be dealt with by men who are experts in it, or who are closely associated with it. That is the fundamental merit of conciliation as opposed to the ordinary legal industrial arbitration. What does a judge know of the printing industry, or railway work, or butchering? He can only form a judgment on the evidence before him, and the opinions of experts, but in a conciliation system the elect of the industry gather about a conference table. The workers are represented by men in whom they have confidence, who have had long association with the industry. Employers may choose representatives noted for their reliability and knowledge of the industry. Under the Government's proposals, if the representatives of the parties fail to agree, the chairman, who is to be an independent person appointed by the Government, will have the right to give an award. The margin of disagreement between the parties may be very, small, but there must be finality in arbitration I assume that the committees as in everything else. If we do not provide machinery for ending a deadlock, we shall get nowhere. To what extent would ParUament be able to function if it lacked machinery for the ending of deadlocks? It is quite possible that two parties to a hearing before a conciliation committee would be unable to agree on some vital issue. If all the time and money expended at the conference were to be wasted'by referring the matter to the Arbitration Court, what would be the use of the conciliation machinery? The case might as well have gone to the court in the first instance. One of the fatal defects of the original conciliation schemes in New South Wales, and other States, was the absence of machinery for final determinations. Lacking that, the people considered that the best thing to do was to brush aside the intervening conciliation tribunals and have straight-out judicial arbitration. We are now getting back to conciliation. In normal times the arbitration court is overloaded. One of the cries at the last federal election was due to the fact that the Federal. Arbitration Court could not handle the work that was crowding upon it. That position does not exist to-day, but it may come about later. In this bill we overcome that difficulty. We bring the machinery for arbitration closer to the employers and employees. If we are to give them any machinery at all, it must be effective. Unless we appoint a chairman who has the power to make an award in the event of no agreement being come to between the parties to a particular dispute, these conciliation committees will effect no good purpose; there must be some court of appeal. I understand-althoug h it is",53,Brennan

This measure power to make an award. Eor the last fifteen years no award has been made in the printing industry. It will be only in exceptional cases that the chairman will need to go over the heads of the other members of the committee and make an award. In the event of a ""further dispute, appeal will be made to the Federal Arbitration Court. This system of conciliation is well worth trying. A judgment of the High Court undoubtedly destroyed the value of the Government's proposals and, as it did get a mandate at the last election to establish some form of conciliation, and to try to improve the arbitration system, I consider'that it is justified in introducing this bill to valicause I considered that if certain date the previous measure, and to carry out what is a new experiment so far as Australia is concerned, in the hope that we may approach somewhere near the ideal system of bringing the employer and employee amicably togethera system, about which we have heard so much during the last ten or fifteen years. It is unnecessary for me at this stage to speak of the general subject of arbitration. I am sorry that certain members on this side of the House, and particularly in this corner, have intimated that they are opposed to compulsory arbitration. I do not think that we can institute any other system of arbitration. with the exception of New Zealand, get on without such a system? member has given his personal view, but he is not speaking for the Country party as a whole.

Green), Forrest( Mr Prowse), and Swan( Mr Gregory) have expressed views limilar to that of the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen). their own personal views. Even the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) has said that he in favour of arbitration, and I presume that he was speaking for himself and not for his party. The arbitration policy of the Country party has not been altered since should receive the support of honourable members on this side of the House. We cannot say at this stage what effect it will have upon industry. The system must ^ be thoroughly tried before we can condemn it. I urge honourable members on this side of the House who supported the Government last year when the previous measure was introduced, not to go back on their tracks by opposing this measure. unable to support this measure, because last year when I sat behind the Government I crossed the floor of the House and voted against the previous measure, beamendments proposed by another place were accepted by the Government, the bill would be spoilt altogether.. However, the Government was prepared to accept them, and-they were incorporated in the bill without consulting the wishes of caucus and against the wishes of five honourable members, myself included. While this amending bill is a slight improvement upon that measure, still it does not come up to the expectations of the workers, whom the Government is supposed to represent. I have listened with interest to the arguments of honourable members on both sides of the House, particularly those of the Attorney-General( Mr Brennan). It was particularly interesting to hear the views of honourable members who recently helped this Government to reduce the wages of public servants, the old-age and invalid pensions, and the maternity allowance,' iu>. that process totally disregarding the principle of arbitration.

The article is headedGovernment's Further Attempt. Another endeavour has been made by tlie Labour party to have the judges of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court supplanted to a large extent by lay arbitrators. . . . When the amending Commonwealth Consideration by the Federal Parliament last August, it contained provisions which aimed at ousting the jurisdiction of the court in respect of all matters except the fixing of a basic wage and standard hours, as well as the tion of penalties. The making of awards outside the basic wage, and standard hours, was to be placed in the hands of conciliation committees with conciliation commissioners. Employers all over the Comtransfer the work of making awards from independent and learned judges to conciliation commissioners who might be biassed, and incompetent Labour officials. In a spirit of principle of conciliation committees and commissioners being authorized to make awards on securing the right of dissidence against an In due course one commissioner was appointed and several conciliation committees of the time (Senator Daly), and not because employers wanted them. As short because of a majority judgment of Court declaring that certain powers the act, and the complete authority of the Arbitration Court as to the making or vary-",56,Brennan

246,Mr White,"That is so, but I were formed at the instance of the acting-which, fortunately, the Senate rejected w it h some few exceptions. The article continuesTlie Ministry is not to be trusted. It has to dance to the tunc set by the Trades Hall Council and the caucus. If these dictators demand the appointment of extremists as conciliation commissioners, it will have to be doue. It is just as well to keep in mind what has happened in New South Wales recently. In that State, Mr E. C. McGrath, secretary of the Printing Industry Employees TJnion, has been appointed Deputy Industrial Commissioner. . . . Vacancies on industrial committees had been tilled by the appointment of two of the "" red "" section, Mr J. Hooke, president of the Sydney Labour Council, and Mr finitesimal when compared with the losses S. Bird, formerly general secretary of the State Labour party. It is apparent from these comments that the employers do not approve of the appointment of conciliation committees. They know only too well to what extent industry has been hampered ever since the establishment of the Arbitration Court which has been used so often for the creation of .disputes. has thrived. industry was able to pay the high rate of wages ordered by the Arbitration Court, although, in many instances, the awards were unsatisfactory from the employers' point of view. organizations were always ready to accept favorable awards, but whenever the decision of the court went against them, they defied it and went on strike. We all recall the serious industrial trouble which resulted from the finding of Judge Beeby in even such a comparatively minor matter as the waterside workers' case. The men were induced to strike and, for a time, there were scenes of violence on the wharfs and several instances of bombing of the homes of the volunteer workers. The outcome of that industrial upheaval was the introduction, by the then Attorney-General( Mr Latham), of the Transport Workers Act, which the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane) has alleged, quite unfairly, was responsible for the unemployment of a also large body of waterside workers, includHouse ing a number of returned soldiers. The of honourable member for Bendigo went on to unfai r to the workers. In the light of say that the former Attorney-General what has happened during the last two was the real enemy of the workers. So years, I feel sure that if an appeal were far fro m that being true, I have no hesitanow made to the people on the industrial tion in declaring that the Transport Workers Act is one of the most beneficial pieces of legislation ever placed on our statute-book. It brought peace to the waterfront and ensured continuity in employment to a large number of willing workers. protection ? can get that information for himself. Buti t is safe to say that the cost in curred for police protection was in due to idle ships and seamen out of employment, due to industrial unrest for some years prior to the passing of that, act. The Premier of Victoria( Mr -. Hogan) pointed out in the press and in-, the Victorian Parliament that on thatoccasion. the men were misled by unionleaders who wished to aggrandize their own position in their organization, and that, in fact, their views were entirely opposed to those of the majority of the men concerned. The only offence of the volunteers was that they wished to have In prosperous years the right to work, and that they refused to bow the knee to any industrial dictator, communistic term the honourable member for East Sydney( MrW a r d ), and those associated with him in the corner, would call those men whose only offence was a desire to work under an award of the"" Arbitration Court. The honourable member for Bendigo also said that a considerable number of returned soldiers wore being displaced on the waterfront. On that point I remind h im that I was informed, in reply to a question which I put to the Government, that 25 per cent, of the volunteer labourers were returned soldiers, excluding those of foreign birth, some of whom may also have been returned soldiers. So much for the Transport Workers Act.

252,Industrial Mr White,"I know what fou lpolicy of this Government, there would be no doubt as to the verdict. No one can deny that during the last election campaign the industrial policy of the Bruce-Page Government was grossly misrepresented. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin), whose eloquence so often cloaks his real meaning, was assistant director of publicity on that occasion. I do not propose to detail the many promises that were made to the electors, and the other extraneous issues that were raised, with the object of mis-i shows that, in spite of all his eloquence, leading the people; but it is not wide of the truth to say that soon after the campaign opened the arbitration policy of the Bruce-Page Government became a matter of secondary importance. The intention then was to leave the settlement of disputes in"" the smaller industries to the States. That this is necessary was impressed upon me only this week in connection with the indenturing of apprentices. The Victorian Government has decided that the intention of the original act shall be adhered to, so that we shall have an apprentice working 48 hours a week, while a journeyman engineer or blacksmith to whom he may be apprenticed will, under a recent award, work only 44 hours. It is that sort of ridiculous overlapping and interference with employers in the conduct of their business that has brought industry to its present sorry plight. We all know that there are world-wide economic difficulties at the present time, and problems of production and consumption to be overcome, but one of the most serious handicaps to business to-day is the operation of our idealistic arbitration system. Aristotle said in B.C. 384The insolence of demagogues is generally wealth, why should it be necessary to the cause of the ruin of democracies. i That is perfectly true to-day. If it were ing their travelling allowances and other not for the hundreds of federal union secexpenses ? retaries who are holding industry by the throat, business would have freer play, and the number of unemployed would be less. We should not then have the specsomething under its rehabilitation plan by tacle of scores of unemployed men sitting reducing abnormal governmental expendiin the public galleries of this House every ture, nothing which has as yet been put night, and the thousands of unemployed before us will result in providing work in the cities, and those walking the roads for even one man. Expenditure is being of the country, could be provided with reduced, but employment is not being proprofitable occupation. members opposite seem to regard arbiplementing the Government's plan are Ur. White. tration as something sacrosanct; something which no one should dare to criticize. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin) said that he believed in conciliation, that it was right that the representatives of both sides in industry should meet in conference to settle their disputes. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) reminded him that such action is provided for in the existing Arbitration Act. The honourable member denied that assertion, which he knows very little about the subject he has been discussing. Section 24 of the Arbitration Act makes full provision for conciliation proceedings, and honourable members opposite who have been union secretaries or organizers, must know that accommodation is provided in the offices of the Chamber of Manufactures in all the cities for the meeting of conciliation committees in regard to any dispute in an industry. Upon numerous occasions arrangements have been come to, agreeable to both sides, and these agreements have been registered in the Arbitration Court, and have thus become law. The act lays. down certain limitations in respect of such agreements, but, broadly speaking, provision exists for the settlement of practically all disputes by conciliation. I was surprised that the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson), with all his experience, should support the Government's proposal for setting up conciliation committees, on the ground that a satisfactory agreement had been arrived at in the printing trade by means of conciliation. If agreements can be arrived at by means of round-table conferences, and as he suggested, without expense to the Commonset up conciliation committees under the act, and commit the Government to payAlthough the Government will achieve Some honourable vided, and when the present bills for impassed, I sliould like to ' see another Premiers Conference held with a view to arriving at some real solution of the unemployment problem. I have no desire that anything should be done to hamper industry still more, or to further shackle and harass employers who are, in most instances, already carrying on at a loss; but it should be possible for s. conference attended by representatives of employers and delegates of the workers to evolve some satisfactory plan. :necessarily be represented by union demagogues who, by virtue of their oratory, have secured, for themselves a following, but should send to the conference representatives directly associated with the trades concerned. When we remember that wool and wheat are now selling at approximately 1911 prices, end that wages are twice what they were in 1911, it must be evident that, the country is drifting to insolvency. Our greatest enemy at the present time is drift. We cannot hope that prosperity will return if we merely ait with folded arms, and content ourselves with making a few cuts in expenditure. The seriousness of the position is evident when we realize that the Premier of New South Wales, with his policy ofrepudiation, is supported by representatives in this Blouse, and that even the -Government is so closely associated with communists-wh o form a nucleus in every trade union, which was the boast of the New South. Wales Premier's adviser, Mr Garden, when in Moscowthat it will not openly denounce these supporters. must take action to provide work for the unemployed. The Attorneyd-eneral ( Mr Brennan) will be wise to abandon this proposal for setting up conciliation committees, which have had 'little enough to do in the past. The Arbi-. -tration Court judges can do all that is necessary. I oppose this measure, because it would, if passed, prove quite ineffective, and would still further harass industry. I intend to vote against the bill. I should not have spoken on this bill, but for the re-appearance in the chamber of the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr urged that the best way to accomplish Keane). It is to answer the remarks he made earlier that I have now risen to speak. Many unexpected things have happened in the party on the other side of the House during the last few weeks, and we on this side have almost lost our capacity for astonishment; but not the least surprising' thing is to hear from the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane) and the honourable member for Fremantle. ( Mr Curtin) a justification of the policy of the Bruce-Page Government in 1929. The workers need not Both honourable members criticized the former Attorney-General and the Bruce Page Government, and yet both of them substantially supported the policy on which that Government went to the country. They both referred to the desirability of getting rid of legal disputation, .and to the time-wasting methods of which the arbitration system is full. They also agreed that we should avoid the expense attached to the working of the arbitration system. The honourable member for Bendigo said that the conciliation committees would be representative of employers and employees, and would be the means of bringing them into close touch with one another; that they would deal with each other, instead of going to a third party-the Arbitration Court. In that way, it was urged, time would be saved, and common-sense determination would be arrived at by men who understood the technicalities of the industry instead of by judicial men who might, or might not, know very much about the actual working of the business concerned. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr The Government Keane) said that quick decisions would be given, based on first-hand knowledge. The honourable member's remarks were almost identical with words which I used in 1929 when supporting the policy of the Bruce-Page Government.. It would appear that the honourable member for Bendigo had been reading my speech before he spoke. When the Bruce-Page Government went to the. country in 1929, its supporters told the electors that they desired to get rid of legal disputations, imposing tremendous expense on both employer and employee, and to dispense with the atmosphere of litigation as well as duplication, and overlapping. We those ends was by abolishing the system",58,Arbitration Bill Superseding The Judges

I then stood for the retention of the court, and the act by which it was created; I was opposed to handing over arbitration matters to the States. I submit that, in view of the mandate it received, the Government has a perfect right to bring before Parliament amending arbitration legislation.

For example, the most important amendment provides that if this agreement, which is made in accordance with the financial agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the States on the 12th December, 1927, conflicts in any way with this agreement, this agreement shall prevail. The other amendments are merely of a technical character. As the Debt Conversion Bill, in which all the principles of this proposal are embodied, has been fully debated, there is no need to discuss the schedule at length. The alterations in the present schedule have been made after consultation with the Loan Council, and the Commonwealth and State law olficers. The agreement has been signed by me, as Prime Minister, and by the Premiers of the States, and the Debt Conversion Agreement Bill will be proclaimed when similar measures have been passed by the State Parliaments. The Debt Conversion Bill will also be proclaimed at the same time. -The schedule consists of what is termed an agreement, which, in my opinion, is not an agreement, and is not in accordance with the provisions of-. Act No. 1 of 1928, entitled, "" The Constitution Alteration-Stat e Debts Act 1928"". Nor does it meet the requirements of section 105A of the Constitution. There is not the slightest doubt that the Financial Emergency Bill has already been enacted. When that bill, under which the salaries of public servants, the pensions of the invalid, the aged and the destitute and the returned soldiers have been reduced, was under discussion, we were informed that the bondholders would of the burden, but as this schedule is worded, they may not be compelled to do so. I contend that this is not a legal agreement, and that under section 105A of the ©onstitution it will be declared invalid by the High Court. In any circumstances, we should study it closely, to determine whether it is, or is not, actually an agreement. If it is not an agreement, a person holding a £1,000 bond falling due on the 15th December, 1931, who has not taken the trouble to dissent under the Debt Conversion Bill, may claim that he is entitled to his money because the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the States was not in fact an agreement, and consequently does not bind him. I understand that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham), in endeavouring to assist the Government, has diecussed this matter with the legal advisers of the Government. I merely wish to place on record my protest against the adoption of what, in my opinion, is not an agreement, and, if passed in its present form, will prove ineffective. . A person whose bond is due for redemption on the 15th December, 1931, who has not dissented, will have the right to claim his money because the terms of the Constitution have not been complied with. In the agreement the words "" et cetera"" are used. They were objected to by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but they still remain in clauses 4 and 13. They may, or may not, cover treasury bills, deposit receipts, debentures, or inscribed stock. The same expression is also' used in the recital to the agreement which may also be very dangerous. In clause 6 of the schedule we find these words-""As a general rule each holding to be spread equally over the ten maturity dates . . . "" In my opinion the words",63,Sales Tax Assessment Bills 1931

If I were asked to, advise a client I would tell h i m he was not' bound by the terms of this agreement. I do not think that the Commonwealth or the States are bound by it . I do not think that the. agreement meets the requirements of section 1 0 5 A of the Constitution. consideration of this matter has been held up for a fortnight with the object of putting the agreement into better form than that in which it was submitted to the Premiersf o r signature. There has been time for a thorough revision of it , and for the removal of all indefinitenees from it . I do not think that that in definiteness has been removed, and I wash my hands of it . member suggest that the agreement is invalid as to construction, or as to prin ciple ? construction is bad. It w ill not be binding upon the parties, because of its indefiniteness. One amendment of an important nature has been made, alUnder the heading of "" Loan though the Prime Minister stated that there had been no serious alteration in it . In its original form the bill contained no provision such is required by Act No. 1 of 1929 for the indemnification of the Commonwealth by the Statesi n respect of debts taken over by the Commonwealth. That point is now covered by paragraph 5 of the operative words. I shall not delay the committee further than to repeat that if a client came to me on the 16th December next for advice as to the obligation of the Government to redeem his securities, I would advise him that he would have good grounds for suing tlie Commonwealth for his money. When this measure was previously before the committee I criticized various passages in the agreement, which I said was so vague, indefinite, and uncertain as not to amount to an agreement. I gave several reasons for holding that opinion. Those reasons have disappeared, because of the amendments that have been made to the agreement. If honourable members w ill look at the bill in its original for m they w ill see that there was a reference in it to the conversion of certain debts "" on the following conditions, namely"". Those conditions were then set out in the draft-the rough draft, as I pointed out -submitte d to the Premiers Conference. Following upon the recital, there came the recital that an agreement for authorizing the conversion of the debts in accordance with those conditions, The which were indefinite and uncertain. They included, for instance, the use of the words, "" et cetera,"" at least twice. They also provided for the settlement of certain matters in consultation with the banks, and for the determination of certain other matters by the Loan Council.

I also pointed out that in the form in which it was originally submitted the agreement provided that the conditions might be modified in any manner Approved by the Loan Council or the chairman of the Loan Council acting on the authority of the Loan Council. But the provisions of the agreement which I regarded as uncertain and vague have been amended, and it is now possible to identify the terms upon which the conversion is to take place. something to do with the drafting of these amendments in conjunction with the legal advisers of the Government. That is not a normal procedure, but it seemed to me that this matter was so important that if I were able from my experience to offer any assistance it was my duty to offer it, and I did so gladly. I point out in reference to the remarks QWU debts has been retained. It is proof the honourable member for Corangavided in this regard thatmite ( Mr Crouch) that the agreement has been altered at the end of the second ment, iecital to read as follows:that a conversion should be arranged of the internal public debts of the Commonwealth and of the States and the following conditions were provisionally agreed upon as 5-eoommendations by the conference to the Australian Loan Council, namelyI t is in the section of the agreement which follows, that the words "" et cetera"" are used. There is still uncertainty and in-definiteness in the statement of those general conditions in the recital, but they were actually the conditions agreed to by the conference. The operative clauses of the agreement follow, and they now completely identify the terms of the conversion. The language of the agreement in that connection is as follows:And whereas the said conditions with cert a in modifications have been embodied in a bill for an act to be known as the Commonwealth Debt Conversion Act 1931 which has Consideration resumed from the 10th July been passed by both Houses of the Federal (vide page 3747) and from the 15th Parliament and is ready for presentation to July (vide page 3908) on motions by is hereinafter referred to as the said act: The actual terms of the conversion are -stated in the Commonwealth Debt Conversion Act. The recital goes on to say, in this connexionAnd whereas there have been incorporated going resolutions. in the said act additional provisions deemed to be convenient for carrying .out the said .conditions as so modified as aforesaid. Mr Latham. Those conditions are, in brief, that the Commonwealth is authorized to arrange and effect a conversion of the public debts in accordance with the terms and conditions of ""sections 3, 8 and 10 to 22 inclusive of the said act of all public debts of the States "". It will be realized, therefore, that the precise terms of the conversion are now specified in the agreement. I have had gentleman now of the opinion that the agreement meets all constitutional requirements ? points that I raised, or that I have heard raised, have been covered. I point out, also, that an additional provision has been inserted with the object of ensuring that the liability of the States for their the provisions of the said financial agreeand the undertakings and obligations of the Commonwealth and of the States therein contained, shall apply to the public debts after the conversion in the same manner as they applied before the conversion. I think that all the points raised in criticism of the original agreement have been met; but I do not profess to give an absolute guarantee of validity. The agreement is as sound as I can see that we can make it. That is surely all that I can. reasonably be expected to say. Amendment agreed to. Schedule, as amended, agreed to.

It would appear, therefore, that the advantage accruing to Australia under this treaty disappears by reason of its very generality. honourable member learn this ? the reports of the debates in the Canadian Parliament. The Canadian Minister said that, in connection with South Africa and New Zealand, the treaties could be arranged by proclamation, but that in the case of the Australian treaty it was necessary for legislation to bo passed, and. that the reason for the delay that had taken place was 'financial embarrassment in Australia. If that be so, we are really only getting from Canada rights that are being given to other countries. the honourable member that that'is not so.
