Wednesday, 25 June 2003 ----Human Rights: National Action Plan lia’s national action plan on human rights at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. National action plans were a recommendation of the 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights, having been suggested by the Australian government as a means by which countries could in a practical way improve their observance of human rights standards. Australia’s plan was a clear statement of the steps being taken to promote and protect the human rights of Australian citizens. It was intended that the plan be comprehensively revised every five years. Over time, Australia has encouraged other countries to develop plans, particularly in our neighbourhood of the Asia-Pacific region. In 1998, Indonesia published its plan, which was a welcome achievement. Also in 1998, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General both announced that Australia would comprehensively revise our own plan. A working group was established and an extensive process of consultation was promised. That was almost five years ago. Since then, Australians have seen and heard absolutely nothing. As of last month, the working group had not met for almost a year, and the revised document had not even been considered by the Attorney-General, let alone forwarded to the stakeholders for consultation. Quite clearly, the national action plan has become a national inaction plan. We have heard no explanation from the Attorney-General or the foreign minister for their extraordinary delay. Anyone familiar with the Howard government’s human rights record would understand that they are having some difficulty scraping together their human rights achievements. Perhaps it would assist if I recalled a few. In the last few years, for example, the Howard government has voted against the UN protocol against torture; continued to deny Australian women the benefit of the UN protocol for the elimination of discrimination against women; and introduced legislation to weaken Australia’s national human rights body, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, and to sack its specialist commissioners. I suspect that if the government is honest the national action plan, when it finally appears, will read something like a confession. Naturally the government’s failure to produce a revised plan weakens Australia’s argument that other countries should develop their own. More importantly, it means there is no clear and contemporary statement of human rights standards that Australians can expect their own government to uphold. Australians are strong supporters of human rights, stemming from our nation’s commitment to a fair go. After five years of inaction, it is time for the Attorney-General to tell the Australian people what on earth is going on about their fundamental human rights.

287,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (9.43 A.m.),"The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority ispressures that it suffers from modern living. A draft plan has been released by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for comment by users of the reef system. Submissions will be required to be received by the authority by the end of the first weekend in August. I am encouraging every user to have a look at the draft plan and, if they would like to make some alternative recommendations, to suggest them to the marine park authority. Last night in Townsville there was a public meeting of recreational fishermen. About 800 attended the entertainment centre. I am sorry that I was unable to be there because parliament was sitting and my duty is of course to be in Canberra when parliament is sitting. However, I encourage the fishermen to put in a submission. If they feel that a little fishing area where they like to fish has been excluded from the current draft plan, if they can give a good reason why fishing there should be allowed, they should make that point to the marine park authority. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has said all along that it will try to balance the needs of all of the users, consistent with the protection of the barrier reef for the next several centuries. To that end, the marine park authority listened to fishermen and included in the draft plan a significant number of yellow zones. That allows recreational fishermen to fish, but not commercial fishermen. That is a sign of the authority’s good faith. The authority will continue to operate in good faith, and there is every reason for fishermen to have confidence when putting a logical argument to the authority and expecting it to be included in the final plan. I am disappointed that the state government of Queensland is yet to make clear either its position on the draft plan or what it might do with the waters that it, not the federal government, controls. The state government must make its position clear, and it must do so quickly, because that might influence the suggestions that respondents might want to put to the authority about how the final plan might be composed. The way ahead is for me to encourage all the users of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to make their views known to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Telstra: Privatisation morning about the capitulation of the once great National Party on the issue of Telstra privatisation. As someone who grew up in a country district and was used to hearing plenty of things about how the National Party-and, before it, the Country Party-was the only defender of country people in parliament at a state or federal level, I have to tell you that this will come as something of a disappointment to many people in rural and regional Australia. It is not a disappointment to me, because I always viewed the role of the Country Party, and following it the National Party, with a great deal of cynicism-and I think I was always right to have had that view about that political party. Wouldn’t it be great if we had a strong leader in the National Party who could stand up for the interests of country people? Wouldn’t it be great if we had someone in there who had some courage, some conviction and some belief and who could stand up for the interests of people living in rural and regional Australia? I look at the new generation of National Party slick politicians-people like the member for Gippsland, Peter McGauran, and the National Party leader, John Anderson-who all went to elite category 1 schools in big cities, and I look at the background of people like the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Larry Anthony, whose great claim to fame in National Party involvement was being the president of the SydMAIN COMMITTEE",157,Statements By Members

It would be great if we had someone in a leadership position within the National Party who could stand up for the interests of country Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I know that you and many other people share my views about the weakness of the leadership in the National Party. I urge you and other people on the National Party back bench to try to stiffen up the leadership of the National Party so that we might be able to get decent services for rural people living in country Australia. I note that the price that the National Party has extracted from the Howard government for the full sale of Telstra is around $100 million for additional services for country Australia, which means that their share of the total proceeds of the sale of Telstra will be around one-thirtieth. As a country member, Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that you know that country people make up more than one-thirtieth of the population of this country. The National Party is a disgrace, and the leaders are an absolute pack of wimps. (Time expired) Macarthur Electorate: Macarthur Relay for Life tending the Macarthur Relay for Life cheque presentation at Campbelltown Hospital. The Macarthur Relay for Life was the first event to involve sponsored individuals walking, running or in some cases dragging themselves around an athletic oval to raise much needed funds for cancer research. In Macarthur last year we raised over $100,000. Every dollar raised goes towards cancer research which not only improves the quality of life of cancer sufferers but also helps to save lives. On Wednesday, the Cancer Council presented a cheque totalling $40,000 to the Macarthur Relay for Life committee. The money will be held in trust at Campbelltown Hospital to assist in the improvement of cancer services for the people of Macarthur. The Campbelltown Cancer Therapy Centre opened just 3½ months ago and since then has treated over 770 people. Relay for Life is an overnight team event. Last year Macarthur had 39 teams registered, which amounted to 625 participants. The team members took turns at running and walking for a period of 24 hours. We had teams from all parts of the community participating, including Macarthur Ulysses, Campbelltown Line Dancers, the Nasho’s, Plumbers of Macarthur, St Helens Park School and the All-nighters just to name a few. Relay for Life is an opportunity for all of us to celebrate and remember those who have been affected by cancer and also celebrate cancer survivors. Survivors are honoured at the beginning of the Relay for Life by participating in a ceremonial first lap of honour where other participants cheer them and their carers during the survivors walk. This year Macarthur had 31 survivors walk, along with 27 carers. Later in the evening, on dusk, a candlelight ceremony was held where messages were written to loved ones on paper bags. These bags then had a candle placed in them. I cannot properly describe the flood of emotions from all the participants at dusk when the bags, glowing from the candles inside them, combined with a minute’s silence, were then followed by some beautiful music. All of us know someone who has been affected by cancer. Relay for Life started in 1985 when one man, Dr Gordy Klat, put on his jogging gear and went to his local oval after hearing news that a good friend had succumbed to cancer.

Tourism: Tasmania House of the positive movement in tourism related activities in my home state of Tasmania. Bass Strait ferries Spirit of TasmaniaI and II were purchased and put into service last year, carrying up to 1,400 passengers and 100 cars between Melbourne and Devonport. The tourist industry in Tasmania, which includes many operations in my electorate of Lyons, is, I am happy to say, going from strength to strength. Only this week our state Premier, Jim Bacon, announced that a third ferry is to begin operations between Sydney and Devonport, giving fast and comfortable sea access to Tasmania from even further afield. In addition to this, a direct air link between Tasmania and Antarctica is now on the cards, with the recent announcement by the Australian Antarctic Division of the contracting of two planes for Antarctic service. Not only will this increase the help and support that Tasmania already gives to the southern polar operations; it will also increase Hobart’s attractiveness as the premier Antarctic information and resource centre outside Antarctica itself. This will obviously further increase the number of visitors to Tasmania-in fact, a healthy $170 million has come into the state’s economy this financial year and the new initiatives promise to generate even more next year. With tourism numbers up over 15 per cent and the TT-Line having taken over half a million bookings this financial year, many tourist operators are recognising the potential of the island state as a premium tourist destination. At Coles Bay, on the east coast of Tasmania and in my electorate, Federal Hotels and Resorts are planning a new multimillion dollar tourist complex. This is a clear economic boost to both the east coast and the Tasmanian economy. It is up to us to put together the infrastructure needed in these areas that are starting to become the tourist areas of Tasmania. There is a lot of work to be done, but with good sense and a Labor government, such as the good one led by Jim Bacon, I believe that can be achieved. I commend the Tasmanian government and the industrious people of Tasmania for making the most of our beautiful island. However, I was concerned to hear this morning that the National Party has agreed with the Liberals to sell the rest of Telstra. I have been involved for many years in trying to protect rural Australia. I know that you, as a National Party member, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, and people as far back as Black Jack McEwen have been trying to protect regional Australia and have had a lot of difficulties in doing so. I wish you the best of luck in trying to reverse this decision.

Warwick Powell and Chris Byran won a gold medal in the doubles event and Warwick, Chris and Jay Lind from Coomera Anglican College in my electorate, as well as Oliver Blenkin from the Marymount College, won a gold medal in the fours event. They have been compared with the Oarsome Foursome. I congratulate all these young boys. It is certainly a great achievement and something of which they should be extremely proud. I know that the schools which they represent are extremely proud of their efforts and I am sure that their families and friends are also extremely proud of them. I also take this opportunity to congratulate Steven Walmsley, a bright young student from the Logan Village State School in my electorate, who recently won the Spirit of Australia competition. The competition involved preparing a project based on capturing the spirit of ANZAC soldiers. Steven’s project was based on his grandfather, John McCarron, whom I had the pleasure of meeting. John fought in World War II. The project provided a great opportunity for Steven to gain an understanding of what his grandfather went through during the war. Once again, I congratulate Steven, and I also congratulate the secondary school winner Matthew Allen, the primary school winner Jessica O’Brien and the special school winner Kristy Highly. I also congratulate the Beaudesert RSL for hosting such a successful event and one which ensures that the ANZAC spirit remains alive in our younger generations. I was honoured recently to have the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Larry Anthony, visit my electorate to officially launch the Beaudesert Shire Lead On Youth program. This program-developed by Boystown Family Care, Lead On Australia and the Beaudesert Shire Council-is targeted at young people aged between 13 and 25 years. It aims to form stronger links between youth, council, business, community, government agencies and educational institutions in the area. This program provides a great opportunity for young people in the Beaudesert area. It was great to see so many people at the launch-and, in particular, Matt Tomlinson from Beaudesert State High. Matt is the school captain and a member of the steering committee and youth advisory board, and he spoke about projects that were already under way. I also thank the Beaudesert High School band, which provided the entertainment, and the school’s catering department, which prepared and served an extraordinary morning tea. These young people are our future. This program will give them the opportunity to realise their potential and the enormous potential of the Beaudesert shire, and it will also encourage young people to stay in the shire. Whilst in the electorate, Minister Anthony also launched the latest Green Corps project in Jimboomba. I am sure that every member in this House appreciates the work that young people in Australia are doing through this program. This program allows young people the opportunity to receive quality training while participating in projects and addressing significant environmental issues. It was great to meet the latest group of young adults to participate in this project. It is always great to go to their graduations and see the work they have done for our local environment, and also to see how much they have developed within themselves. I wish the participants all the best with their project and I look forward to catching up with them at their graduation later this year. der 275A, the time for members’ statements has concluded.

292,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley),"Order! In accordance with standing orSecond Reading Debate resumed from 6 March, on motion by Mr Abbott: That this bill be now read a second time. Emergency Management Volunteers) Bill 2003 is both welcome and overdue. It is another example of the government playing catch-up. It is another example of Labor leading and the Liberals following. It is another example of Liberal tardiness. Thousands of workers in Australia are left exposed because of this government’s ideological obsession in pursuit of stripping from workers their previous entitlements and rights and ensuring that the Industrial Relations Commission was stripped of its powers to rectify those anomalies. This bill very much follows the position set out in Labor’s private member’s bill of October last year. Had the government accepted Labor’s bill last year, the firefighters involved in last summer’s terrible fires throughout Australia, particularly the disastrous fires here in the ACT, would have known that they had federal legislation to protect their employment. The government refused to act last year when Labor put this bill, as a private member’s bill, before the parliament. We find now, the best part of a year later, the government picking up Labor’s proposal and belatedly but thankfully understanding the importance of protecting the employment status of our volunteer firefighters. Last year when Labor introduced its private member’s bill, the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, said: With the summer bushfire season approaching, we know that we will be facing possibly one of our most difficult fire seasons ever. With the dry and dusty conditions across much of the east coast, our emergency volunteers are waiting, ready for the worse that nature can do. Our brave volunteer firefighters will once again be out in force saving lives and properties. They of course deserve our admiration but, just as importantly, they deserve our support. He was right to say those things last year. He was also quite prophetic in his assessment of the bushfire season that was about to commence over the summer we have just had. Yet this government sat on its hands because of its usual political objections to improving the entitlements of ordinary Australian workers, and it sat on its hands because of its usual approach to things from this side of the parliament, irrespective of their merit. At least the minister was good enough in his second reading speech to, in political speak, acknowledge as much. He said: ... this bill deserves to be marked because it is one of those bills that has come forward into the parliament as a result of some initiatives and statements from members opposite, as well as from some of the instincts and impulses of members on this side of the House. He did not have to worry about the impulses and instincts-whatever they are-of Liberal Party and National Party members. There was a bill in the parliament last October that Labor sponsored to provide this protection. John Howard, Tony Abbott and the government refused to allow its passage through the parliament, leaving firefighters exposed during a fire season in which they should not have been exposed. This is not the first occasion on which a problem of this sort has arisen.

293,Mr Bevis (Brisbane) (9.59 A.m.),"The Workplace Relations Amendment (Protection forstripped from the Industrial Relations Commission its powers to deal with these issues. This bill is here because this government prevents our industrial relations umpire from making these decisions. This bill is here because this government deliberately decided to remove from awards provisions precisely like this. In its legislation under Minister Reith, this government reduced the matters that an industrial award could cover. Prior to that, awards did in fact cover matters of this sort. I cite one example: the Rural Water Industry Award 1994. It had a provision that said under the heading ‘Emergency services leave’: (a) Employees who are registered members of a volunteer organisation who wish to respond to a declared emergency situation may be released from their normal duties without loss of salary to participate in firefighting, flood relief or other emergency activity. Provided that: (1) release for volunteer activity is subject to no undue inconvenience being caused to the administrative unit; (2) satisfactory evidence is provided of an employee’s bona fide involvement in the emergency activity. (b) Leave granted under this clause shall be included as service for the purpose of recreation, sick leave and long service leave. That is a sensible provision adopted by employers and employees in many cases and approved by the industrial umpire. This government not only forced through the parliament a law that prevented the industrial umpire from inserting those provisions in future awards; it passed a law that required all such provisions to be struck from every federal award on the books. This government left naked those volunteer workers around Australia who give their time to protect the community. It did it deliberately and it did it against the fierce opposition of the Labor Party at the time. Liberal Party and National Party members who voted for that knew exactly what they were doing, and they went ahead and took away those sorts of protections to which I have just referred. We will be visiting this matter again because, whilst this bill deals with problems associated with some emergency management, I suspect there will be other classes of people involved whom we will have to revisit-as we did some time ago in relation to Defence Force personnel, a matter that I will touch on shortly. Why, as a parliament, do we have to do that? Because in their 1996 Workplace Relations Act the government inserted a new provision on allowable matters. They restricted allowable matters to these provisions: annual leave and leave loadings; long service leave; and personal and carers leave, including sick leave, family leave, bereavement leave, compassionate leave, cultural leave and other like forms of leave. They stripped away the entitlements that workers had to protection. It should be noted in this debate that the government-Liberal Party and National Party members-are not content with having taken those rights away; they have in the past introduced bills into this parliament to further restrict what can be an allowable matter in an award. They have not yet learnt their lesson from the mistakes of the 1996 act. The government actually want to go further and take out of awards more items that have previously been inserted, thus further reducing the number of allowable matters. Thankfully, this parliament-Labor, Democrat and Independent senators-have previously blocked those bills. But be under no illusions: Liberal Party and National Party members-this government, this minister and his predecessors-are committed to further reductions in those items that can be covered as allowable matters in industrial awards and in those matters upon which the Australian Industrial Relations Commission can make decisions. MAIN COMMITTEE It is because of those actions of Liberal politicians that we are now required to pass laws to give back to workers protections they previously had, and these people certainly deserve that protection. We are talking here, particularly with regard to the fire disasters, about people who put their lives in harm’s way to protect other people and other people’s property, often in very difficult and stressful circumstances, and do it exceedingly well. For that, as Simon Crean said, they deserve our thanks and support. It is a pity that it has taken this government the best part of a year to catch up with Labor’s proposal to provide that support. I mentioned that this is not the first occasion that we have had to play this catch-up game where the Liberal Party seek to put right something that they got wrong years after Labor sought to correct the problem. The other example I referred to was the provision with respect to armed services personnel. It is worth touching on, because it too is a volunteer service critically important to our national well-being that has fallen foul of the same process. In 1998 I raised this matter in the parliament and I moved amendments to government legislation that would have protected workers in their employment when they undertake service as reservists in our Army, Air Force and Navy reserves. This government rejected those proposals. It took three years for the government to bring in their own legislation, in 2001, to provide that protection which I, as shadow minister at the time in 1998, sought to provide to all of those workers. Indeed, when the 1996 bill was being dealt with, this issue was drawn to the attention of the parliament, and Liberal Party and National Party members consciously removed the right of workers to have a clause in awards that protected them when they were on service as reserve soldiers or reserve personnel in the Army, Air Force or Navy. It is a hard proposition for anyone in the community to understand and, in the light of current security issues, quite frightening, yet this government took three years to catch up with Labor’s proposals in that area. If there is some small mercy in the events before us today, it is that the government have managed to catch up with us one year after they should have done it rather than three years after they should have done it. That is cold comfort but will hopefully provide some support to workers in the bushfire season that we expect at the end of this year. I am concerned with one aspect of the bill as I read it. The bill refers to protection of a person’s employment: that is, it makes it unlawful for someone to be dismissed. The explanatory memorandum to the bill points out that the bill amends the act to protect emergency management volunteers from unlawful dismissal in certain circumstances. It says that the reasons, set out in the relevant subsection at the moment, include temporary absences from work due to illness or injury, race, colour, sexual preference et cetera-which members would be familiar with. The bill proposes to include a new ground to make it unlawful to dismiss an emergency management volunteer who is temporarily absent from the workplace on voluntary emergency management duty. To attract this protection, the absence must be reasonable in all the circumstances. No-one would have any argument with that in this debate, I am sure. Where it falls short is that it does not preclude other discrimination against that worker. It does not, for example-like the award clause I read before-provide that the service of that employee on emergency volunteer service work be included as service for the purpose of recreation leave, sick leave and long service leave, nor does it prevent a person being discriminated against in their career and in future career paths. I raise this as a very live prospect. I dealt with this matter in respect of armed service personnel. I am aware of people who as reservists have confronted major problems in their civilMAIN COMMITTEE Ian employment, where they have quite openly and plainly been told by their superiors that they will not be promoted in their civilian employment unless they reorder their priorities and stop spending time with the Army Reserve. It is not hard to imagine a similar conversation being had with a member of a rural fire board who is required to undertake regular monthly training so that they can do their task safely, both for themselves and for the community they serve. There is nothing I see in this bill to protect workers from having their promotion threatened as a result of volunteer activity. IfI am wrong on that, I would encourage the minister in his reply to these matters to set out clearly where that protection exists in this bill. Equally, I can see nothing in this bill that would ensure that a person undertaking work as a community volunteer would have that service recognised for the purposes of their recreation leave, sick leave, long service leave or other usual entitlements. That is, to all intents and purposes, it is treated as if it were service in the employ of the company-although, of course, it would be without pay. I would ask government members and the minister’s advisers to look at that issue and I would ask the minister in his reply to explain to the parliament where those protections lie in this bill. If, as I suspect, they do not exist in this bill I encourage the minister to once again play catch-up, to once again take Labor’s suggestion, which I am now offering, and introduce legislation to fix that problem. People who undertake this voluntary service deserve to know not just that they cannot be sacked but that their career prospects are not going to be disadvantaged. It seems to me not unreasonable that if they are undertaking work in a serious emergency where they may be engaged for a few weeks in the year-it is not going to be a common experience, but we know it happens-then they should not find, when their annual leave comes around, that they have been docked time. They should not find, when they subsequently become sick, that their sick leave account has been reduced because they were out trying to protect the community-to protect all of us. I have a close friend who is involved in a rural fire service just outside Brisbane. He is regularly involved in training and in maintenance of equipment. He is very proud of the work he and his colleagues do, and rightly so. He raised with me last year this issue-that they have no protection in their employment and there is no recompense. That is a genuine concern people on the ground have. That point was raised with me in advance of Labor’s private member’s bill in October last year. This is not the parliament acting ahead of the game; this is us responding to a genuine concern that ordinary workers in the community have. I raise a further point, which I appreciate is a much more complex issue: the situation of volunteers who are self-employed people. We recognise the problem of self-employed folk who enlist as reservists in the armed forces, and there is a scheme to provide them with some financial support. I think we as a parliament need to look at providing some recognition of those self-employed people-whether they be farmers, electricians or plumbers-who stop their work for a week to go and fight fires or to help those in flood-ravaged areas of our country. They also deserve some recognition in this. This is, I think, a much more complex issue, and it probably involves some financial commitment that would have to be factored into a global budget position. But I encourage both sides of the parliament to look at that problem, because we in this country undervalue the work of our volunteers. We praise them and laud them after an emergency in which they have performed their work but, I have to say, in between those emergencies they tend to go unnoticed, unrecognised and, sadly, under-resourced. MAIN COMMITTEE In passing this bill, we do not just have an obligation to provide protection for volunteers’ employment; I think this parliament is also being provided with an opportunity to give some serious consideration more broadly to the important role our volunteers play in emergency services. If they were not undertaking those duties as volunteers, the community would have to pay an enormous cost to provide the same level of skill, or it would face disasters of substantially greater proportions that would of themselves bring very high costs. These people provide a valuable service to our community, from one corner of Australia to the other. This bill is right to provide employees in that situation with protection from losing their jobs. On my reading of it, it fails dismally in providing the further protections I think it needs to provide to ensure that their other conditions of employment are not also jeopardised. I await the minister’s response in reply to that, and I look forward to an opportunity to debate further the question of assisting self-employed workers, who I think deserve our recognition. I welcome the government’s belated acceptance of Labor’s private member’s bill of October last year. I am impressed that this time-unlike with the Defence reserves-it has not taken them three years; they have managed to come around and understand the importance of this within 12 months. But I would urge the government to revisit the fundamental cause of this-the reason we have this bill at all-which is that the government have stripped from the industrial umpire the power to make these decisions and have taken away from workers the sorts of entitlements they previously had in industrial awards. That is where the remedy should be. This parliament should be changing the industrial relations legislation in this country to put that fairness back into the system. Only when that is done will we have properly resolved this issue and allowed the people at the workface-the employers and the employees in individual enterprises, with the approval of the industrial umpire-to put in appropriate provisions, rather than going through this circus of legislation after legislation, delayed as it is, to try and fix these on a one-off basis. volunteers by speaking for the Workplace Relations Amendment (Protection for Emergency Management Volunteers) Bill 2003. In seeking to amend the Workplace Relations Act the government is recognising the invaluable contribution made to our community by emergency service volunteers. The sheer amount of time and effort contributed by these people could not possibly be made up by regular emergency service organisation employees alone. To put it simply, we could not do without volunteers. It is therefore highly important that some measures be taken in order to protect our emergency service volunteers from dismissal as a result of absence from work while serving our community. In order to better illustrate the impact volunteers in general have on our community, I would like to relate to the House the contributions and achievements of some of my own constituents in the seat of Barker. Several of them have made great contributions to various emergency services in South Australia, but the worth of volunteers in general to our society is what I would like to emphasise the most. I recently held the Barker community awards in my electorate to provide some small recognition to volunteers who make our community what it is. There were four outstanding volunteers to whom I had the pleasure and honour of presenting community award certificates; they are just the kinds of volunteers that this legislation intends to assist. MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Workplace Relations Amendment Protection For Emergency Management Volunteers Bill 2003
294,Mr Secker (Barker) (10.19 A.m.),"I rise to give my support to emergency managementMr Craig Harris, for example, has spent the last 34 years as a Country Fire Service volunteer, firstly with the Willunga brigade, then with the Morphett Vale brigade and now with the Yankalilla brigade. During that time he was one of a select few volunteers to be trained as a fire investigator. He is also a former captain of Yankalilla brigade, a particularly important role given that it is a joint Country Fire Service and State Emergency Service brigade, as many are in South Australia’s rural areas. He currently serves on the regional AIMS team and is one of only a small number of volunteer breathing apparatus instructors. A colleague of Mr Harris told me that he has completed every course the CFS has to offer and has trained and guided many younger members in his many roles. I was also told that Mr Harris has ‘given unselfishly to the community and has risked his life for the ideal that the CFS stands forprotecting and serving the community’. Mr Harris’s contribution is typical of that made by the people this bill seeks to protect. We are fortunate to have such a dedicated emergency management volunteer in our community. Similarly, Mr Graham Lander has been a tireless worker for the Normanville Surf Life Saving Club. During the first two years of the club’s existence, 1998-99-which coincided with my entry into this parliamentMr Lander, as building manager, negotiated with the Yankalilla Council for a clubroom site and liaised with a number of environmental groups, Surf Lifesaving South Australia, designers, engineers, planners and so on. Furthermore he led a fundraising effort at a local level, also gaining the support of the council and the Emergency Services Fund. He continued in this role for the next two years and also assumed the mantle of club president. During the actual construction of the clubrooms in 2001 it became apparent to the club’s management committee that, for various reasons, neither cost nor completion targets would be met. To make matters worse, the possibility of contractual and legal disputes threatened the very existence of the club. It was at this point that Mr Lander took on yet another role-that of builder. Holding a licence himself, he was able to take the contract. He began to work three to five days a week on site, plus he spent many evenings costing and ordering materials and organising subcontractors. This vital work continued for a whole year, during which time Mr Lander continued to run a mixed farm and also established an olive grove and a vineyard. One of his colleagues said that the excellent end result-a fully functioning, licensed and equipped clubroom-would have been extraordinarily difficult to achieve without the foresight, leadership, push and building skills of Graham Lander. Again, we are talking about a person whom this bill seeks to protect during his service to our community. The commitment made to our community by volunteers such as Mr Lander is something that needs to be supported by measures such as those proposed in this bill. Mr Lindsay Honeyman is, simply put, a bit of an all-rounder when it comes to volunteering. He started out quite young, giving up his school holidays to help his father and uncle on the old horse tram at Victor Harbor. Later, when his wife was seriously ill, he gave up work for eight or nine years to care for her and his mother. During this time, both he and his wife worked tirelessly for the local primary and high schools and the football, netball, tennis and cricket clubs. Mr Honeyman was a founding member of the local youth club and still works for it in many ways, including serving as its representative on the Recreation Centre Management Committee and carrying out maintenance work. Another project Mr Honeyman was involved in was the formation of a committee to reinstate the old steam train in Fisher PlayMAIN COMMITTEE ground at Victor Harbor. Not only did he go out seeking donations for this purpose; he also did much of the actual work on the train himself. Among countless other clubs and organisations, Mr Honeyman continues to support the community with his active involvement in the Ratepayers Association, on behalf of which he liaises with the council; the Women’s and Children’s Hospital and the Red Cross, both of which he regularly sells badges for; the local Zonta Club; Rivercatchment Plants Trees for Life; and the Victor Harbor 2002 celebrations. An acquaintance of Mr Honeyman remarked that he has ‘packed his life with an interest in the well-being of others’. This is indeed the true spirit of volunteers and is what we seek to support and encourage today. I will mention one more outstanding personMrs Helen Midgley, who has provided many years of service to the community, particularly through St John Ambulance. A volunteer ambulance officer with about 28 years service, Mrs Midgley was only the fourth female officer in South Australian ambulances. She was also a training officer with the Brigade Advanced Training Corps for 11 years and was in Operation 4 Minutes Team for three years. In 1988 she qualified as a fully trained air attendant for St John Ambulance Air Wing and the Royal Flying Doctor Service based at Adelaide airport, and she still works for the flying doctors and gives them her unswerving support. After the devoluntarisation of the St John Ambulance service, she was a founding member of the Volunteer Emergency Medical Technician Service, assisting the underprivileged in and around Adelaide city. This service operates seven nights a week and is staffed completely by trained volunteer ambulance drivers. Mrs Midgley’s ongoing efforts were acknowledged in 1999 when, in recognition of 25 years as a fully qualified ambulance officer, she was admitted to the Sovereign Order of St John of Jerusalem, Knights Hospitaller, as a Serving Sister. Mrs Midgley is also the founder and president of the Spider Bite Recovery Support Group, which she established after suffering from a particularly poisonous spider bite in 1999. To date, the group has held two state conferences, has offshoots established in Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia and New Zealand, has 520 bite victims registered worldwide and is growing at the rate of four every week. She has written one book, is currently writing a second and has put five years of research into an information pack to assist new victims in the recovery process. She also continues to lobby for funding to continue research in the field of necrotic disease, a particularly shocking condition. As a colleague said of Mrs Midgley, ‘she has given so much to South Australia as a volunteer’, and that is what this legislation is all about-protecting those volunteers. With the efforts of such people as these in mind, it becomes very clear why we need to safeguard the employment of these contributors so as not to discourage them and others like them from volunteering in our society. Volunteers, those who selflessly give their time and effort for the well-being of others, are those that this bill seeks to protect. We rely on them relentlessly, often without even knowing it. For example, in the horror fires earlier this year, we depended on so many volunteer CFS crews to fight the fires and to restore order to these devastated areas. We have relied on SES crews to secure our properties after the great storms that have hit various parts of the country, and we have relied on various volunteer medical teams to provide medical assistance in times of need also. We dial 000 knowing that within minutes someone will respond to our call but never sparing a thought for what this means to them. Naturally, when a 000 call is made, the circumMAIN COMMITTEE stances do not lend themselves to thinking about what the volunteer must do to respond to our call, but in times of calm it pays to reflect upon what it means to drop everything and go to the aid of others. For example, what does it mean to inform your boss that you have to leave work because there is a fire? What does it mean to not be able to advise your boss when you will return? What does it mean to put all your faith in the relationship you have with your employer to maintain your job for you, knowing that at any point you may get a call that means you must leave work regardless of what deadlines need to be met? While most employers fully understand the need to have people who are willing to drop everything to help others, there are some who only see their bottom line, and it is for this reason that the federal government has taken this step to safeguard the employment of these men and women who selflessly make the effort, give up their time and often put themselves in danger to assist others. Section 170CK of the Workplace Relations Act provides certain specified reasons for which an employee’s employment may not be terminated. These include temporary absence from work due to illness or injury, as well as race, colour, sex, marital status, religion, political opinion and so on. This bill will include another reason preventing termination of employment-that is, if the employee is an emergency management volunteer who is temporarily absent from the workplace on voluntary emergency management duty. Reasons for the introduction of this particular bill are several. Firstly, while there is some legislative protection in some states and territories, it is not universal and the scope and limits often differ. Secondly, it will be inserted into the act by way of a statement. This bill will assist in giving effect to the International Labour Organisation’s recommendation No. 166, which states, among other things, that temporary absence from work due to civic obligation should not be a valid reason for dismissal. Lastly, this bill will be, in both a symbolic and practical manner, a statement recognising the much valued efforts and ongoing commitment of emergency management volunteers in Australian society. In short, this bill seeks to formalise across the nation the rules and regulations as to how employers must handle the employment of emergency management volunteers and provides regulations as to how emergency management volunteers must handle their employment commitments in conjunction with their volunteer commitments. The bill will go a long way to providing some protection to employers of emergency management volunteers. Obviously, an emergency volunteer will not automatically gain the protection that this bill will provide unless they are a member of, or have a member-like association with, a recognised emergency management body. Furthermore, an employee’s absence from their workplace must be reasonable given the situation. In order to ensure that volunteers who just turn up to emergency activities do not attract this protection, the bill will limit its provision to the situation where: (a) an employee is requested by, or on behalf of, a recognised emergency management body to carry out an activity; or (b) if no such request was made, it would have been reasonable to expect that such a request would have been made. Simply put, a recognised emergency management service must request the volunteer’s assistance or, if a volunteer reasonably expects that such a request would have been made of them, they may attend on their own initiative and still be protected. Volunteers need that protection because, in many cases, the call will not get to them and they will realise there is an emergency situation and they need to go. MAIN COMMITTEE With regard to the organisations themselves, there are rather a large number that could be classed as emergency management bodies. The scope of the bill includes them all by classing them as one of the following: firstly, bodies that have a role or function under a Commonwealth, state or territory designed disaster plan; secondly, firefighting, civil defence or rescue bodies; and, thirdly, any other body of which a substantial purpose involves securing the safety of persons or animals, protecting property or otherwise responding to an emergency or a natural disaster. The limiting of protection will serve to minimise disruption to employers’ businesses. Indeed, many employers are quite accommodating of volunteers among their employees. Many employers are volunteers themselves. The government is aware that many businesses already have programs in place to provide leave for their volunteers on emergency duty. They are to be commended for this policy. Similarly, this bill will provide a legislative assurance to all volunteers that their jobs will not be jeopardised as a result of their absence from work. Nevertheless, an employee should make every effort to obtain employer permission for their absence where possible and should restrict the duration of their absence to a minimum given the circumstances. It would certainly not be reasonable for an employee to leave their workplace, particularly a small business, for longer than their employer could manage. Our community in this country thrives because so many of our residents give selflessly to others. We thrive because we know that when disaster strikes there will be a vast support network there for us, and we thrive because there is a support network provided to those who support us. The government have decided that it is time to formalise the support for those who support us and to formalise regulations which protect emergency management volunteers. We plan to safeguard their employment so that once they have finished helping others there will still be a job to go back to. We can finally provide them with some kind of relief. They will know that their interests and stability are being looked after, even though they are too busy looking out for others to worry too much about themselves. We can also provide employers with some kind of stability so that they know that, even though their employee is not at work, that employee will not be able to be absent indefinitely or to fraudulently take time off work and claim the protection. This bill seeks to offer dual protection to all of those affected by the need for our volunteers to answer the call to duty when it arises. It is a responsible bill which provides much needed assurances to many sections of our community. Just by having these formalised assurances, many employers of emergency management volunteers and many more emergency management volunteers will feel a sense of security and certainty in going about their duties. The work of our emergency management volunteers and the impact they have on our community are so important. Considering that these people receive no payment for their services and are often out of pocket for associated expenses themselves, considering that they often forgo paid leave to answer requests for assistance and may sometimes even risk their own lives, it seems only fitting that they at least have the assurance of a job when they return to work, and the least we can do is say, ‘Thank you for your efforts.’ In the short remaining time that I have to speak, I note that the previous speaker, the member for Brisbane, put great emphasis on the Industrial Relations Commission as an industrial umpire. Certainly we could take him more seriously if his union mates accepted the umpire’s decision on all occasions. We could take him more seriously if he accepted the umpire’s deciMAIN COMMITTEE sion himself instead of supporting his union mates when they flout and ignore the umpire’s decision. We could take him more seriously if he supported our legislation to strengthen the industrial umpire. But he does not, his union mates do not and the Labor Party do not, so we do not take him seriously, we do not take his union mates seriously and we do not take the Labor Party seriously. They have no policies, no leadership and no unity, and that is the Labor Party for you. I consider this a very useful bill, and I commend it to the House. Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (10.38 a.m.)-It is a pleasure to rise and speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Protection for Emergency Management Volunteers) Bill 2003 and in support of the amendment to be moved by the member for Barton. I believe that this government bill was prompted by Labor’s initiative: the private member’s bill known as the Workplace Relations Amendment (Emergency Services) Bill 2002, which was introduced into the House by the Leader of the Opposition on 21 October 2002. Indeed, when he introduced the bill, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations acknowledged the fact that the impetus for this legislation had come as a result of calls for changes in this area by the Labor opposition, prompted by similar calls from his own backbench, so I am pleased to see the bill here. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.40 a.m. to 10.59 a.m. opposition’s private member’s bill that dealt with similar issues. I very much supported that bill and its intention, which was to give across-the-board employment protection to emergency service volunteers. One of my concerns about this legislation, and I will come back to it, is that I do not believe it is as broad in its scope or as comprehensive in the protection that it offers to emergency services volunteers. The Labor private member’s bill received wide community support and I have to say that even this legislation, in its watered-down form, has similarly received widespread community support. This is particularly so in my outer metropolitan electorate of Hasluck. A substantial part of the electorate is dependent upon the volunteer bushfire brigade for fire control, unlike the rest of the metropolitan area, which is catered for by the Fire and Emergency Services-which is, of course, a professional full-time firefighting service. So we are very dependent on the volunteer bushfire brigade-the Kalamunda Volunteer Bushfire Brigade in particular. That brigade has a very proud history of service to the local hills community in my electorate, and it has been a great pleasure for me to have had dealings with that organisation and to have been able to represent its interests on many occasions. It is completely dependent on its very dedicated volunteers, who give many hours of their time for its operation. The hills area in Perth is considered to be one of the greatest areas of fire risk. The Kalamunda Volunteer Bushfire Brigade spends many hours trying to provide protection to that hills community. The brigade is also something of a family affair-many people involved can say that their parents and their grandparents also served in the local bushfire brigade. It receives financial support from the Kalamunda Shire, and I think it is appropriate on this occasion to acknowledge the shire for that contribution and support. The brigade also relies on donations from business and fundraising for all its equipment and gear. As I said, organisations like the Kalamunda Volunteer Bushfire Brigade rely on their volunteers and certainly welcome any measMAIN COMMITTEE",166,Workplace Relations Amendment Protection For Emergency Management Volunteers Bill 2003
295,Ms Jackson,"Just before we adjourned for the division, I was talking about the Laborures that give their volunteers and, frankly, potential volunteers confidence that their employment will be protected. I had a lengthy discussion with Mr Sean Winter, who is the Captain of the Kalamunda Volunteer Bushfire Brigade, regarding the Labor opposition’s private member’s bill in this areaand also the government’s legislation. He explained to me that they were having an increasing struggle to get volunteers who could be available for the bushfire service from nine to five, Monday to Friday, and that was entirely because of the work commitments of many people in the area. Unfortunately, of course, we cannot dictate precisely when fires will be nor tell them not to burn between nine and five, Monday to Friday. The volunteer bushfire brigade has very good practices in place to alert employers when volunteers are needed to attend fires, and after such fire-fighting services, of course, it always provides a letter to the employer confirming that there has been a fire and that that was the reason for volunteers having absented themselves from work. I think that also has the benefit of ensuring that the service itself cannot be exploited by people who might like to leave their employment without proper cause. Sean Winter explained to me that he joined the fire service some 13 years ago and used to fight fires with the blessing of his employer, as did many other volunteers. He explained to me that they have noted in recent years that that kind of community spirit approach to volunteers leaving the workplace is sadly declining. That may be because, in days gone by, more volunteers were employed closer to home and, since the fire is usually in the local community, the employer, as part of that community, was happy to see the volunteer attend the fire. In my outer metropolitan seat of Hasluck, that is increasingly less often the case. We are, for the first time, experiencing difficulties in attracting volunteers and in their being able to access time off from work. I suspect this is being felt more in my outer metropolitan electorate than in some country areas where the majority of employment is still local. SoI am very pleased to see this legislation introduced to at least provide some protection to volunteers. Not only are we blessed with the Kalamunda Volunteer Bushfire Brigade; I also have a very active state emergency service unit in my electorate, and I want to take this opportunity to commend, in particular, the SES Gosnells unit. The SES Gosnells unit is a delightful organisation. It has provided many years of service to the community. It not only plays a role in the education of the community in local emergency preparedness; it is also part and parcel of any search and rescue operations, both for missing persons and for forensic evidence, and of course it assists members of the community in mitigating the effects of storms. Again, in the outer metropolitan area in the hills of Perth, where we are surrounded by lovely trees and forests, sometimes the effects of storms can have quite devastating consequences, so the Gosnells unit has played a very valuable role in that regard. The unit also supports all other emergency services and agencies in the area. The SES Gosnells unit put in thousands of hours of community service each year, and it is through that constant commitment and the support of the volunteers that the unit is able to continue to provide such a valuable service to the community. Members of the unit make similar comments to that of Sean Winter concerning their ability to continue to attract volunteers, and when I spoke to them of this legislation they also welcomed its introduction. However, as I said at the outset of my comments, the bill fails to provide for what I think is a very important aspect; that is, it does not provide for the reinstatement of leave for volunteers to be an allowable award matter. In other words, the government is continuing to deny MAIN COMMITTEE the Australian Industrial Relations Commission-the umpire-the power to create an entitlement to leave, either paid or unpaid, for volunteers who work in emergency services organisations. It does not provide for that to become an award right. That is a great irony to me because, in the state industrial relations system, such powers exist for the commission and, indeed, in Western Australia we have a number of public sector awards and agreements which, by that award regulation, provide a certain number of days each year for volunteers for emergency services. I think that the ability to have similar provision in the private sector, either by award or agreement, would be warmly welcomed. I say that particularly in light of the concerns that have been expressed to me and by me about the difficulty we are now experiencing in attracting and retaining volunteers. In that regard, the government has taken only a small step to protect emergency services volunteers. I urge the minister, in considering his response to the speeches that have been made in respect of this piece of legislation, to give further consideration to reinstating the power for leave, be it paid or unpaid, for volunteers for emergency services organisations to be reinstated as an allowable award matter in the federal jurisdiction. That would provide the opportunity for the commission to act in that regard. I urge support for the amendment to be put forward by the member for Barton to strengthen the protection and allow the Industrial Relations Commission the right to create award rights for volunteers. That is the greatest deficiency in the legislation that is currently before the parliament. All the bill does is provide some protection against a person being dismissed for attending an emergency. What it does not do is create additional rights, or an opportunity, for people to claim leave, be it paid or unpaid, in order to be a participant in an emergency services organisation. As I have said, this is a critical issue in my electorate. I adopt and support the comments made by the member for Brisbane in his contribution to the debate that this is an area that ought to be considered and that needs to be given some urgent attention by the government. Indeed, if we do not start to take steps in this regard, I think we will be faced in my local hills community with fewer people volunteering to make themselves available to valuable services such as the Kalamunda Volunteer Bushfire Brigade and the Gosnells State Emergency Service organisation. Finally, there are lots of organisations that I did not specifically refer to in my comments that provide a magnificent service to the community. The St John Ambulance Association is one. I take this opportunity to commend all of those who volunteer and to thank them for their contribution. They are valued by many of us. Again, I reiterate my comments in support of the bill and, in particular, the second reading amendment to be moved by the member for Barton. Emergency Management Volunteers) Bill 2003 is about recognising and protecting people such as Nevyn, Bette and William Jones of the Moorooduc CFA. This family of three all received Centenary medals. I believe, although I cannot confirm, that they may be the only family in Australia of which three family members have received the Centenary Medal. The reason that they and people like them from towns such as Kernot, Baxter, Tooradin, Hastings, Somerville and Tyabb have been recognised and focused on in this bill is that these are ordinary Australians from ordinary towns who give of their time, who place their lives at risk, who make a contribution to the community on an ongoing basis and who have until now been inadequately protected in their place of work from some form of retribution by an employer MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Workplace Relations Amendment Protection For Emergency Management Volunteers Bill 2003
296,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (11.11 A.m.),"The Workplace Relations Amendment (Protection forwho does not value their service in the same way. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Protection for Emergency Management Volunteers) Bill 2003 is ultimately and simply about protecting all of those workers who are absent from their work on legitimate volunteer emergency management duties, whether it is with the CFA, the SES or any other genuine emergency management organisation, and who make an enormous contribution to the fibre of towns like Somerville and Rosebud, Cowes and Kernot. I want to address the Workplace Relations Amendment (Protection for Emergency Management Volunteers) Bill 2003 in quick stages: firstly, the background to the bill; secondly, the importance of the bill; and, thirdly, some of the specific provisions which set out to protect emergency management volunteers. The background is simple. As we noticed during the recent bushfires within both New South Wales and Victoria, volunteer firefighters and emergency management personnel make an exceptional contribution to the protection of lives and property throughout Australia. However, there is no legislation protecting these volunteers who are temporarily absent from their work when they are undertaking such emergency management duties, so they are vulnerable to their emergency management service being used as a pretext for dismissal on some other basis. In fact, many emergency management organisations have a rule that the volunteer’s first duty is to their employer, which in turn requires them to obtain permission from the employer before leaving the workplace to attend an emergency, permission which may not always be given and which may not always be obtainable under the circumstances of an emergency. Against that background, what is the importance of this bill? What it does is simple: it will cover not only the firefighters on the front line but also the volunteers who contribute to the management of emergencies and natural disasters. These volunteers, by the very definition of the word ‘volunteer’, receive no financial reward for their efforts. They forgo paid leave in many cases to undertake these activities, and above all else they put their lives at risk. In that situation, it is critical that we emphasise the important role that employers have to play in supporting volunteer efforts in the country. What this bill will do in particular is ensure that employees do not lose their jobs for being away from work to protect the community-whether due to accident, emergency or fire. It minimises the disruption, as well, to an employer’s business. So, in essence, what the bill will do is apply when a recognised emergency management organisation requests the volunteer to carry out an activity or if, having regard to all of the circumstances, there is a reasonable expectation that the volunteer will or should carry out the activity in his or her capacity as a member of that organisation. Very simply, if there is a crisis and it is an ordinary, reasonable and usual activity of a volunteer to respond-even if they are not called but it is part of their drill and part of their process-then the volunteer will be covered, as they should be covered. In addition, the bill will cover all situations where volunteers are not individually requested to attend an emergency but may hear of an emergency and attend on their own initiative. So it protects volunteers. In addressing the provisions, I want to focus on one key element: subsection 170CK(2)(i), which makes it unlawful for an employer to terminate employment where the employee is temporarily absent from the workplace because they are carrying out a voluntary emergency management activity. In order to obtain this protection, a volunteer must show that the absence is reasonable in all of the circumstances. MAIN COMMITTEE I do not wish to speak at length on this bill. It presents a simple proposition-one that I think all people within this House can agree on-and that is that those who give of their time, who give of their resources and who ultimately place their own health and safety at risk for the good of the community should in no way be subject to any risk that they will be penalised for that activity. They should not just be given freedom from risk; they should be given reward and recognition within our community. That is why I return to people such as Nevyn, Bette and Bill Jones of the Moorooduc CFA. They are the types of people whom this bill sets out to protect, Australians who act voluntarily in communities all around Australia. Whether they are in Lang Lang, Kooweerup, Cowes, San Remo, Somerville, Red Hill or any of the areas which have volunteer CFA organisations, these are the people whom we should be respecting and whom this bill sets out to rightfully and appropriately protect. I am delighted to commend this bill and to give it my full support. for Emergency Management Volunteers) Bill 2003 deals with important business. Those of us who represent country districts know how much of a risk fire is, and we know what an enormous community effort is required in order to deal with that risk. It is worth noting-and I want to say this up front-that the government are essentially responding here to a private member’s bill introduced by the Leader of the Opposition on 21 October last year. It was a bill which contained a lot of the same provisions that we now see in the government’s legislation. It is worth making the point here in this place that the government probably should not have been so bloody-minded about it and probably at that time should have just adopted the bill and the suggestion which the opposition made. It would have been a good thing, but that is not what they did. However, we have the legislation from the government before us today, which deals in large part with those issues that were raised in that original private member’s bill moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I was just talking with my colleague and friend the member for Hasluck about the shared community responsibility for emergency management. She made the good point that in a number of the areas in her constituency, people do not work in the town in which they live. This issue that we are talking about today-people being protected from unfair dismissal from their workplaces as a result of being called to help fight a fire in the community in which they live-is particularly important when you have situations like that. It is not something which tends to exist so much in country districts, as you would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Hawker. In country regions we tend to have more people who live in the area in which they work, so that when there is a fire it is a case of all hands on deck and it is hard for an employer not to see how their own interests are served by having a fire put out-because it is likely that their own family’s well-being is at risk, as well as the well-being of their employees. So it is a slightly different circumstance, and it is important that we recognise that this exists in a growing number of communities as people increasingly find places to work that are away from the places where they live. An enormous amount of work gets done through emergency management volunteering. I am lucky in the electorate I represent to have a number of outstanding people who contribute to making our community safe through their participation in the CFA, the SES and numerous other volunteer agencies that are responsive to emergency situations. I have been-as I am sure you have, Mr Deputy Speaker-to many occasions such as annual presentation nights or MAIN COMMITTEE",173,Workplace Relations Amendment Protection For Emergency Management Volunteers Bill 2003
297,Mr Zahra (Mcmillan) (11.17 A.m.),"The Workplace Relations Amendment (Protectionfundraising efforts in the course of the year, and they continue to impress me as a group of people who have a great notion of serving their community first. These people are as good a reflection as you are ever likely to find of the people who live in their various towns and districts. In my electorate, you get farmers participating, you get people who work in the power stations, you get people who work at Rocklea Spinning Mills, you get people who work in retail at the big supermarkets and you get people who are in other circumstances unemployed; you get a great mix of people involved in these agencies. They reflect our community well, and they serve our community well. What we are doing here is ensuring that those people who are in the paid work force are not disadvantaged by participating in the emergency management task that is so vital to our community. The recent bushfires that we have had have been a very powerful reminder to us all of just how significant the threat from bushfires is in our country. I know you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would be aware, as a Victorian-as would other members, because they would have read about them in the newspapers-of just how significant the bushfires in the Gippsland region were. I was fortunate that in my electorate, in my part of the Gippsland region, we had hardly any bushfires at all. We had a few little outbreaks, but they were very quickly contained by the professional volunteers we have and by the full-time staff of the emergency services. But further east in the federal electorate of Gippsland I know people paid a very high price indeed for the bushfires, which ravaged far east Gippsland in particular, during that time. And what we saw was an incredible community effort. We saw an effort which joined employers and employees; we saw an effort which joined volunteers from right across the Gippsland region and the rest of Victoria. They came to where those bushfires were burning in far east Gippsland and they lent a hand. AndI have to say this: as far as I am aware, we had no instances where an employer did the wrong thing by their work force. No-one in the community who was a volunteer and an employee was then penalised for going to fight a bushfire. We did not have a single person, to my knowledge, in that circumstance. I think that says something very good about our region and about our community, but it also underscores the point I made a little bit earlier that, when you live in country districts, you can see much more clearly the shared responsibility and the shared obligation you have in emergency situations. The truth is that, when you work and live in different areas, that clear link is not so clear. There was a great community effort. A large number of people made a big effort to contain those fires and to protect people’s property and families. During that time, we saw a great example of ‘all hands on deck’. People from right across our region-people who were giving up, in some cases, their own time and using their own petrol and resources-were going down and lending a hand further east because they knew that, if they were ever faced with the same circumstances, the same would be done for them. That represents a great spirit of mateship. While a lot of attention tends to be given to those people who actually go and fight the fires in these crisis situations, we also have to make sure that we do not forget about the people who stay behind. I know the work that people do in fighting bushfires is very attractive, and it is something that people want to be associated with. There is great footage on the television, and great stories emerge from the situations where people are fighting bushfires and putting their lives on the line. However, equally brave are the firefighters who stay behind to protect the communities in which they live. These are the unsung heroes, I think, of firefighting, beMAIN COMMITTEE cause it is pretty hard to stay in your community when there is a fire raging some hundred kilometres away which requires a large number of people to go and deal with it. People know that you are in the CFA or the urban fire brigade or what have you, and they say to you, ‘Did you go down to Omeo to help out with the fire?’ and you say, ‘No.’ I guess that that is not an easy conversation for people to have, because they feel the weight of expectation upon them; they feel that people expect them to have gone and fought those fires. WhatI want to say in this place about those people is that they do their communities an incredibly important service by staying behind and being on stand-by to respond to a fire should one take place in the community in which they live. In the Gippsland region, we were feeling very much on edge, very much at risk and very vulnerable at the height of the bushfire situation in our region. We had outbreaks between Morwell and Traralgon, and we had outbreaks in a section of pine plantation to the south of the Latrobe Regional Hospital, and they threatened a large number of properties. If it had not been for those people in our region who had stayed behind and were able to respond to that circumstance, we might well have had another disaster and we might have been fighting bushfires on a number of fronts, instead of being able to fight the large bushfire in the east whilst containing outbreaks in central and west Gippsland. SoI want to place on record the importance of the work that those people do. We really have in Victoria, I think, an outstanding emergency management volunteer system. We have professional full-time staff who are employed by various emergency management agencies and by the state government and a professional emergency management volunteer structure which involves a number of different agencies, with direct responsibility given to those agencies by local towns and districts right across the state of Victoria. I think it is an excellent model. It has gone through some strains and changes over the course of the last six or seven years when we have seen a large amount of pressure applied to those agencies to respond to threats in a different way and to be involved in giving their volunteers a new range of skills and knowledge to deal with fire situations. I say to those people who have been involved in that task: thank you for keeping the faith; thank you for participating in that process and thank you for continuing to be a part of the CFA and the other emergency management volunteer agencies that have been part of emergency management in Victoria for so long. Those of us on this side of the House who represent country districts understand just how important volunteers are to the emergency management task. We have many of those people in our local ALP branches and in our communities. We know them-they are our friends, they are our neighbours-and we are full of admiration for the work they do. The quality of the people we have in those emergency management volunteer organisations is a powerful expression of just how cohesive a community we live in. We have in our community decent, community minded people who are prepared to put their shoulder to the wheel to protect the lives and resources and assets of people who live not only in their own areas but in other towns and districts. Let me conclude by saying how much we appreciate the work of emergency management volunteers and how serious we are in the Labor Party about protecting the volunteer effort people are making in emergency management. Whilst we think that the government should have acted sooner to provide protection for emergency management volunteers, we nonetheless will be supporting this legislation for the protection that it gives to people who could be MAIN COMMITTEE vulnerable to situations where their employer might take sanctions against them simply for carrying out the task of protecting the community in which they live. place Relations Amendment (Protection for Emergency Management Volunteers) Bill 2003, as it will provide direct benefits to those in my electorate who give so much of their time and, indeed, who put their lives on the line for fellow Australians. There is that great Australian spirit of mateship and stepping up to the mark when needed. Whenever the call goes out, our volunteer communities step straight up-no questionslooking for the job, looking out for where they need to participate, doing what has to be done to save people’s lives and property. That is the true spirit of Australia. I suppose that spirit was formed right back before the days of ANZAC and those horrific days in Gallipoli. That Australian spirit of mateship and the desire to help each other has been there since time immemorial in Australia’s history. The most important thing about this spirit of Australia is that it is done without any need for recognition. We do not see our volunteer communities-firefighters, coastguards, people from the state emergency services or other volunteer rescue associations-out there looking for credit or honour, for medals or certificates. They do it because they want to do it. They do it because they know it is the right thing to do for their fellow Australians. I am glad to see that this bill will make it unlawful to dismiss an employee who is temporarily absent from work on voluntary emergency management duty. Currently there is no federal legislation protecting those volunteers who are temporarily absent from work undertaking these emergency duties. Indeed, after the bushfires at Christmas last year I had a visit from a young chap asking for help. He had been away for a couple of weeks fighting fires and had come back to find that his job was no longer there. I can understand the concerns of the small business operator-whose name I will leave out of this-who said that his business had suffered financially because he employed only one person, and this young chap was the person he had employed and he could not financially afford to support him. But this young chap had put his own life on the line and, indeed, extended himself in the protection of others outside the area in which he had lived. He had gone down to the South Coast, to the Jervis Bay region, to fight fires in another region. His own home was not under threat, his own family were not under threat, but to him all that was important was other Australians and their property, which was at risk. It is a pleasure to be speaking to this bill and to see this bill being put through the parliament. This bill will provide the legislative recognition that emergency volunteers deserve for their outstanding service in the protection of the Australian community. It will cover those involved in state emergency services, volunteer rescue associations, rural fire services, coastguards, coastal patrol and, in fact, any recognised volunteer organisation responding to matters of emergency affecting our community. I reflect on the time, not so long ago, when volunteer firefighters from Paterson gave their time to help communities during the 2001 Christmas bushfires. They were some of the most ferocious fires in Australia’s history. They began on Christmas Day and finished around 16 January. When you drive along the Pacific Highway in my electorate, you can see the most damaged areas and how regrowth has appeared in the bush. In local areas there were fires at Swan Bay, Fullerton Cove, Booral, Stroud, Gloucester and Nabiac. But volunteer firefighters MAIN COMMITTEE",175,Workplace Relations Amendment Protection For Emergency Management Volunteers Bill 2003
298,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (11.32 A.m.),"It is a great pleasure to be speaking on the Workalso travelled further afield-to the Blue Mountains, Gosford, Penrith, Sydney and the Hawkesbury area. There was an estimated $100 million worth of damage in New South Wales from those fires, and that figure would have been significantly higher if not for the efforts of our firefighters. One firefighter from Paterson, Albert Kinman, came very close to death during these fires when he was volunteering his time down at Warragamba. He was working with five other firefighters at the time. Their vehicle went up in flames, taking all their belongings with it. Fortunately, no-one was injured in that particular incident but it shows how close to danger our volunteer firefighters actually came. More than 185 firefighters from Great Lakes Fire Control volunteered their time to fight fires, with some people travelling out to Parkes to help with efforts there. I congratulate Fire Control Officer Ian Lewis and the firefighters in the Great Lakes area for their efforts. More than 80 volunteer firefighters from Dungog Fire Control Centre were involved in helping to fight the fires. I thank Fire Control Officer Allan Gillespie and his team for their efforts. The Port Stephens Fire Control Centre had around 130 firefighters working that Christmas, and I congratulate Fire Control Officer Mark Lewis and his volunteers. Maitland Fire Control Centre had around 70 volunteers working on the fires, and I extend my thanks to Fire Control Officer Barry Pont and his team. Shortly after those fires, some 18 months ago, the Prime Minister moved a motion in the parliament recognising the efforts of those fine young men and women. In a further mark of respect, those firefighters were honoured with a certificate from the Commonwealth for their courageous efforts in serving our communities. These men and women perform an outstanding service for the community, and that is why I fully support the legislation before us today. However, if it were not for the support of employers in Paterson, the volunteer firefighters whom I have just mentioned would not have been able to perform their duties. When I travelled around my electorate of Paterson to present the certificates, a number of firefighters made the point of thanking their employers for their support. They appreciated the fact that their employers saw the good that these firefighters were doing for their community and allowed them time to carry out their volunteer duties. Today, the Commonwealth is adding weight to that support by adding to the list of prohibited reasons for terminating a person’s employment with the new category of temporary absence from work for carrying out voluntary emergency management duty. At this point, I should point out that, not long after the election in 2001, in November, the Port Stephens area was affected by tremendous windstorms and hail damage. True to form, the local SES volunteers were out there within minutes removing dangerous trees which were resting on houses, making sure that roofs were tarped down and doing what they had to do to make sure that people’s property was protected from further damage and that people felt secure in their environment. I also recognise the efforts that were undertaken at the Salamander Christian Outreach Centre church building, where an emergency centre was set up to provide accommodation, meals, support and coordination. I thank those people and their leader, Alan Williams, who does a tremendous volunteer job as the head of the SES organisation. Having said that, there is one thing to note: any absence from employment would need to be reasonable in the circumstances in order to be covered by this protection. We need to see MAIN COMMITTEE give and take from both the employer and the employee, remembering that these people contribute to their community but, at times, there is an incredible cost to the employer as well. So, in order for a volunteer to be covered by this protection, the absence needs to stand the reasonable test, having regard to all of the circumstances. In most circumstances there will be an expectation that the employee would seek the employer’s consent before leaving their workplace but, as always, there may be circumstances where this is not possible. During their time away from work, it must at all times be reasonable. For example, as I said before-in the example where one young chap was laid off-for the sole employee of a small business to be away for several weeks fighting fires may not be reasonable because it may place the financial viability of that business in jeopardy and, therefore, have some very serious ramifications. The protection applies to volunteer members of a recognised emergency management body who are requested or expected to attend an emergency matter. Legislation is usually not acceptable unless there has been broad community consultation. I am glad that the officers in the department consulted with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and, indeed, Emergency Management Australia, through the Attorney-General’s portfolio, to discuss and develop guidelines for this legislation. Section 170C of the act will be amended to include reasons for which employers may not dismiss employees under the lines of this volunteer service. It will add to other reasons for which people cannot be dismissed, such as race, sex or temporary absence of work because of illness or injury. Dismissal on these grounds is unlawful, unless it is based on the inherent requirements of a particular job. The act also provides a clear statement that these are not normally accepted reasons for dismissal. So inclusion of voluntary emergency management duty under this provision will recognise the importance of the service that the volunteers provide in protecting our communities in times of disaster. Finally, I am glad to say that this amendment to the Workplace Relations Act is a public statement of support for the efforts of our emergency volunteers. They are highly valued, they are respected by our community, and we need to do what we can to encourage people to participate and become volunteers through our rural fire services, state emergency services, volunteer rescue associations and coastguards. Indeed, anything that we can do in this House that encourages people to be involved in supporting and protecting their community is to be commended. I commend this bill to the House. (Protection for Emergency Management Volunteers) Bill 2003 will be supported by the opposition, although we do consider that it does not go far enough in protecting our volunteer firefighters in their employment. I think it is fair to say that the government has been dragged to the table on this piece of legislation. I remind the House that in October 2002 the Leader of the Opposition put before the House a private member’s bill that enshrined a range of protections for our volunteers in this area of emergency service activity. At that particular time, the government opposed the bill because it claimed it was unnecessary. We have experienced the worse bushfire season on record, where literally thousands of our volunteers were called into service. An unfortunate incident where one volunteer firefighter lost his employment has basically prompted the response of the government today. MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Workplace Relations Amendment Protection For Emergency Management Volunteers Bill 2003
299,Mr Gavan O’connor (Corio) (11.43 A.m.),"The Workplace Relations AmendmentWe certainly do support the central element of this bill, but we do not believe it goes far enough. The bill that Labor proposed sought to restore the power of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to grant paid emergency services leave as part of an award. Our bill attempted to protect volunteers from any form of discrimination as a result of their volunteer service. We felt that those particular provisions were worthwhile and worthy of consideration by the government, but what we have here is just one element of the three elements of Labor’s proposal that was tabled before the House in October 2002. This bill will add to the list of reasons termination of employment by an employer is rendered unlawful by the Workplace Relations Act 1996. The current list of reasons termination is unlawful includes temporary absence due to illness or injury; union membership and legitimate union activities; nonmembership of a union; the filing of a complaint against one’s employer; race, sex or disability; and refusal to negotiate or sign an AWA. Of course, we have now added to that list by virtue of this piece of legislation. Prior to the enactment of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission was empowered to make federal awards dealing with volunteer emergency leave. It was the government that basically curtailed those provisions, and section 89A of the Workplace Relations Act now provides that awards may only include certain allowable award matters, which include annual leave and leave loadings, long service leave and personal or carer’s leave, including sick leave, family leave, bereavement leave, compassionate leave, cultural leave and other like forms of leave. Volunteer emergency leave was no longer an allowable award matter. The bill that we sought to introduce and have passed in the parliament would have restored volunteer emergency leave as an allowable award matter. Of course, it is a matter now on the public record that the government saw fit at the time to oppose a piece of legislation that would have given broad and comprehensive support to volunteers and in particular to our volunteer firefighters. It is now on the public record that a key element of the legislation that was introduced by Labor has now been picked by the government in this bill. We made several attempts to bring that legislation before the House and have it passed. They were opposed by the government, but we are pleased that the government has finally come to its senses and is supporting at least one element of the bill that Labor introduced in October 2002. My interest in these particular matters is on two levels. The first is the fact that I am shadow minister for regional services, and the whole area of budgetary allocations for bushfire purposes comes under my portfolio responsibility. I also have a personal interest in the support that we give to our volunteers, because, as members of this House will recall, the Geelong community lost several of its volunteer firefighters in the Linton tragedy several years ago. I will most certainly add my voice in support of any measure that is brought before this House that gives real support to our volunteer firefighters. That event was a tragedy for the Geelong community. Indeed, it was a tragedy for the volunteer firefighting community in the state of Victoria. It had an enormous impact on our community. I would say that only now, many years later, the effects of that tragedy have washed through the community. For the families concerned, obviously that memory will never go away, but they can be comforted by the fact that this parliament is at least taking some measures-not enough, in my judgmentthat acknowledge the contribution of volunteer firefighters to our firefighting effort. MAIN COMMITTEE Australia has recently gone through a bushfire season which has been acknowledged as one of the worse on record. A combination of climate change factors and the drought made our forests virtual tinderboxes, and it did not take much to spark the disasters that we observed over the last summer. It was not only last summer that we faced this situation. Going back to the season before last, there were some very serious bushfires that threatened life and property in many communities throughout Australia. In this recent bushfire season, Geelong volunteers stepped in, as they always have, to assist other communities in danger. Over 400 firefighters served over the course of the season in various capacities both within Victoria and interstate. I would like to place on the public record the appreciation of the Geelong community and, indeed, of the national parliament for the efforts of those volunteers in my electorate who gave of their time and who in some situations put themselves in some personal danger for the benefit of their fellow Australians. Members in this debate have acknowledged the important role that employers have played in supporting our volunteer firefighters. I endorse the remarks made in his contribution by the member for Paterson, who preceded me in this debate. He made two very important points, which I support. He said that it is very important in this whole area of volunteer effort that every volunteer keeps in mind their position in their enterprise and the fact that, if they do go away on voluntary service to another community, it does place pressure on that enterprise and on other employees. The test in all of these situations is one of reasonableness, and it is one that I would certainly endorse. Having said that, most employers are very pleased with the involvement of their employees in their local communities and with the fact that they do make a contribution beyond their local communities in their chosen field of volunteer activity, and they are, of course, pleased to support them in that. And they do it without getting the acknowledgement from the community that I think they deserve. So here in this debate I would like to acknowledge the contribution that has been made by Geelong employers to the firefighting effort in the state of Victoria and indeed around Australia through their support for those of their employees who happen to be volunteer firefighters and were in the last season engaged in firefighting activities. I would also like to especially mention the support given by families and friends to volunteer firefighters. The member for McMillan made the point that these are ordinary people in our community who have a deep sense of duty to their communities and to this nation. They go about their daily business and they volunteer their time and effort, without getting acknowledgement for it, and they are happy to do it. It is that true spirit that we have identified in a bipartisan way in this debate that really makes this community of Australians very strong. It is a sentiment that is echoed around the world. I was recently in Canada, where the provinces face similar situations to those that we face here and there is a similar situation, with communities coming together to fight fires. I have been hearing on the news of the current bushfires that are occurring in the United States and the efforts of communities to contain those fires. The spirit that we claim as our own is really a universal one. It is one we should be encouraging at every level of our community. Sad to say, I think that spirit is a little on the wane. The pressures we are imposing in our society-and the government must accept some responsibility for this-have meant that in our workplaces the task of earning a living has become very tough. Many people simply do not have the time available that they had in the past to devote to these community based acMAIN COMMITTEE tivities. Families and households are under stress from policies that have been introduced by this government. SoI say to members opposite that it is all very well to get up in this debate and acknowledge the contribution of volunteers, families and employers-we join you in that acknowledgement-but we ask you to have a look at the policies that you have introduced. Indeed, this particular bill is one example of where the government has put inordinate pressures on families and households and, as a consequence, many people are not able to participate in a voluntary capacity to the extent that they would like. But I think there is another cultural danger emerging for Australians. It is emerging among many of our young people, who have a self-centred approach to their futures and to their communities. I know the natural tendency of youth is to look to their immediate future, and I am not being overcritical here, because in the main young people do contribute quite significantly-and in my community quite heavily-in a whole range of activities of a voluntary nature. You do not go many Sundays in Geelong without seeing young people, from both public and private schools, in their school uniforms collecting for various charities. You also see young people at the traffic lights supporting our surf lifesavers and the CFA in their fundraising activities. So these comments are in no way made to disparage those particular contributions. But I think as a community we need to pay particular attention to nurturing the culture of voluntary service, because that is the real fabric that weaves our communities and brings us together. In conclusion, I hope the measures contained in this bill will be passed. Let me restate our disappointment that perhaps the bill has not gone as far as we would have liked in terms of containing the measures we put before the House in the private member’s bill tabled in October 2002. But the government has at long last acknowledged that this particular provision is necessary. In October 2002, following the tabling of our legislation, the government said these particular measures were unnecessary. Now that we have gone through the experience of the bushfire season and we have seen the contribution that was made by volunteers, at least there is a final acknowledgement of the importance of this particular piece of legislation to volunteers throughout the nation. On this side of the House we are accused by the government of being a policy-free zone, but I think the boot is on the other foot. We have heard from the member for Hunter about the fact that the government has no energy policy. I was in this committee several times during the last session, and I have put before the committee the fact that the government still does not have a tourism policy and, of course, I have put before this committee the fact that the government does not have a national bushfire policy. And it still does not. It is quite extraordinary to see the minister’s press releases coming out on the issue of national bushfire policy, because he has done it all before. Following the 2001-02 bushfire season, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the government would develop a national bushfire strategy with the states and territories, and the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government stated the very same thing in one of his press releases. He commissioned Australia’s top firefighters to prepare a report, and he received it in August 2002. He binned the report, saying that it was simply a wish list of aerial firefighting resources that would be required in the next bushfire season. A very important opportunity was lost. The rest is history. MAIN COMMITTEE While the minister fiddled, Australia burned. It is a source of regret that, in the enormous task that faced our volunteers in the worse bushfire season on record, all we had from the government was a few sexy Elvis helicopters that they brought to the task and a few good photo opportunities for the Prime Minister and the minister concerned. However, the diversity of aerial firefighting resources that our top fire chiefs said was necessary to combat fires in the past season was not provided by the minister. He did not take the advice of his top fire chiefs from the states, and the rest is history. I mention this for one particular reason: when you are out in the bush as a volunteer firefighter and the wind changes and you get that shiver up your spine because you know there is the potential for you to lose your life, the ability to call on an aerial firefighting resource is absolutely critical. I am very disappointed that the government did not take the golden opportunity to do something constructive in this policy area before the last season. I am passionate about this, because some of my volunteer firefighters faced it at Linton, and they were incinerated-burnt to death. So it is a very personal matter that the Geelong community raises in the context of this debate. We warmly receive the one provision that has been made in this legislation. You said it was not necessary; well it is-and so are the two other matters that were raised by the Leader of the Opposition and proposed to the House in October 2002. (Time expired) for Corio, despite a panoply of criticisms, actually does endorse on behalf of the opposition the Workplace Relations Amendment (Protection for Emergency Management Volunteers) Bill 2003. I think it is important that there be that sort of endorsement, and the government is very grateful to have it. The Canberra winter may have dulled our recollection of what an Australian summer looks like, but just a few months ago we saw devastating bushfires-amongst the worse on recordsweep through large tracts of the Australian countryside, many parts of which had already been debilitated and parched by the drought. Amidst the devastation, the Australian tradition of community and comradeship shone through, and the efforts of volunteer firefighters and emergency service personnel were instrumental in limiting damage and saving many rural towns and homes from destruction. Everybody in the parliament appreciates the selfless efforts of our emergency service volunteers, and they do so very substantially. With this in mind, it is important that we address a gap in the Commonwealth government’s legislative net-a gap which might otherwise undermine a priceless contribution. Under current Commonwealth legislation, it is not illegal for an employer to dismiss an employee who is acting as an emergency services volunteer and is absent from their place of work in order to perform an emergency duty. There are many informal social sanctions on an employer who dismisses an employee on the grounds that the employee, in their capacity as a volunteer firefighter, is absent from work in order to fight bushfires that threaten his or her local community. But we cannot rely just on social sanctions to protect emergency volunteers; it is incumbent upon the Commonwealth government to ensure that this protection is in place. The Workplace Relations Act 1996 provides employees with protection from unfair termination. Section 170CK provides that an employer must not terminate an employee for reasons such as a temporary absence from work due to illness or injury. It also provides that an employer cannot terminate an employee on the grounds of race, colour, sex, sexual preference, MAIN COMMITTEE",180,Workplace Relations Amendment Protection For Emergency Management Volunteers Bill 2003
300,Mr Georgiou (Kooyong) (12.03 P.m.),"I warmly welcome the fact that the memberage, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Protection for Emergency Management Volunteers) Bill will insert into section 170CK of the Workplace Relations Act a new clause making it unlawful for an employer to dismiss an emergency services volunteer who is temporarily absent from the workplace for the purposes of emergency management duty. As the minister has noted, this clause reflects the International Labour Organisation’s recommendation 166 on the termination of employment, which provides that an absence from work due to civic obligation should not constitute a valid reason for the termination of employment. It is worthwhile remarking that the minister thought it important to note in his reference to the ILO’s recommendation that it did not ‘represent a wider endorsement of the [ILO’s] recommendation for any other purposes of the Workplace Relations Act’. Leaving this aside, I note that Australians volunteering to assist their community in times of emergency and disaster are without question performing an invaluable civic duty. For the protective measures outlined in this bill to apply, the employee must be carrying out emergency management activities on a voluntary basis. The employee must also be a member of-or in a member-like association with-a recognised emergency management body. The concept of a member-like association is intended to cover circumstances where a recognised emergency management body has no formal membership requirements, or where a person’s membership may have recently lapsed but the person is for all practical purposes still considered to be a member of the emergency organisation. The bill lists the categories of emergency management bodies that will fall within its protection regime. The categories of recognised emergency management bodies are deliberately wide in their scope in order to extend the bill’s protective measures to as many deserving emergency organisations as possible. The categories are: bodies that have a role or function under a Commonwealth, state or territory designated disaster plan; a firefighting, civil defence or rescue body; and any other body with a primary objective of ensuring the safety of persons and animals, and the protection of property in the event of an emergency or a natural disaster. The protective measures outlined in the bill will apply to employees who, as volunteers, are carrying out an activity that directly deals with an emergency or a natural disaster. An emergency’s immediate preparation and post-emergency activities would be covered; however, participation in more regular activities-such as training-would not fall within the scope of the protection provided by this bill. This bill makes it clear that, in carrying out a voluntary emergency activity, the employee must receive a request from or on behalf of an emergency services body. If no request is made, the employee will still fall within the scope of the protective measures outlined in the bill if it can be determined that a request would have been made had circumstances permitted. This provision makes it clear that employees who act as ‘casual volunteers’-that is, those who take it upon themselves to provide unsolicited assistance during an emergency-cannot use the protective measures outlined in this bill as a reason for not appearing at work. This bill complements existing state and territory legislation relating to the employment rights of emergency services volunteers, and it will provide broad coverage of the range of conceivable situations in which emergency volunteers may need to be absent from their place of work. For instance, the protection measures in this bill are not restricted to those situations MAIN COMMITTEE where a formal state of disaster or emergency has been declared. They will apply to any emergency situation where the employee’s absence may be considered reasonable. In developing the measures outlined in this bill, the government has been conscious of the need to minimise disruption to Australian business. This government has a proud record of supporting Australian business of all shapes and sizes. It should be acknowledged that many employers, particularly those with few staff, do face problems if an employee is away for an extended period. It is for this reason that the bill stipulates that the employee’s absence from work must be considered ‘reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances’. This involves the employee, wherever possible, seeking the employer’s consent before absenting himself or herself from the workplace. Obviously, there will be cases of sudden or extreme emergencies where prior consent from the employer is simply not possible, and that is a consideration in determining what is reasonable in the circumstances. The duration of the employee’s absence would have to be considered reasonable, and, of course, it would be only temporary. The size of the employer’s business is another factor that may affect what is considered reasonable. Some employers have greater flexibility in terms of the ability of their business to respond across a long period of time to an emergency situation. The purpose of the bill is to protect the employment status of employees during their periods as emergency service volunteers, not to impose a burden upon employers to provide time off work other than on agreed leave. I note these points to highlight the balance between competing interests and not in any way to suggest that employers oppose their employees volunteering as emergency service personnel-quite the opposite, as previous speakers have noted. It is a very notable attribute of Australian society that we are a nation with a deep commitment to volunteerism and allowing employees to volunteer for emergency bodies, and this is seen by most employers as a facilitation of a vital community service. The bill will provide peace of mind to volunteers without causing undue headaches to employers. Volunteers will know that, when they are willingly putting their lives on the line to protect the people, animals and properties of Australia from disasters and emergencies, their jobs will be protected. I once again welcome the support of the opposition for the bill and I commend the bill to the House. Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (12.12 p.m.)-I rise today, like my colleagues before me, to speak on an issue that is increasingly becoming an important part of hundreds of local communities throughout Australia. Such is the case in my electorate of Calwell. For years our volunteer firefighters have been at the forefront of some of this nation’s worse and most horrific natural disasters, particularly bushfires, but they are at our service in all emergencies, from small-scale to large. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Protection for Emergency Management Volunteers) Bill 2003 presents us with the ability to reward this service and show them that, as a parliament and as a community, we value the provision of their voluntary labour and will do everything we can to protect them and uphold their rights in the workplace. In my electorate of Calwell, as the urban sprawl continues, pockets of suburbia are getting closer to what is essentially bush and scrub land. It is a sprawl encouraged, admittedly, by this government’s First Home Owners Scheme, but it is done without much thought for the growing household debt, the cost to social services or, more importantly, the lack of infrastructure for these new communities. In the case of fire protection and prevention, CFA volunteers play a sizeable part in the defence of farmland, residences, livestock and human lives. Similarly, MAIN COMMITTEE the SES volunteers play an integral role in ensuring that, when disaster does, unfortunately, strike, people are inconvenienced as little as possible and the lives of those affected are quickly restored to some level of normality. In this bill the government finally seeks to protect emergency workers from unlawful dismissal if their absence is reasonable in all circumstances. While it is generally agreed that this risk of dismissal is minimal, and it is felt that most employers take a reasonable approach to their volunteer firefighters, matters can occasionally get out of hand and dismissals can and have occurred. While such matters are often addressed with a simple communication on the part of the emergency services commander, in some cases, as illustrated by the recent sacking of a firefighter in Victoria, this reliance on reasonableness is indeed not infallible. This bill seeks to address the status quo where, under current Commonwealth legislation, it is not illegal to dismiss on these grounds. Furthermore, it seeks to bring the legislation in line with recommendation 166 of the International Labour Organisation, which states that absence from work due to civic obligations is not a valid reason for termination of employment. While the Australian Labor Party welcomes the government’s new found admiration for the ILO recommendations, we suggest that the government should develop an even greater fondness for the spirit and conventions of the International Labour Organisation. It is interesting to note that from the period 1972 onwards, of the 24 conventions ratified by the Commonwealth government, only one convention has occurred during coalition governments. While this government may be awash with the spin and rhetoric of looking out for the battlers, its track record, both in this domain and in a host of others, is suggestive of a very different picture. This is further illustrated by the fact that in October 2002, when the Leader of the Opposition aired the possibility of protecting our volunteers, the response by the government was one of refusal, arguing that such legislation was not in fact necessary. We are relieved that the government has finally decided to address this issue, and we are amused to note that the minister feels that his decision to present this bill was a result of some of the initiatives and statements from members on this side of the House. Labor has a proud tradition of, and is dedicated to, protecting the rights of workers. With this bill the parliament has an opportunity to correct the omission that still exists whereby under Commonwealth law it is, as I have said, not illegal to dismiss on the grounds of absence due to emergency volunteer service. As I have already indicated, while such action is unlikely, the fact that it nevertheless exists is a matter that requires urgent and careful consideration. For decades volunteers from all persuasions of Australian life, all deserving of our admiration and support, have been an integral part of the fabric and, indeed, the survival of this country. This bill presents us with an opportunity to defend the very people who risk life and limb for the rest of the community-whether they are volunteers in my electorate fighting grassfires or the hundreds of volunteers who converged on Canberra in January to help fight that national bushfire disaster-and heroically save life and property across the nation. I know the community values the commitment and sacrifice of volunteer firefighters, because it understands the fundamental role they play in protecting property and life. While we welcome the government’s actions in introducing this bill, we are disappointed to see that it is a diluted version of the private member’s bill introduced by the Leader of the Oppositionwhich has resulted, of course, in this bill before us today. While the minister might like to dwell on his new found instincts and the impulses of government members to protect workers, MAIN COMMITTEE he appreciates that this bill has indeed come forward into the parliament as a result of opposition initiatives and statements. Nevertheless, at the final hurdle, the government has stumbled and once again fallen short of a satisfactory defence for workers. As I said, while we welcome the intention of the bill-which is to prohibit the termination of employment for volunteers as a result of participation in emergency volunteer operations-it is, in its present form, far from being a satisfactory outcome. The bill fails in two key related areas, and it is in these two areas that the opposition is moving amendments to the bill. The first of the areas relates to the overarching threat of victimisation. The amendments moved by the opposition would give the Federal Court the jurisdiction to guard emergency services volunteers against victimisation. Such victimisation can be quite implicit in its nature and can include instances where volunteers, whilst not being threatened with loss of employment, are nevertheless assigned less favourable tasks or shifts or are systematically and constantly overlooked for promotional advancement. It is utterly deplorable that these people are ultimately discriminated against simply because of their solid commitment to community spirit. As a parliament we need to do all we can to prevent that from occurring. While instances of victimisation are rare, state emergency services are unanimous in their welcoming of any additional employment protection. Despite the fact that this is a concept that might be a little unfamiliar to the government, the utmost protection of these employees is of great importance not only to the workers themselves but also to the Australian Labor Party. The second aspect that the government has chosen to ignore in its protection of workers relates to paid leave. The amendment to this bill that the Labor Party will move will restore the power of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to make award provisions granting emergency service volunteers paid leave. While the government may not deem it necessary, it has been well documented that the CFMEU has already lodged a claim with the commission to vary two federal awards, the results being the protection of volunteers’ pay in addition to their employment. This is indicative of a growing trend within a range of industries, one that has seen a host of companies provide paid leave for emergency services. As reported in the Australian on 29 January 2003, Holden, Telstra, Coles Myer and Bendigo Bank already have in place a system ensuring that employees who are absent from work due to volunteer service are not financially disadvantaged. As a parliament, we need to be adamant in our protection of workers, especially when those very same workers go out of their way in order to protect our homes, our properties, our communities and ultimately our lives. I would like to quote former President of the United States Bill Clinton, who I believe has epitomised almost perfectly the whole spirit of volunteering. Bill Clinton said: Volunteering is an act-it’s an act of heroism on a grand scale, and it matters profoundly. It does more than help people beat the odds; it changes the odds. The passage of this bill, together with the amendment, would be a perfect illustration to these volunteers that they have the support and the appreciation of their communities, of their federal parliament in particular and of the nation as a whole. ment (Protection for Emergency Management Volunteers) Bill 2003 is indeed very important, but it is rather a pale imitation of the one that was introduced in October last year by the Leader of the Opposition. Again, this bill follows the opposition in the area of policy. The MAIN COMMITTEE",184,Workplace Relations Amendment Protection For Emergency Management Volunteers Bill 2003
301,Mr Brendan O’connor (Burke) (12.21 P.m.),"The Workplace Relations AmendPrime Minister followed the Leader of the Opposition when he decided to commemorate a day for the Bali victims. The Prime Minister followed the Leader of the Opposition when he started to make doorstop references to maternity leave. The Prime Minister’s references to maternity leave were rather inane, but nonetheless they were subsequent to the Leader of the Opposition’s comprehensive proposal on maternity leave. Again, the government follows the opposition in attending to what is clearly a deficiency in the Workplace Relations Act-more importantly, a deficiency in attending to the needs of the many thousands of volunteers across the country, many of whom reside in my electorate of Burke. As the member for Calwell said, volunteers are the lifeblood of the community-not just volunteers who fight fires but also volunteers who do all sorts of other things in the community. I suppose what we are looking at today are those emergency services requiring people to quite often give up their own time but, on occasions when they might otherwise be gainfully employed, to give up time undertaking the protection of their own community. I think under the auspices of emergency services we should also add the volunteers who come to the aid of communities suffering from either drought or flood, the other excess. There are many volunteers who do that, and I think they should be referred to. This bill is a narrow construction of the Leader of the Opposition’s bill that was introduced last year. It gives only very limited protection to those volunteers who might have to attend an emergency while at work and who might find themselves facing the wrath of an employer. I think these employers would be in the minority, but nonetheless they do have the ability to terminate their services. Firstly, let us examine the very limited capacity of this bill to protect the interests of those volunteers. Clearly, this bill will not allow employers to terminate the services of volunteers who attend to an emergency and who return to work that day or subsequent to that day. I applaud that. I think that is quite correct. It is something that the Labor opposition supports overwhelmingly but, again, it does not go far enough. It is fair to say that we do not expect volunteers to risk their jobs as well as their lives; but it is not fair to say that this bill properly encompasses the needs of volunteers in the workplace, because the needs of volunteers in the workplace go beyond whether they can be terminated. It is important to ensure that volunteers are not adversely affected by contributing to their communities in the way that they have chosen to do in emergency services. It would be quite foolhardy of this nation to allow that. The Prime Minister likes to stand on his soapbox and laud the efforts of volunteers but when it comes to comparing the two bills-the bill to which we refer today and the bill introduced by the opposition in October last year-this bill is inferior in many respects. It is inferior because it fails to give any assurance to volunteers that they will not be adversely affected in terms of promotions or the way in which they may be treated by their employer. Indeed, it does not even provide for their time of absence to be paid for if that was agreed to under a federal award. These deficiencies show yet again that this government are ideologically blind to the needs of volunteers. By that I mean the passion and energy this government put into narrowing the entitlements of employees supersedes their concern for volunteers in this society. That is a disgrace. With respect to this area, which the Prime Minister has made so much mileage out of, you would think he would have come across to the opposition’s view and said, ‘Yes, there should be no ability for an employer to diminish the career capacity of people who have volunteered in emergency services.’ But the Prime Minister has not said that. The government MAIN COMMITTEE have failed to say that. WhilstI support the bill I think it is very narrow in its construction. It pays lip-service to the needs of the many workers who volunteer. I have some personal experience with many hundreds of volunteers. I have the good fortune of representing workers in local authorities and water boards. Historically those authorities have always expected their work force, in times of flood and fire, to attend to local needs. It has been their custom and practice for many years. In Victoria, under the Kennett Liberal government, there were changes to that. All of a sudden those undertakings by local authorities diminished and there was more pressure on them to act as if their duties to the community at large, compared to their day to day activities, were no longer important. I think since the Kennett government lost the 1999 election that is starting to turn around. I would like to cite one live example of what can happen when there is no protection afforded to these volunteers. I was personally involved in a matter that had to do with the Bellarine Bayside foreshore committee, which I believe is in the member for Corio’s electorate but might overlap with the member for Corangamite’s electorate. This foreshore committee’s manager, who was appointed by the then Kennett government, wished to place the employees under duress so that they would sign Australian workplace agreements. And he had some success because he had all the employees in the outdoor work force, except one, signing an Australian workplace agreement. That one worker had a job to cut the lawns around the foreshore and on one amazing day he was on his ride-on mower and he was mowing the lawns. As is his right, he was without an AWA; he was resisting the efforts of the employer to have him sign up to an individual contract. He was on his ride-on mower and his pager went off. He was an officer of the CFA-a lieutenant, if you like, of the CFA in that area-and he was asked to attend to a fire, which he did. He locked up the ride-on mower, phoned his office and left a message with the reception staff to say that he was attending to a fire. He got on the vehicle; in fact, he was the only officer available and that truck could not go out, under the rules of the CFA, without his attendance. He went to the fire-thankfully, it was not a large fire-and he helped put the fire out. He came back to his workplace and finished his mowing-would you believe? The next day he received a letter of termination, and the first reason in that written termination was the fact that he had abandoned his employment by going to a fire without getting permission from his manager. That actually happened in a local government authority in Victoria, only three years ago. As an employer you would have to be a fool, for a start, to think that the community would accept you dismissing that employee, particularly given that he was employed by a local government authority. Indeed, this employer, knowing they could not use the fact that the employee would not sign an AWA, decided instead-thinking, ‘I’ll be cute here’-to sack him on the basis that he abandoned his employment and went to fight a fire down the road. That is what this employer did. As you can imagine, I was very happy to get involved in that matter. Too often dismissals are not very easy matters to deal with, but in that case, representing that employee, we sorted that matter out very quickly to the satisfaction of that employee. The point that has to be made is that there was no protection under the award. Sure, the community got together and there was a lot of public outcry. Whilst the fire was small, it was very close to the Linton tragedy. Indeed, this employee knew a number of those fighters that the member for Corio mentioned who tragically lost their lives in the Linton fire. You would MAIN COMMITTEE have thought in an area that was so sensitive to this issue that there could not be a possibility that a local authority would terminate a worker with the express reason that he abandoned his employment to fight a fire, but that is exactly what happened. This is a very important bill, though very narrowly constructed and therefore not providing the real protection needed for the volunteers across this country. We support the bill. But again it is another example of the government following the opposition in an area that it has failed to attend to because it has no domestic agenda whatsoever. It is another area where it is following the leader-in this case, it is following the Leader of the Opposition in introducing this bill. We support the bill, but it certainly falls far short of attending to those other issues that we have referred to-namely, giving the capacity for people to take paid leave and providing protection to ensure that the workers that might be involved in emergency services in a voluntary capacity are not adversely affected in their career, in their workplace. These failings, I think, highlight not just a deficiency in the government, not just tardiness in the drafting of legislation, but an ideological conflict, an ideological blindness. In the end, they would far prefer volunteers to suffer than actually accept that the Workplace Relations Act may have to be properly broadened to ensure that these fantastic contributors to society are protected at the workplace. place Relations Amendment (Protection for Emergency Management Volunteers) Bill 2003 in the Main Committee. I should indicate that in the Senate we will be moving some amendments which we believe will improve or appropriately broaden the bill. If those amendments fail, we have indicated to the government we will nonetheless support the current bill because it is at least an improvement, albeit a lesser improvement than that proposed in a private member’s bill moved by the Leader of the Opposition. The bill provides our emergency service volunteers with job protection. This is an important measure for several reasons, not the least being that the last thing volunteers engaged in emergency operations should have to contend with is the fear of losing their jobs while fighting a fire, rescuing a drowning child or caring for injured Australians in a disaster situation. Fortunately, most employers support and appreciate the service their employees perform as volunteers in the emergency services area. It is rare for employees to suffer detriment or recrimination as a result of their volunteer services. Nevertheless, there are examples of this, as the member for Burke recounted from his previous experience. Labor believes that job protection for employees who volunteer for emergency services is not solely a question of legal rights and remedies; it is equally important for our laws to recognise the value the community attaches to volunteers. By enshrining job protection for volunteers in Australian law, this parliament will add to the list set out over eight paragraphs in the Workplace Relations Act containing various impermissible reasons for an employer to terminate the employment of an employee. Such reasons now include temporary absence due to illness or injury, various union activities, race, sex, age and the taking of parental leave. The list of banned reasons for the dismissal of an employee is not just a recitation of proscriptions on employer behaviour; it is much more than that. It is a reflection of Australian and international values of what is fair and just in the workplace. Here the law directly expresses community standards and values on what should and should not be allowed in the workplace. By adding service as a volunteer in emergency MAIN COMMITTEE",188,Workplace Relations Amendment Protection For Emergency Management Volunteers Bill 2003
302,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (12.33 P.m.),"The opposition will be supporting the Worksituations to this list, the parliament will be keeping our laws in touch with community standards and expectations. The protection this bill will provide to workers will cover almost all Australian volunteers. This is because the constitutional foundation for this protection will be Australia giving force to its obligations under the International Labour Organisation’s recommendation 166, Termination of Employment Recommendation 1982. ArticleV of the recommendations adds to the list of invalid reasons for dismissal that were set out earlier in the ILO’s Termination of Employment Convention. The recommendation reads, among other things: Civil obligations should not constitute valid reasons for an employer to terminate an employee. By the parliament passing this law, Australia will be further adopting the job protection standards identified by the ILO as having general application, and this course of action is welcomed by Labor. This course of action will also mean there will be some overlap between state and federal laws on job protection for emergency volunteers. Labor takes the view that this overlap will not detract from the operation of state laws and, where state laws give additional protections to that which is provided for in this bill, it is not the intention of this bill to derogate or detract from the operation of those state laws. For example, under the State Emergency and Rescue Management Act 1989, a New South Wales act, volunteers are protected from victimisation in their employment. The current federal bill does not go to that issue. Nonetheless, Labor expects that New South Wales employees covered by the state act will retain such protections in addition to the remedies that will be afforded to them under this bill. In making this comment, I should add that Labor would prefer that this bill go further and provide, as far as is constitutionally possible, protection for all Australian workers from victimisation in employment as a result of their volunteer activities. I should also point out that Labor did introduce into the House prior to this bill a private member’s bill-in fact, it was introduced by the Leader of the Opposition-to highlight the significance of the issue that provided employees with protections against victimisation because of their participation in emergency situations as a volunteer. In addition, Labor’s bill reinstated the Australian Industrial Relations Commission’s powers to include in awards volunteer leave provisions. Labor sought this provision because it had faith in the commission to deal with the leave issue in a balanced way, taking into account the case for employers to pay wages to employees engaged in voluntary activities against other competing arguments, not the least of which is the impetus to keep well-staffed, capable and professional emergency services. Within sight of this parliament earlier this year, Australians were faced with disaster in the form of a savage and calamitous bushfire. The fire caused much grief and loss, but Australians reacted in the way we expect: by helping their neighbours, giving to those who lost their homes and businesses and taking risks to save others. This bill recognises the spirit of aid and comfort that emerges in disaster, and for those reasons we will support the government in respect of this bill. As I have indicated, to expedite the bill’s passage we have agreed to its proceeding through the Main Committee without amendment. We will seek to move amendments in the Senate, it being noted that ultimately we would in any event support the government’s bill, as it is at least a significant improvement on the vacuum that currently exists in protection for volunteer workers. ter Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (12.40 p.m.)-in reply-In summing MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Workplace Relations Amendment Protection For Emergency Management Volunteers Bill 2003
303,Mr Abbott (Warringah,"Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minisup the Workplace Relations Amendment (Protection for Emergency Management Volunteers) Bill 2003, I thank members on both sides of the House who have spoken and who have taken an interest in this topic and urged upon me and the government the necessity for a bill along these lines. As usual, I particularly thank the shadow minister for workplace relations, the member for Barton, for his very thorough and carefully considered contribution. Some members in the course of this debate have raised questions about possible discrimination and possible victimisation of emergency services volunteers. I believe that, in all reasonably conceivable circumstances, those matters are already adequately dealt with in other legislation. But this is an important bill, because it is important for us as a society to indicate to emergency service volunteers that we take them seriously, that we encourage what they do and that we do not want to see them in any way damaged or hurt because of their participation in protecting our community. It is very encouraging that the shadow minister has indicated Labor’s support for the bill notwithstanding the fate of any amendments in the Senate. I think it would be most desirable to have this bill through the parliament well before the coming bushfire season, because we do not want any emergency service volunteers to feel under any unnecessary pressure or to have any unnecessary anxiety as we go into the next summer. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.

Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (Question No. 1648) Mr Ripoll asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 18 March 2003: (1) What strategy does the Government have in place to address issues such as homelessness induced by funding cuts under the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement. (2) How many people are homeless in (a) Australia and (b) each State and Territory. (3) How many people are homeless in each federal electoral division and, in particular, the electoral divisions of Oxley and Blair. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) There are no funding cuts to the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement (CSHA). On 25 October 2002, the Commonwealth offered the States and Territories a new agreement that will provide funding of $4.75 billion over 5 years from July 2003. This is around $210 million more than if the current CSHA was extended, because indexation will be provided for the first time. The key Commonwealth strategies to address homelessness are through the CSHA and Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP). CSHA grant funding enables States and Territories to assist low-income households whose housing needs are not met in the private rental market, in particular people with special needs, that is those with disabilities, lone parents, indigenous and the aged. By targetting these groups, the CSHA works to assist people to avoid homelessness. The CSHA gives priority access to housing for those in greatest need, including homeless people. Specific strategies will be negotiated bilaterally with each State and Territory. As well as the broad objectives, the CSHA has a specific program to target people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless, the Crisis Accommodation Program (CAP). CAP is a capital program that provides short-term housing accommodation to people in crisis. Around $40 million of CSHA funding is committed to the CAP program annually. The CAP program has close links with the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP).",196,Questions On Notice
309,Mr Anthony,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the followSAAP is the main service delivery response to homelessness. SAAP is a cost shared program with States and Territories aimed at providing support services to assist people in crisis who are homeless and those at risk of homelessness to move toward independence. States and Territories administer SAAP on a day-to-day basis. There are currently over 1200 non-government organisations funded to provide crisis support services to homeless people. Under the current SAAP IV Bilateral Agreement, the Commonwealth’s recurrent contribution to SAAP is estimated to be approximately $830 million (2000/01-2004/05). Combined with the States and Territories contribution, the total funding to SAAP will be over $1.4 billion for the same period. (2) (a), (b) There are currently no reliable estimates of the number of homeless people in Australia. The Australian Bureau of Statistics used a special strategy on Census night in 2001 in an attempt to devise an estimate of people who were homeless on that night. It is expected that they will release a paper on that work as part of the 2001 Census papers. I am however able to provide numbers of clients assisted by the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP), which is a key program assisting homeless people. SAAP provided assistance to 95 600 clients in 2001-02 (Table 1).

Family and Community Services: Program Funding (Question No. 1649) Mr Ripoll asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 18 March 2003: Is the Government planning to continue program funding under the Men and Family Relationship Initiative within the context of the Partnerships Against Domestic Violence Strategy beyond June 2003; if not, what will replace this program. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: In the 2003-04 Budget the Government allocated an additional $19.6 million over four years to the Men and Family Relationships program, increasing total funding for this program to $41.6 million over eight years.

311,"Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister For Employment And Workplace Relations, Upon Notice","(2) How was such training or assistance provided? (3) How much does the Government plan to spend on providing such training or assistance in future? (1) and (3) The Government provides information to employees and employers on agreement making opportunities under the Workplace Relations Act. As this forms part of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations’ overall workplace relations service, it is not possible to disaggregate the amount spent to date on employees or how much will be spent in the future. (2) The Department provided this information through seminars on agreement making, its telephone advisory service (WageLine) and its online advisory service (Australian WorkPlace, including WageNet). Taxation: Bankruptcy Laws (Question No. 1849) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 14 May 2003: (1) Is he aware that Mr Clarrie Stevens, Mr John Cummins, Mr Stephen Archer, Mr Timothy Wardell, Mr Robert Somosi, and Mr Roger de Robilliard, who have been the subject of notorious taxation fraud and other breaches, and who were formerly holders of practising certificates and registered as Barristers on the roll of the New South Wales Bar Association, are no longer registered with that Bar Association. (2) Is he also aware that these persons were the subject of persistent adverse media coverage leading up to their ultimate discovery and expulsion as barristers on grounds of repeated abuse of licit legal instruments such as family court property orders, bankruptcy provisions including creditors petitions, family trusts and other instruments, for the sole or substantial purpose of either defrauding the Commonwealth of its revenue by evading taxation or placing assets out of the reach of the Taxation Commissioner who was usually their sole or principal creditor. (3) What preventive and punitive steps is he taking to ensure that it is not necessary for the media and public outcry to force action to be taken in these matters; if no action is being taken, why not? (1) I am aware of the allegations concerning a number of barristers, including some of those named in the honourable member’s question. As advised in my answer to your question on notice 1416, all States and Territories have codes of conduct for legal practitioners. The enforcement of those standards of conduct is a matter for the relevant State or Territory legal professional body and Supreme Court. The NSW Bar Association does not inform me of what action it takes in respect of individual barristers. (2) I am well aware generally of media coverage of the issue of high income professionals using bankruptcy law to avoid their taxation obligations. (3) As I indicated in my answer to your question on notice number 1416 (3), the Government has introduced changes to bankruptcy law aimed at preventing people using bankruptcy in an improper way. Amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 contained in the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Act 2002 allow Official Receivers to reject a debtor’s petition where it appears the debtor can afford to pay their debts and the petition is an abuse of the bankruptcy system. Other changes include strengthening of the trustee’s powers to object to the discharge from bankruptcy of uncooperative bankrupts after the standard three year bankruptcy period. In relation to the issue of high income earners using bankruptcy to avoid paying tax, following consideration of a report by an agency taskforce, the Government released an issues paper on possible further changes to bankruptcy and family law to address these issues.

313,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:open for comment until 20 February 2003. Comments received are being considered and will assist the Government in finalising its approach to this issue. In our joint press release of 2 May 2003 the Assistant Treasurer, Senator the Hon Helen Coonan, and I reported in detail on the progress made to date responding to the recommendations of the taskforce. However, a timeline for the introduction of any amendments to legislation that I administer flowing from the report and the submissions received in response to the issues paper cannot be determined until all of the submissions have been considered. Defence: Brighton Army Camp (Question No. 1863) Mr Kerr asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 14 May 2003: (1) What was the rateable valuation of the land at the Brighton Army Camp that was recently sold by the Department of Defence. (2) What, if any, other valuations did the Department of Defence or the Department of Finance and Administration obtain before the sale of the land and what were those valuations. (3) Was the land advertised to potential buyers with an indication that the expected price was in the range of $2 million; if not, what were the terms of the advertisements. (4) What was the price obtained for the land and are reports that this large area of land was sold for approximately $150,000 correct. (5) If the land was sold for substantially less than $2 million, why did the responsible Departments proceed with the sale for much less than the land’s valuation. (6) Is the Government aware of complaints from members of the Tasmanian community that the land has been disposed of for a fraction of its real value and in circumstances in which many other offers would have been made had the offer been put in terms that did not suggest that a price under $2 million would not have been acceptable to the vendor. (7) What is the Minister’s response to those who have expressed such concern and to those who believe the sale process was misleading and mishandled. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Office of the Valuer General for Tasmania valued the property for rating and taxing purposes on 1 August 1999 with a capital value of $2,400,000, a land value of $370,000 and an Assessed Annual Value of $98,000. (2) The Australian Valuation Office provided Defence with a market valuation of the property on 21 August 2002 at $200,000. (3) No. The property was advertised through a tender process. (4) $150,000 inclusive of GST. (5) The valuation of the capital value of the buildings in 1999 reflects the value of the buildings based on the Defence’s use at the time. The valuation in 2002 by the Australian Valuation Office of $200,000 reflects the estimated market value of the property based on a tender process. The decision to proceed with the sale of the property was in line with the market valuation. (6) Yes. (7) The property was placed on the open market via a tender process and later through an Agency Listing in line with the Commonwealth Property Disposals Policy. This provided potential purchasers over nine weeks to submit an offer for the site. The price achieved represents the true market value.

(2) Is there a generic position, or are these pensions or payments assessed on a country by country basis. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) In general, unless they are specifically exempted under the Social Security Act, compensatory pensions paid to victims of political persecution are assessed as income for social security purposes. Specific legislative exemptions have been made for: Amounts paid as compensation to victims of National Socialist (Nazi) persecution from Germany (1987) and Austria (1989). As announced in the 2003 Budget, all payments made as compensation for Nazi persecution will be exempt from the social security income test, regardless of the country making the payment, with effect from 13 May 2003.
