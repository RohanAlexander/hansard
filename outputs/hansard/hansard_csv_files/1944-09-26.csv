10,Mr Ward,"(East Sydney-Ministe ronly passengers on tlie plane by which they travelled. So that there does not appear to be any doubt that this was a special plane provided -by Australian National Airways for the sole purpose of conveying them to Sydney. It was also intimated that they were to return by special plane, but because of a faulty engine, repairs to which could not be completed under fourteen days, return air travel could not be provided in time for the reopening of the school, and therefore it was decided that they should endeavour tc obtain permission to make the journey by rail. All applications made to this deissuing officer, I must add that it partment for rail travel permits were refused. Among those who applied were the Honourable David Loder, the son of the Governor of New South Wales, Lord Wakehurst, and the son of Captain Holyman, a director of Australian National Airways. I am informed that evidence points to the fact that this is the person who arranged for the provision of the special plane. Action was taken to have an officer of the Commonwealth Transport Department, who is stationed at Albury, police the arrival of all trains from Sydney to intercept any of the boys who might be journeying interstate without the required authority. On Thursday, the 14th September, four were detected attempting to border-hop at Albury. Hugh Dixon, C. A. Taylor, Colin G. Smith, and R. Cobden. Statements were taken from these young men, who admitted that they had purchased tickets to Albury and were presenting their identity cards bearing their Melbourne addresses for the purpose of obtaining a ticket from Albury to Melbourne. As a definite breach of Commonwealth Transport has occurred in these cases, prosecutions are being authorized, and similar action will be taken in any other cases where breaches are detected. It has been ascertained that two of these young men, namely, the son of Colonel Wynn and the son of Lord Wakehurst, arranged return bookings by boat, whilst to a third, named White-, a permit was issued iby the New South Wales Railways authorities on Wednesday the 13th September. When the issuing officer was asked why this permit had been granted, Mr Ward. he stated that the case was represented by Messrs. Pitt Son& Badgery Limited as being one in which the young man had travelled from Melbourne to Sydney by plane for the purpose of assisting his people with the shearing at Belltrees, Scone, New South Wales, and as he was unable to obtain a return booking by air, he desired to be .granted a rail permit. The issuing officer was informed that the' permit in this case should not have been issued without reference to this department in order that inquiries might be made to substantiate the claim. However, in fairness to the would appear that the facts were not disclosed by Messrs. Pitt Son& Badgery Limited. At the moment it cannot be ascertained whether the remainder of the young men have returned to Melbourne by private car, air, or other means of transport, but directions have been issued that in no circumstances are permits to be granted for travel by rail. for Supply and Shipping whether it is intended to complete, during this sessional period, consideration of the bill relating to the production of aluminium, which he has obtained leave to introduce? to do.

Minister and Minister for Defence). -by leave-It is regrettable that there should be misunderstanding regarding the general subject of Australia's position in relation to food supply to the United Kingdom. The Government has never considered that it should explain the position in detail because that would have involved the publication of statistics of food production and allocations in a way which would be regarded as unwise in war-time. However, it is now necessary, in justice to the Australian Government, and in order to avoid misunderstanding with the British Government, that I should make a formal statement on the matter, and give such statistical information as can safely be disclosed publicly. In pre-war days, the United Kingdom was dependent on imports for a large proportion of its food requirements. To cite a few examples: Britain imported during certain pre-war years 87 per cent, of its wheaten flour; 41 per cent, of meat; 92 per cent, of fats, comprising butter, lard and margarine; 39 per cent, of eggs; 77 per cent, of f r u it ; and 73 per cent, of sugar. Australia's contribution to Britain's imports of important foods in pre-war years varied according to seasons. Of the total imports, our contributions were: Wheat and flour, from 8 per cent, to 20 per cent.; meat, from 10 per cent, to 12 per cent.; dairy produce, from 12 per cent, to 17 per cent.; and fresh fruit and vegetables, from 5 per cent, to 6 per cent. The British market took most of Australia's export surplus of the important foods. In 1938-39 the United Kingdom took -the following proportions of our exports:-Butter, 95 per cent.; meat, 90 per cent.; canned fruits, 85 per cent.; dried vine fruits, 71 per cent.; sugar, 88 per cent.; and eggs, 99 per cent. These figures reveal that whilst the United Kingdom took in peace-time most of Australia's food exports, Australia did not supply the larger part of its food imports. In peace-time, the United Kingdom is the market for every food-exporting country in the world, and the Dominions have had a preferred position in the United Kingdom since the conclusion of the Ottawa Agreement in 1932. Honourable members will see, however, that Australia supplies a relatively modest proportion of Britain's total food imports. The war has adversely affected Great Britain's food supplies in several ways. First, it cut off food supplies which went to Great Britain in very large quantities from a number of European countries; then, shipping deficiencies greatly reduced the tonnage available to carry food, and the battle of the Atlantic sent to the bottom of the sea very large quantities of food. The third great interference with the food supplies of the civilians of Great Britain has been the necessity to feed millions of fighting",17,Australians Inunit Ed Kingdom Services

43,Mr Curtin (Fremantle,"Primemen in all theatres of war. This responsibility to feed the fighting men has been undertaken and discharged by all members of the United Nations according to their varied capacities. It is well to remember that Great Britain itself was forced, at the very outset, by the exigencies of war, to discontinue importation of fresh fruit and canned fruit and, later,on, of eggs, and as far as wheat and flour were concerned, to concentrate upon their transportation chiefly from the nearer sources of supply in North and South America. There were also serious problems of storage in Australia and transportation to the United Kingdom of dairy produce and meat, but by close co-operation between Great Britain and the Commonwealth, disaster to the Australian producers was consistently averted, sometimes very narrowly. The whole complexion of the food problem was changed when Japan came into the war. Australia's food problems ceased to concern surpluses, and related entirely to the constant threat of deficiences. The causes of this change are known to those who care to think. They are: The call to the colours of able bodied men from all over Australia when Japan threatened to invade this country; the privilege and obligation to feed fighting men of the United States of America, who came quickly here, first to assist in our defence and then to push the enemy back and defeat him; the aggravation of the difficulties of production caused 925,000,000 gallons was used to produce by adverse seasonal conditions and, in Victoria, by the disastrous bush fires of 1943. I doubt whether any one in Australia would say that any discredit is attached to the Australian Government in respect of any of these matters. I make no apology for what was done. By the combination of all efforts oi ourselves and our gallant Allies, Australia was saved from invasion. I now give to the House particulars of gallons for consumption in liquid form. the production and allocation of two of the principal foods which enter into the production have been debated frequently export trade from Australia to Great in this House, and I do not wish to Britain in peace-time, and which Great discuss them in this statement beyond Britain needs urgently in war-time. I what I have briefly said earlier. Suffice refer first to meat. In the year 1938-39, it to say that the Government has recogAustralia produced 963,000 tons of all nized the need for organizing the return classes of meat. Of that total, our own of as many men to the dairying industry people consumed 722,000 tons, we sent 223,000 tons to the United Kingdom, and exported 18,000 tons elsewhere. This year we expect, in spite of the drought, to produce 1,000,000 tons of meat. ""We hope, through rationing, to reduce Australian civilian consumption to 540,000 tons. We have undertaken, in respect of the balance, to make and observe the following allocations:Tons. United Kingdom Ministry of Food and United Kingdom Services .. 178,000 Australian Services .. .. 124,000 United States Services .. .. 158,000 The original allocation to the United Kingdom for 1944 was 200,000 tons. It would have remained at that figure had it not been possible, in full and complete agreement with the United Kingdom and the United States of America, to reallocate supplies so that the United States would send increased supplies to the United Kingdom, and Australia would divert some of its supplies to the American forces in the South Pacific and South-West Pacific Areas. I repeat that this was done with the full agreement of the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States. We gave satisfaction to both, and we earned and retain the goodwill of both. I invite the critics to examine these figures and then say what they think about them."" The production position is less favorable in regard to dairy products. The production of milk in the year 1938-39 was 1,189,000,000 gallons, of which butter, 65,000,000 gallons to produce cheese, 36,000,000 gallons to produce condensed and dried milk, and 163,000,000 gallons for consumption in liquid form. In the year 1943-44 the total production of milk was 1,052,000,000 gallons, of which 716,000,000 gallons was used to produce butter, 78,000,000 to produce cheese, 63,000,000 gallons for condensed and powdered milk, and 195,000,000 The causes of the decline in total milk as is consistent with military necessity. The paramount need of the dairying industry for labour has caused the Government recently to take special steps for the release of men, now in the forces, who have been nominated by dairy-farmers for work on their farms. In addition to the decline in total milk production, the following changes have occurred: Australian civilians are now consuming more liquid milk than they did before the war. It has been necessary, for the feeding of the fighting services, greatly to increase the production of cheese and condensed and powdered milk. The consequence of decreased total production, increased Australian civilian consumption of liquid milk, increased production of cheese and processed milks for the services, has been a very big decline of butter production. I now cite the figures for butter production and allocationsAustralian Exports tion. 1938-39.. 1944 * Estimate. 9.000 tons to United States services. Too much time would be required to include equally detailed references to the other important food items, but I can assure honourable members that, in respect of canned fruits, dried fruits, flour, eggs, sugar, and the like, we are in constant close touch with the British Government which understands the difficulties associated with increased production and the obligations imposed on Australia to feed the fighting services in this theatre of war. I fully and freely acknowledge that Australian civilians, in spite of the rationing of butter and meat and other minor food shortages, have much more liberal supplies of food than have the civilians of Britain. The Australian deliberately rationed butter and meat to ensure supplies to the civilians of Britain, and will continue such rationing. We shall do everything in our power to increase production so that we may be able to live up to our constantly expanding obligations to the fighting services, Mr Otirtin. and to maintain supplies for Britain on as large a scale as possible. On the problem of transport of food to Britain, I had discussions with the British Minister of War Transport, Lord Leathers, when I was in London. Lord Leathers told me and confirmed in writing that, on the best possible estimate of the shipping position during 1945 and possibly the first part of 1946, he could not ask Australia to make a special effort to increase the quantity of meat, butter and other dairy produce, since the amount of refrigerated tonnage available to move cargo was limited, and would not allow of any significant increase of shipments to Britain over the level of the early part of 1944. In considering the 1945 food allocations, I have arranged that Australia shall maintain during 1945 the same level of food supplies to Britain as in 1944. I subsequently received advice from the British Minister of Eood, Mr J. J. Production. consumpto Exports elsewhere.

Leader of the Australian Country Party) [3.55] -The heading, ""Departments and Services, other than Business Undertakings and Territories of the Commonwealth "" obviously includes the Allied Works Council, and I desire to obtain some information about this very important and costly organization. In my budget speech, I asked the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) to prepare a schedule Department of the Interior is specified in Division No. 9. The items are listed, and the estimated cost of the proposed works is £63,900. Whilst those works may be discussed, I submit that the right honourable gentleman would not be in order in referring to the general administration of the Department of the Interior, because the time for doing so has passed. the Department of the Interior will undertake those works, and the Minister for the Interior (Senator Collings) is responsible for the activities of the Allied Works Council. Honourable members have no other opportunity to discuss this huge national undertaking, which is costing the country millions of pounds annually. I cannot understand the submission of the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) that attention may not be drawn to the Allied Works Council at this juncture. The question before the Chair is a Supply vote, and on it the right honourable member will be in order in discussing the Department of the Interior. the Interior, which controls the Allied Works Council, should present to the Parliament sufficient information to enable honourable members to ascertain whether value is being obtained for the money expended. For that reason, I asked the Treasurer to supply a complete schedule of the expenditure of the Allied Works Council for the last financial year, the estimated expenditure for this financial year, the number of staff employed, the salaries and wages bill for the two years 1942-43 and 1943-44, and the estimated expenditure for 1944-45. Although the Allied Works Council is the biggest spending authority in Australia, the budget-papers do not contain any information about it. Honourable members must have this information in order to discharge their responsibilities to the people and to keep a vigilant watch upon expenditure. WhilstI give to the Allied Works Council full credit for the good work that it has carried out, I emphasize that its activities have been conducted at enormous expense. Whether the country has received value for the The money expended is a matter for inquiry by honourable members, who are responsible for watching the interests of taxpayers.

63,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"some information about what is happening in the Allied Works Council. Statements which have been published in the press lately regarding the future of the Allied Works Council require an official reply. The suggestion, which has appeared in certain newspapers from time to time, is that the Government is toying with the idea of constituting the Allied Works Council as a works authority in peace-time. Such a proposal does not appeal to me. I have been in two of the territories of the Commonwealth in which this organization has operated, and and I have seen some of its estimates relating to the cost of projects. At Alice Springs, the Army took control of the Australian Inland Mission Hospital, and I requested the Army to replace it with a similar building. When the Allied Works Council was asked to prepare an estimate for the building the figure supposition to announce the intentions of plied was £8,500. At the outside, the work should not cost more than £1,500. One of the jokes in Alice Springs is to ask what it cost the Commonwealth Bank to have its one-story office erected there, because local opinion believes that pleted there will be nothing to justify the cost per foot was more than the cost of the head office in Martin-place, Sydney. Good reasons can be advanced why the Commonwealth Government should make a statement about the activities and cost of the Allied Works. Council. The information, if given, will be startling. The time is overdue also for a statement about the future of this body. The Government would be unwise to reach a decision relating to the future of the organization in peace-time until it has obtained the views of the House of Representatives. Minister and Minister for Defence) [4.2] I was examining the last report of the Allied Works Council this morning but, unfortunately, it has been returned to the department. I have sent for it. The Government cannot possibly give the information which the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr frequently is national or party security. Fadden) seeks, because a substantial part of the expenditure is included in general war expenditure. The Allied Works Council has carried out works for all the Services and it would be highly improper to give their cost and location. As to the estimated expenditure for this year, all I can say is that the Government has been given a round figure. As the right honoraible gentleman and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) know, certain works will be required in the current financial year, not only by Australia, but also by other governments. Particulars of those projects have not yet come to hand and I do not know what the costs will be. Insofar as it is physically within the capacity of this country to carry out those works, they will be undertaken by the Allied Works Council, which was created for that purpose. The total strength of the Allied Works Council has been drastically reduced, and further contractions are still taking place. A t this stage, I am not in a the Government regarding the future of the Allied Works Council other than to remind honoraible members that the organization was formed to do essential war jobs, and when they have been comits continuance. The Government proposes to continue the Allied Works Council only so long as it is required to carry out works and services necessary for war operations. I assure the Leader of the Australian Country party that I shall examine the report to see whether I can table it. If the document contains confidential information, I shall endeavour to prepare a revised report that can he laid on the table of the House, or in the Library. able members are not likely to be satisfied by the remarks of the Prime Minister concerning the activities of the Allied Works Council. The claim that security is likely to be infringed by the disclosure of detailed information to the Parliament has been advanced far too frequently by this Government.

I shall mention one or two of them -First, there is the gravthose erected by contract cost £30,0-00 ing dock at Sydney. It is no secret that we have been engaged on the construction of this dock. Full details of the project were announced by a previous government and estimates were given of the probable cost. A great deal of publicity has been given to the work by this Government during the last two years. Everybody knows that the original estimates of cost have been very greatly exceeded. How could security be infringed by the Government explaining to the committee the reasons why the original estimate for this project may have been trebled? Surely the security element cannot enter into the matter at all. Members of the Government are well aware that State instrumentalities have been called upon for help in connection with this work, and there is reason to believe that some of them have been feathering their own nests at the expense of the Commonwealth in the carrying out of these projects. We are entitled to information on this subject without being told that security may be infringed if details are given. member mean by ""feathering their own nests "" ? Minister that the position of certain State instrumentalities has been very greatly improved by reason of their activities on behalf of the Commonwealth in connection with the graving dock. I know the facts, and so does the Prime Minister. The right honourable gentleman has a duty to the country to disclose the facts, but when we ask for information we are told that for „ security reasons it cannot be given. I cannot understand how considerations of security can enter into this subject. The information for which we ask should be made available to us. the honourable I turn now to work that is being done at Albert Park, Victoria, to provide accommodation for service personnel who have hitherto been accommodated in public schools and other educational establishments in Victoria. It has been reported to me that certain of these buildings have been constructed by day labour and others by contract, and that each less than those erected by day labour. I do not know whether this is true, but the information was given to me by a. Melbourne citizen who would not have told me somethingthat he did not himself believe to be correct.

It may be that if the information which we desire was given to. us the Allied Works Council would appear in a much better light than it does at present.

The blanket of security is being thrown over too many of our public works, and I contend that we have the strongest reasons for protesting against the refusal of Ministers to give us the information that we seek from time to time. I bring to the notice of the Prime Minister the difficulties under which private members of Parliament are being obliged to do their work, particularly in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Recently, the Federal Members' Roomsi n Sydney have been re-arranged so as to provide offices for jill honourable members representing city constituencies.

A t present, private members of this Parliament are being inundated by correspondence covering a great variety of subjects which formerly fell within the province of members of State parliaments. wealth has taken over so many of these functions, the private members of this Parliament are being asked to take action in regard to them. Owing to the lack of clerical assistance and adequate office accommodation, it is becoming almost impossible for us to do our work efficiently. There is a disposition on the part of this Government to regard somewhat contemptuously the functions of private members of the Parliament, but, after all, private members are an essential part of this great instrument of democracy, and are entitled to proper facilities to do their important work. of the Ministry w ill be private members again some day. Government's stinginess-and I use that word deliberately-w e are not able to do our work properly. If private members of the Parliament are to be obliged to spend their time sealing envelopes, licking stamps and doing other minor clerical work of that kind, obviously they cannot devote proper attention to the big national problems that should be occupying their thought. I complain bitterly about the treatment that we are receiving from this Government, for we cannot properly represent our constituents. I understand that the work being done at the Federal Members' Rooms, Sydney, has been almost completed. W it h some reluctance I wrote to the Prime Minister personally on this subject some time ago. I consider the matter is of very great importance. Private members need more clerical assistance than they are receiving. Many honourable members, of whom I am one, cannot properly discharge their parliamentary duties w i th the assistance that they now get. Because of the positions which they hold in the Ministry and on other bodies, the majorit y of honourable members on the provided for them. The cost of providing A t any rate, very facilities comparable with those enjoyed by members of the American Congress to discharge their duties and the Canadian Parliament would be a mere bagatelle.

Our status and privileges compare unf avorably with those of the members of other dominion parliaments. As an upholder of democracy, I appeal to the Prime Minister and other Ministers to ensure that private members shall have reasonable consideration in all these matters. Ministers and ex-Ministers enjoy extraordinary concessions of all sorts. WereI to give details, some of them might astonish the general public. Adequate clerical assistance, as well as ample Local people tried to light up the landing office accommodation, not only in the capital cities, but also wherever else they may be required, should be provided. Transport for members could be very greatly improved. I have air transport, particularly, in mind. While I was abroad last year, I noticed that members of the Congress of the United States of America and the Parliament of Canada who lived in distant parts were privileged to journey by air to and from their electorates. I realize that such a facility might not be possible in a general way under existing conditions in Australia; nevertheless, certain air routes could he used, and private members should receive preference over the many scores of departmental officials who now have priority and travel in comfort, whereas a member of Parliament has to take his chance with the general public. This appeal is not actuated by the desire that members should have facilities far superior to those of the ordinary citizen. The point that I make is, that they definitely need help, in order to discharge their duties properly, and to raise their prestige, which has been attacked by certain interests with the object of lowering them in the esteem of the public. The proposed appropriation for the Department of Civil Aviation is £1,208,000. I plead for the expenditure of a portion of it on safety measures in connection with flying during war-time, as well as in making certain that the best use will be made of our air services when the war is over. I notice that £6,000 has been placed on the Estimates for the purpose of making grants to municipal councils wishing to establish or improve country aerodromes. I suggest that the amount might well be greatly increased. In the part of Australia with which I am familiar, the councils are only too willing to assist the Commonwealth to improve landing grounds. Some time ago, aeroplanes to the value of £250,000 were lost near Grafton because the aerodrome was not lighted. The planes, which had flown from the United States of America, had followed the radio beam 2NR, and found themselves over the Clarence River between Maclean and Grafton, having mistaken the direction to Brisbane. ground with the headlights of their cars, but the planes were not able to pick up the aerodrome until they had almost passed over it, with the result that when they touched down they ran on into a belt of trees and swamp and some were destroyed. I am told that pilots can see the great U-shaped bend in the Clarence River, near Grafton, for a distance of 100 miles, and if the aerodrome near this bend were lighted it would make a perfectly safe landing area. Other accidents have occurred within 10 miles of this place when the planes, having lost their bearings, ran out of petrol. A permanent seaplane landing base should be established at Maclean. Within the last month, an American plane flying from New Guinea with the film comedian Bob Hope and other film stars on board, crashed at Laurieton, and it was providential that all were not killed. Lake Wallis is a sheet of water 8 miles in diameter alongside Laurieton, and it would be a suitable place for sea-planes to come down on if it were marked with buoys. All along the east coast from Melbourne tu Cairns there are spots which, for the cost of a few hundred pounds, could be turned into suitable landing places, and flying would be made a great deal safer, not only for servicemen during the war, but also for civil aviation when the war is over. It would cost only £3,000 to make the landing ground at Grafton safe for both day and night flying; yet, when the accident occurred to the American planes two years ago, the authorities installed up to 50 members of the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force with radio equipment at",26,Frederick Stewart No T All Of Government Side Have Clerical Assistance

I hope that the Postmaster-General will shortly be able to arrange for the broadcasting 'of the debates of Parliament. At the present time, it is left to the press to acquaint the public with what goes on in Parliament, and some sections of the press are not interested, or are not sympathetic to the Government. Sometimes the press reports convey a wrong impression. There is a tendency to disparage parliamentarians and parliamentary institutions, perhaps with a view of bringing about a totalitarian form of government. The public cannot conveniently come to Canberra, especially in these days of restricted travel, so the only thing to do is to take Parliament to the people, and that can be done by broadcasting the debates, as is now done in New Zealand. The broadcasting of debates will make tb.fi public politically minded, and induce them to take a greater interest in public affairs, and future referendums may have better results. [4.45] -As the war progresses many of the flying schools on which hundreds of thousands of pounds have been expended in the provision of runways and other facilities will be gradually closed. I understand that in one district of Victoria two such schools have already been closed or are about to be closed. I suggest that the Department of Civil Aviation should immediately take control of all aerodromes when they become no of town. longer necessary for the training of air crews for war purposes, so that, when the very near to the Central Railway Station, war ends, they shall be available for use and the tramlines are only a few paces in the development of civil air services. distant.

The staff, conduct of the social services of the which consists of 300 persons, of whom 250 are women, is accommodated in a badly ventilated old building which was formerly used as a drug store, and is inadequate for its present purpose. Next year additional social services, including hospital benefits, unemployment and sickness benefits, and pharmaceutical benefits will be operated by the department. Old people who await their turn for interviews have to sit on stools in a dirty corridor. In the child endowment office, people have to wait sitting on stools with their backs to the counter, and then, if they are hard of hearing, they have to kneel on the stools in order to hear what the clerk behind the counter is saying. That such conditions should exist in a big city like Sydney is a reflection on the Commonwealth Government, and the Government should immediately rectify the position. There is an ideal site in Prince Alfred Park, within 200 or 300 yards of the Central Railway Station, for a new building to house the Social Services Department and the Repatriation Department. The site is passed by almost every tram that comes into Sydney, and the trains are, as I said, only a couple of hundred yards distant. The 80 or 90 years old Exhibition Building in Prince Alfred Park ought to be demolished and a building for the Social Services Department and the Repatriation Department, which, after the war, will have greatly increased responsibilities, erected on the site it occupies. There would thereby be no encroachment on park land. order that all its sections may be housed in the one building.",28,Frederick Stewart No T All Of Government Side Have Clerical Assistance

91,Sir Frederick Stewart (Parra,"Commonwealth. Even those of us who are not nearly so optimistic as is the honourable member about the development of the Social Services Department cannot fail to appreciate that, in the very nature of things, better provision will be needed for the carrying out of the work of that department. As a former Minister for Social Services, I know the difficulty which comes from having inappropriate accommodation. Perhaps an even more important aspect of the matter is the need to provide for the convenience and comfort of the aged people who find it necessary to go to the department. I should like some light to be thrown on an item in the Works Estimates of* the Repatriation Department. The provision asked for is £300,000, but there is a footof certain power alcohol distilleries. I note indicating a further estimated liability of £199,000. indication of the purpose to which that money is to be applied, and I think this committee is entitled to know. I see no amount of a corresponding size for the War Service Homes Commission, the only appropriation for which is in respect of a formal adjustment of accounts. The time has arrived when the Government should seriously consider the appropriation of sufficient money to enable the War Service Homes Commission to resume building operations, because for many men the end of the war is not a matter of a year or two years hence; their active participation in it has already ended, and their repatriation and rehabilitation has begun. This is the. time when they should be able to take their wives and families away from the conditions under which they have been subsisting while the men have been members of the forces. I wish it were possible for the Government to divert to that purpose some of the millions of pounds which are being appropriated. I have looked in vain for some trace of the source from which the money is coming which is now being used for the housing of, not ex-servicemen, but war workers. I am sure I speak for other honourable members who have viewed with some concern the building in Lithgow, Orange and other country centres of slum-like dwellings for workers in the munitions industry. If , as I suspect, the Sir Frederick Stewart. expenditure in that direction is wrapped up with the other part of the Estimates dealing with war departments, I would be out of order in discussing it at this stage. But as it is seemingly possible to find considerable sums of money to provide houses for workers in munitions factories and otherwise-and to-day I have received an invitation to attend the inspection of a building project in my own electorate, the money for which has been provided by the Commonwealth Government-it should he possible to make some definite provision for the .building of war service homes, and I commend that suggestion seriously to the Government. Estimates there is provision for the erection by the Department of the Interior question the advisability of proceeding There is no with the construction of distilleries designed to convert wheat into power alcohol under the conditions under which it is intended to use that wheat, and to pay the farmers for it. In view of the seasonal prospects in Australia, the mounting wheat market to which we are able to look forward, the easier position in respect of liquid fuels to-day, and the likelihood that that position will become even easier when the European war is finished, I question whether the Government is doing the right thing in proceeding with its intention, which, no doubt, was a very good intention when it was conceived, toconvert many millions of bushels of wheat into power alcohol. The growers of wheat are vitally concerned in this matter in that they are to be paid for their wheat only 3s. H i d . a bushel at a time when there is a big overseas market for wheat at a figure approaching twice that amount. I understand that the wheat which will be converted into power alcohol will be bought at 3s. l l f d . a bushel, whereas the price fixed by the Australian Wheat Board for wheat for export is no less than 6s. 6jd. a bushel. I consider myself bound to question the advisability of passing the sums which are proposed to be used for the provision of the distilleries. The wheat-growers feel that, having passed through years of extraordinarily low prices, they are entitled to enjoy the benefit of the higher market prevailing.",29,Frederick Stewart No T All Of Government Side Have Clerical Assistance

"" Hush-hushville "" a few weeks ago, and I would say that the expenditure of scores of thousands of pounds is still proceeding. I saw a vast bin which I was told was designed to hold 1,250,000 bushels of wheat. That bin was not completed. well, but I am speaking of a bin. I have no doubt that that work is provided for in some of the money covered by the vote that we are now discussing. Circumstances' have so vastly changed since the previous Government formulated the proposals for erecting power alcohol distilleries, that substantial justisumption requirements, stock feed refication exists for reviewing the whole project. I know that the impression has got abroad, not by accident (but by deliberate propaganda., that it was the Curtin Government which decided to erect power alcohol distilleries in Australia. That impression, which is entirely wrong, is in line with the story that it was the iCurtin Government which decided to erect the pipe line from the river Murray to Whyalla. These, and most of the other great national projects which are covered either wholly or in part in these new works programmes, will be found on examination to have had their origin in the decisions of previous governments. member is criticizing governments in wldch he was a Minister. am pointing out that circumstances have changed. desirous of emphasizing the fact that an extraordinary injustice will be done to the wheat-growers of Australia, who are facing the most disastrous season in our history, if millions of bushels of wheat, which they grew in bountiful seasons, are sold to power alcohol distilleries at 3s. l l ^ d . a bushel, when there is a ready market for it overseas at the price fixed by the Australian Wheat Board, namely, 6s. 6id. a bushel. This Government, which preens itself on being a friend of wheat-growers, seizes wheat from farmers, and sells it at an extraordinary variety of prices. As the result of the decision of this Government, Australian wheat is sold to the Government of New Zealand for less than 5s. a bushel. The wheat-growers are entitled to be paid the price that the wheat is worth. When overseas buyers were purchasing wheat here at 7s. 6d. a bushel, wheat from the same silos was being poured into power alcohol distilleries and the growers received for it only 3s. l l j d . a bushel. If these works be completed, more wheat will be poured into additional power alcohol distilleries, involving the growers in heavier losses. Before that happens, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture should assure the chamber that enough wheat is available, on present crop estimates, to fulfil our home conquirements, obligations to feed Allied troops in this theatre, our contracts with the United Kingdom Government and additional contracts which, I have every reason to believe, the United Kingdom Government is anxious to conclude at the present time. According to my information, the United Kingdom Government is prepared to pay Australia more than 6s. a bushel f.o.b. for all the wheat that may be available for sale between now and the 1945-46 harvest. If the Government does not conclude that contract with the United Kingdom Government, but pours vast quantities of wheat into power alcohol distilleries at 3s. l l ^ d . a bushel, the growers will suffer a loss, between now and the conclusion of the 1945-46 harvest, of at least £10,000,000. Wheat growers cannot afford to have such a tremendous sum stolen from them. They have endured very heavy losses during the last ten or fifteen years. A t one More particularly am I period, the erection of power alcohol distilleries appeared to be a stabilizing factor.

But before these Estimates are agreed to, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture should indicate whether, in view of the present disastrous season, Australia can afford to provide wheat for power alcohol distilleries, particularly at 3s. ll£d. a bushel, when the grain could be sold readily at the price fixed for export sales by the Australian Wheat Board, namely, 6s. 6^d. a bushel I should like the Government to' gratulate the Minister for the Interior (Senator Collings) on providing this money for works to be undertaken by his department, not only in connection with the immediate war effort, but also as a basis for post-war developments that will assist primary industries in the diffiAlthough building and operating costs cult times ahead. The fact that our primary industries will face difficulties in the future, as they have in the past, is borne out by the policy of the United States of America to discourage the repatriation of ex-servicemen on the land. The reason is that the increased productivity in primary industry has made it problematical whether there will be a world market for the produce of the farms, even at the present rate of production. mechanized farming methods, the problem will be accentuated. The particular phase of development to which the honourable member for elaboration. Power alcohol distilleries in Australia, apart from providing material for the war effort, have also yielded useful stock feed. The contention that farmers have not received for their wheat the price that should be paid, must not be allowed to detract from the value of the power alcohol distilleries. In the past, the wheat leries at a substantially lower price. The industry encountered many difficulties. World surpluses came without warning. If , in the post-war period, we are to wait until some project can be evolved to absorb our wheat surpluses, by the time it is brought into being the need to find such means of disposal will have passed. Therefore, a short-term approach to the matter is wrong. More money should be expended upon power alcohol projects. At present, the distillery at Cowra is sending stock feed in solution to waste land, and this is creating a nuisance. Dr. Harm an, of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, informed me that by the expenditure of an additional £10,000, the difficulty could be overcome and substantially more cheap stock feed could be produced as a by-product of the distillery. supply to honourable members some information about the progress of the distillery at Warracknabeal, in Victoria.

[5.14] I am deeply interested in the matter raised by the honourable member a debate took place in this chamber upon that subject, and I listened with a good deal of interest, but without much satisfaction, to a statement by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Department of the Interior"". To Scully). Power alcohol is a burning question. question all right. Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) is one of the handiest fellows in this chamber. He may be able to give me some information about a matter which I should like to clear up quickly. Last week the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture said that the farmers would be paid the average of the wheat realizations on disposal. Will the proceeds from the wheat sold to power alcohol distilleries be included in determining the average ? This is a most important question. L ask the Minister to tell us specifically whether all the wheat sold under different methods in Australia and subject to subventions of one kind or another, as well as all the wheat sold overseas, will be brought into consideration in arriving at the average price. When the honourable gentleman addressed the House last week on the adjournment motion, he did not make himself clear in certain respects, and it was necessary for him to clarify his statement the next day. I feel justified, therefore, in asking him to give a considered answer to my specific question, so that the farmers may know where they stand. with the Works Estimates? out to the Minister for Home Security that provision is being made for the construction of power alcohol distilleries. In fact, the item "" Buildings, works, sites, Commission of £200,000. I do not know fittings and furniture"" appears under several headings without any kind of explanation. It is a kind of "" abracadabra "" or "" open sesame"". I ask for [50] some information about the item "" Buildings, works, sites, fittings and furniture, £1,100"" under ""Parliament"". I am aware that certain work has been going on in this building near the Librarian's quarters. I also saw three or four men chipping defective plaster from the external walls of this building. An item ""Buildings, works, sites, fittings and furniture, £90,000"" appears under the sub-heading "" Under the control of the this there is a footnote: "" Estimated further liability, £70,000"". Under this is a burning item, therefore, we are being asked to approve of an expenditure o£ £160,000. What shall we have to show for the money? Will it be a legation at Timbuctoo? Under the Department of External Affairs there is an item "" Australian Ministeri n the United States of America-Equipment and extension of legation, £22,000 "". Another item reads: "" Australian High Commissioner in India -Equipment for office and residence, £4,600 "". The total of the proposed vote under the Department of External Affairs is £30,700. So far as I know this expenditure has not been approved by the Public Works Committee, or any other authority to which this Parliament can look for advice on such a subject. We are also to approve of an expenditure of £10,700 under the Department of the Treasury, and that wonderful line, ""Buildings, works, sites, fittings and furniture "" reappears. It also appears in relation to a proposed vote of £3,600 for the Attorney-General's Department. The proposed expenditure by the Department of the Interior is £63,900, and it covers expenditure of a trifle of £100 under the River Murray Waters Act, and £57,700 under the heading "" Commonwealth offices and other buildings-Architectura l and other engineering services "". No detailed information is given about any of these items. The Government is almost bludgeoning this business through the committee. We are asked to approve of an expenditure by the War Service Homes whether this is intended to meet the cost of next year's building programme by the commission, but obviously it cannot possibly do so.

A reasonable survey is necessary in connection with any housing programme intended to meet the needs of ex-servicemen. A large sum will be required even for the purchase of sites. I have mentioned these special items in order to show the wide scope of the expenditure we are being asked to approve. Earlier this afternoon the honourable member for New England( Mr two places ""Buildings, works and sites, Abbott) mentioned the Government's housing programme for service personnel, and suggested that there was a tendency to differentiate between cities and country length to the proposed vote for the districts in this matter. As my electorate is 25 per cent, city and 75 per cent, country, I am deeply interested in this subject. I sincerely hope that no such differentiation will occur. The people who live in the country are entitled to facilities and conveniences equal to those enjoyed by people who live in the cities. In due course, I suppose, a statement will be made on this subject by the Minister administering war service homes, but it seems that little reliance can be placed on anything that is said by junior Ministers, which means all the Ministers excepting the Prime Minister, for that right honourable gentleman toid us last Thursday that only he would make statements on government policy. The proposed vote for the Department of Civil Aviation, which totals £1,208,000, is also interesting me. It includes the item communication and navigation facilities; power generation and distribution plant; direct current and audiofrequency control lines; automatic switchnexion with the Department of Coming equipment; aerodrome and air route lighting equipment, £265,000"" and also the item "" Aircraft engines, vehicles and equipment, £129,000 "".

I ask why detailed information is not being given to us on this subject?

I am receiving maps, periodicals and other information on this subject, which indicate, to me how important it is, and I am reading the com-' munications as actively as I read the Scriptures. Division No. 14, under Department of Civil Aviation, mentions in including shore bases and marine facilities, fittings and furniture "", but no detail is given to us. I could refer at some Department of Trade and Customs,but will not do so, and concerning the proposed vote for the Department of Health, I shall refer to only one matter. The milk supply of Alice Springs is of great importance. I am glad that the Minister for the Interior (Senator Collings) is doing something to provide milk for school children at Alice Springs, though he has not gone as far as he should go, for his action has only alleviated the situation. There are 470 school children in the town, which is without a fresh milk supply. The people are asking for a depot, and the provision of a proper milk supply, in order to safeguard the health of the children. The proposed vote for the Department of Repatriation consists of provision for to the old formula"" Buildings, works, sites, ""Aeradio fittings and furniture"". It amounts to £300,000, but there is again a footnote""estimated further liability, £199,000"". The same formula is used in conmerce and Agriculture, the amount of the appropriation being £600. Howi t is proposed to allot the expenditure, I do not know. Other appropriations are, £2,200 for the Department of Social Services and £6,600 for the Department of Supply and Shipping. Speaking generally, the Estimates are poorly presented. Too much is told about little items and nothing at all about some of the big items. Several very does not devote much more time to a detailed study of the Estimates. That relates to some of the items that were passed last week, while many honourable members were asleep.

The proposed vote for 1944-45 is £5,000. Most of these buildings consist of wood and galvanized iron, and very many other materials manufactured in Victoria, which are sent forward as required. Sea transport is essential. I was astounded when I read in the newspaper reports of the Court of Marine Inquiry concerning a collision at sea off Montague Island, that the steamship Weir was travelling in ballast from Melbourne to Newcastle when it came into collision with another vessel and was sunk. Material that is urgently required for the particular buildings to which I am referring is not being sent forward as rapidly as it could be if vessels travelling round the Australian eoasts are in ballast and not being used for the transport of materials, such as I have mentioned. It may be that a collier has to travel in ballast and is not suitable for the transport of other materials. In view of the extreme shortage of shipping, the matter should be investigated by the Minister for Supply and Snipping( Mr Victoria. It is in the very heart Beasley). The Department of the Interior is engaging in a good deal of construction in New South Wales, including the Sydney graving dock, to which references were made by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), as well as works at various camps. Supplies of galvanized iron for civil purposes are acutely short throughout Australia. Under the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, certain buildings have to be erected for the storage of primary products and this work is being hindered by the acute shortage of galvanized iron. I ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to note that considerable quantities of galvanized iron and fencing material are accumulating in New South Wales because transport difficulties prevent other States from obtaining them. Therefore, additional releases might be -made to that State, and its quota could be reduced when the transport position enabled other States to obtain larger quantities. This would do a great deal to improve the position of primary production in New South Wales, and would make use of material which is now lying idle in the sheds of manufacturers. Earlier, some remarks were directed to the Chair in regard to the use of wheat for the production of power alcohol. The Government has undertaken that the wheat-growers will not suffer loss by reason of the fact that wheat is supplied to power alcohol factories at a concession rate. I emphasize that point.

Although it raised most serious questions, it has been replied to only by the Minister for Munitions ( Mr Makin) and a junior Minister. Last Curtin), by way of personal explanation, referred to an agreement between the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Adelaide, the Central Methodist Mission and the Workers' Weekly Herald for the sharing of broadcasting time. The right honourable gentleman tendered, and it is recorded in Hansard, an agreement dated the 17th May, 1943, between the Archbishop, the head of the Central Methodist Mission, and Mr Richards, M.P., on behalf of the Workers' Weekly Herald. Here is a curious thing: That agreement was dated the 17th May, 1943, which I had referred-the agreement of sale-wa s dated the 5th February, 1943. The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr said that that was the agreement with Guy) had asked the Prime Minister the following question:Isi t a fact that the Government reallocated a South Australian broadcasting licence where the Labour party has a f if t h share and free broadcasting time? TheP r i m e Minister repliedYes, except that the agreement between shareholders of the licensee company made no provision for free broadcasting time to the Australian Labour party, although this agreement quoted conditions of free broadcasting time for churches, including others than the church which held four-fifths of the shares in the company. I did challenge that, favourably to the Prime Minister really, by saying that he had clearly been misinformed, because the agreement of sale of this station dated the 5th February expressly provided, in clause 20, that there should be free broadcasting time for the Australia Labour party. Last Thursday, the Prime Minister obtained leave to make a personal explanation. I remind honourable members of what he said in the course of his explanation. I shall read the relevant portions of itThe only agreement of which the Government had knowledge was an agreement which had been entered into by the Central Methodist Mission with His Grace, the Archbishop of Adelaide, and the Honourable Robert Stanley Richards, M.P. I askedWhat was the date of that agreement? TheP r i m e Minister repliedThe 17th May, 1943. L a t e r on the P r i m e M in is t e r s a i d That is the only agreement of which the formed the basis of my answer to the honourable member for Wilmot. Later again he saidI found that it was in conformity with the text of the only agreement of which the Postmaster-General's Department had knowledge. Following a question which I asked the right honourable gentleman across the table, he saidThe agreement from which the right honourable gentleman read yesterday would appear to be one with which the Department of the Postmaster-General had nothing to do. whereas the agreement to It is quite true that the agreement from which I had read was the vital agreement of sale, but the Prime Minister which the Postmaster-General's Department had had nothing to do. Then later on, so that there could be no ambiguity, the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) opened the door for the Prime Minister by askingDoes not the Prime Minister admit that the information which he gave was erroneous although he did not know that at the time? The Prime Minister again mentioned the agreement of the 17th May and,",40,Frederick Stewart No T All Of Government Side Have Clerical Assistance

That was the fourth time, that the Prime Minister had stated that this was the only agreement of which the department had knowledge. A t that stage I made an interjection, disorderly though it may have been gentleman is becoming somewhat disorderly. I shall read my interjection so that the honourable appreciate the f u l l beauty of it . I saidWe do not want to have any unnecessary confusion. I take it that the right honourable gentleman agrees that had he had before him the agreement from which I.read yesterday, his answer would have been different. The Prime Minister repliedThat document related to a transaction which was outside the terms of the agreement of which the Postmaster-General had knowledge. That was the fifth reference to the agreement and the department's lack of knowledge of it . In reminding honourable members of the famous occasion when Alice mentioned that when a thing was said three times it must be true, I consider I am thoroughly entitled to say that as the Prime Minister had said five times that the Department had no knowledge of this agreement it must be true. What are the facts? I regret to say that I must find the Prime Minister guilty of having made a most disingenuous reply. As a matter of fact he said to the HouseNeither wittingly nor unwittingly have I misled either the honourable member for Wilmot or the House. I have read the answer that was given to the question of the honourable member for Wilmot and I ask again: What are the facts? I mention, first, that the agreement of February, from which I quoted last Wednesday, expressly provided, in clause 20, that the Workers' Weekly Herald, on behalf of the Australian Labour party, was to be entitled to broadcast over the air through 5 KA and 5ATJ free of charge for certain periods of time. Oddly enough, the agreement of February containing that provision, is actually referred to in the agreement tabled by the Prime Minister because the agreement of the 17th May, 1943, contains this recitalIn contemplation of the renewal by the Postmaster-General of the broadcasting licences for 5KA and 5AU and in further contemplation of the completion I ask honourable members to mark that word; it had already been executedof the completion of a certain agreement whereby Adelaide Central Methodist Mission and the Workers' Weekly Herald became the T h a t may be so, but legal owners of the shares (except one) in the companies to which the said licences were member for Bass may hitherto issued I say, therefore, that the agreement to which I was referring, of which, according to the Prime Minister, the Postmaster-General's Department knew nothing, was actually referred to in the agreement tabled by the Prime Minister. I pause here for a moment to point out that the honourable member for Fawkner( MrH o l t ) asked for the production of the file dealing w i th this matter, and just before dinner I had the privilege of reading from the file so produced. I regret that I have not the file before me. I was informed that the Postmaster General himself might require it in the Senate. I cannot produce the file but, by the courtesy of the Ministerf or Information , I was permitted to make certain extracts from it . I shall submit Postmaster-General's these to the committee.

Both the Minister for Munitions ( Mr Makin) in this House, and Mr R. S. Richards, of South Australia, in the press, have offered an interpretation of these facts. My friend, the Minister for Munitions, was, I thought, a little concerned to suggest that I was accusing the Central Methodist Mission of something. gentleman did so. Central Methodist Mission behaved with very great simplicity in this matter, and if I were in its place I should want a royal commission.

I am delighted to find this delicate interest in fine shades of language. If anybody in this place wants to know what I think of a bargain under which the Australian Labour party, which has licences to give or refuse, gets for nothing some thousands of pounds of money's worth, then, of course, I say that it is a corrupt deal; and, if I may borrow the expression from the Prime Minister, I make no bones about it. gentleman specifically accused the Methodist Church of being corrupt.

This is Mr Richards's storyI was informed, when I asked for an option, that none would he given to a political party, but that I could take a personal option. I ask honourable members to notice that, but not to judge it yet. He then saidThe Central Methodist Mission was prepared to agree to the conditions I had laid down I , Richards, the holder of the optionfor the transfer of my option.

Nobody pretends that tie physical assets of 5KA. and 5ATJ were worth £8,500 without a licence. The whole usefulness of the option, if there were an option, depended therefore upon securing a licence, and the securing of a licence was a matter entirely within the grant or refusal of a Labour administration.

So having had his endorsement, I repeat my statement: The whole usefulness of the option depended upon securing a licence, and the securing of a licence was a matter within the grant or refusal of a Labour administration. That makes the condition of the payment of £2,400 on behalf of, or for the benefit of, the Australian Labour party very significant. It is not suggested that, in the case of 2HT) Newcastle, any option had been given to anybody. There is no question here of the Honourable R. S.

I ask, was it just a shrewd guess on the part of Mr Alderman, or did he have some concrete ground for his belief? We discussed this matter here last week, and the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) was put up to answer the case that was then made. Speaking for the Government he put out what could be described only as a smoke-screen. He became somewhat impassioned on the subject of station 3XY, in Victoria, and he was delighted because he found on the note-paper of the Young Nationalist Organization of Victoria of that time such distinguished; names as those of Mr Spicer and Mr Holt my name, and also the name of the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson,). He was delighted. He said, "" Here you have a government giving a licence ""-the giving of the licence was, in his opinion, very sinister"" to the Young Nationalist Organization of Victoria "". ber should be careful lest he involve some of his friends in the Macquarie the Macquarie network that I know of, but one never knows in times like these what may happen.

And yet they gave to the Labour party a broadcasting station on exactly the same terms as those on which Mr Lyons gave one to the Young Nationalists! not turn down the returned soldiers in order to give it to the Labour party. to be able to bring in a side-issue. I thought the suggestion was that there was something crooked about giving a licence to the Young Nationalist Organization. hardly deny that if it was "" crooked "" to do .that, it was equally "" crooked "" to give a licence to the Labour party, and, yet, the Labour party was given one. I turn to a matter vividly within my own memory. The licence for 6KLY Perth, a Labour station, was granted to a company called the People's Printing Company, with which, if I remember correctly, the Prime Minister was honorably associated for a number of years. I cannot go into the technical details, but, broadly, the company's application for a licence came before the Government of which I was the head. only application. trary, there were plenty of applications, and my Government, after deliberate consideration of the matter, granted the licence for 6KY to the People's Printing Company because we believed, as I still believe, that the Labour party is entitled to an effective voice on the air. Doesi t not seem a little ungracious that one who was in the most direct sense responsible for giving to the Labour party its Western Australian station should be accused gentleman probably thought that would win his party a few votes in Western Australia. of motives are imputed to anything that I did. Everything I did was "" crooked "". When I gave the Labour party a broadcasting licence in Western Australia it was "" crooked"", and when Mr Lyons gave the Young Nationalist Organization in Vicioria a licence it was "" crooked "". These silly words cut no ice. The fact is that the political parties on both sides have realized that it is a good thing that over the air the people should have the opportunity to hear both sides. That was denied by this Government in connection with the recent referendum. It has never been denied by us. But I have referred to it merely to put it to one side. There are the facts; no one can dispute them. We come back to these transactions at Adelaide and Newcastle, and I put once The Government will more my two questions: What was the money to be given to the Lahour party for? Why was it that Mr Alderman, the negotiator, was able to say to the Bishop of Newcastle, "" If you pay it, your chances are more than good, but if you do not pay it, your chances are not worth discussing""?

I feel that they concern me as a man as well as the Prime Minister responsible to this Parliament and the country. I entered this Parliament some years before the Leader of the Opposition did, and I went out. I came back again on the same day as he made his entry.

280,Mr Curtin (Fremantle,"Primeto peruse, had found in it an intimation that the Postmaster-General (Senator Ashley) informed the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, after consultation with me and the Treasurer ( Mr the Leader of the Opposition of staging Chifley), that this licence in Adelaide was to be issued. The implications of the right honourable gentleman's statements bear dreadfully upon myself. I say that to the right honourable gentleman quite frankly. If his remarks are to be construed as making any charge of improper conduct on my part for any consideration of any sort or kind, let him now say so, and, if he says so, I shall not to the facts, and the honourable member appear in this Parliament until I have been vindicated. Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) has taken an unusual course. Instead of answering a series of questions put to this committee, he has inferred a series of innuendoes by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies). To-day is not the first occasion on which this matter has been discussed in this chamber. It was first discussed on a formal motion for the adjournment of the House, and, on that occasion, the Leader of the Opposition and other honourable members on this side put forward facts that had come into their possession which, in their view, called for some full explanation by the Government or, if the Government were not prepared to give that explanation, some inquiry by an appropriate and independent tribunal. That was the specific request made at that time. The Leader of the Opposition made no suggestion against any individual member of this Parliament or any other Parliament. He told the House that there were facts which had become public and which called for the fullest explanation or, alternatively, the fullest inquiry. The request for an inquiry was refused, and the Prime Minister did not even take part in the debate. In fact, the debate was incomplete, not only because the Prime Minister took no part in it, but also because time for the discussion was limited and when we sought to have it extended the extension was refused. had already been wasted. to decide. After examining the facts which have come before the committee to-night, the public will not be put off by the display given by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister accused an act, but nothing could surpass the act that he himself put on. His attitude will not satisfy the country. He failed to answer one question put to him. charges; we are asking questions. is entitled to his own interpretation. The facts that were presented on the last occasion have been added to by revelations made in the departmental files, which the Government, to its credit, freely made available for our inspection. I shall not attempt to cover the ground covered so brilliantly by the Leader of the Opposition; but as the right honourable gentleman spent most of his time in discussing the Adelaide arrangements, it may be useful if I add something to the information before the committee relating to the Newcastle negotiations. It was pointed out when we debated this matter first that there had been little criticism in Adelaide of what had taken place there. That is one statement which we can properly question. On the latest information we have, there was a good deal of criticism in Adelaide of what, happened there. It is one thing to have an isolated occurrence in which an Adelaide lawyer, dealing with the assets of a client, negotiates with certain parties in Adelaide, but when you find that precisely the same arrangements have been sought to be made by the same representative in another State it is more than a coincidence. I consider that, in order that honourable members may have the fullest information, they should look as far as they can into the minds of the parties involved in these transactions, and I think that I should place on record some of the correspondence contained in the files relating to the Newcastle negotiations. The first is a letter from the Bishop of Newcastle, Dr. Batty, to the Postmaster General, dated the 14th February, 1944The whole Btory of our negotiations for acquisition of the 2HD licence has been frankly a puzzling one.

He concludedWe subsequently had the assets of the 2HD company valued and on the basis of that valuation made an offer for their purchase, which Mr Alderman's principals were unable to accept. When the Postmaster-General expressed regret at the use of the phrase "" a corruptive transaction"", the bishop wrotefor regret in my comments on the proposals originally made to us in connection with the purchase of the 2HD assets. As you will see if you read my letter, there was absolutely no suggestion that you were personally concerned with those proposals. The fact, however, remains that we were given to understand that, if we would make to the Labour party concessions valued at some thousands of pounds, the allocation of the licence to us would be virtually guaranteed. That this I am adding to the correproposal had all the appearance of "" a corrupt transaction "" is not my opinion only, hut also that of all those with whom I have had occasion to discuss the matter. The next link in the chain of correspondence is a letter from a firm of solicitors, W. C. Taylor and Scott, of Sydney. Dated the 9 th August, it was addressed to the Postmaster^General. I understand that the Mr W. 0. Taylor referred to is vice-president of the Australian Labour party. He is also a member of the 'Commonwealth Bank Board. As the correspondence indicates, he was acting as solicitor on behalf of the Australian Labour party. He We act for Air Sales Proprietary Limited, which formerly conducted a commercial broadcasting station at Newcastle known as station 2HD. We understand that the licence was revoked some time ago for certain reasons, but we now wish to apply on behalf of the company for a new licence to be granted. The whole of the issued capital of the company, amounting to 5,107 £1 shares, with the exception of one share, has nowbeen acquired and is held by Messrs. John Stewart, William Olarke Taylor, Charles Benton Scott, and William Edward Dickson, as trustees for the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Labour party. The remaining one share is held by a deceased shareholder. Mr Taylor then stated that he proposed But without the sinister to purchase that share from the administrator of the estate, and sought an early reply to the application. Honourable members are aware that the mere purchase of the physical assets in the form of broadcasting equipment does not of itself confer any right to the licence.

I am endeavouring to add a little information to the facts given by the right honourable gentleman. If we dismiss the histrionics of the Prime Minister, realize our responsibilities and have regard to the standards of public conduct which are proper and desirable in this country, there can be only one answer to our request for the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into these allegations. When the Leader of the Opposition was concluding his speech on this subject last week, he declared that the case for a royal commission was unanswerable. attempt was made to answer that case, the additional facts which have been given this evening will make it imperative for the Government to hold a fulldress inquiry. I do not believe that the Prime Minister can ""get away with it "" by adopting the manly attitude of shouldering the entire responsibility. In his first speech, the Leader of the Opposition suggested alternatives, and it is not for us to give the answers to them. We are not able to get possession of the facts, as a royal commissioner can by calling witnesses. The names of Mr Augusta, and the proposed sale of 2HD Alderman, the Postmaster-General, the Prime Minister and other Ministers have been mentioned in this debate, and in their interests the Government should consent to a f u ll inquiry. Those who have nothing to conceal have nothing to lose. If they have nothing to conceal, what possible reason can they have for objecting to an inquiry? The public, with the facts now before it, will not be satisfied with a brutal caucus vote in this chamber on an issue of this kind. The people will insist that, regardless of party strengths, these charges shall be answered. Their desires will not be met by a party vote in this chamber. The Prime Minister, in his emotional statement, did not say whether he proposed to appoint a royal commission. any charges? operate with the Prime Minister in drafting the terms of the commission. opposite did in the matter of ""the Brisbane line "". says about "" the Brisbane line "" inquiry, the better it will be for his own reputation. He ran away from that. He availed himself of the technical plea of .parliamentary privilege, when the House had waived that privilege by agreeing to the appointment of a royal commission and the terms of reference. We have not forgotten that episode. The people will be just as anxious for a thorough investigation as we are-and as the Government will be too when it realizes the public reaction to the whole transaction. The facts must be made patently clear and Whatever this can be done only by inquiry by an independent body, free from party bias and having no political axe to grind.

309,Mr Calwell (Melbourne,"Ministe rhonorable men, whose reputations are as high in the community as those of any honourable members, and higher than those of some honourable gentleman opposite. The Leader of the Opposition said last weekI t is quite clear that these transactions must be investigated. On the face of them, they are quite capable and reasonably capable of being regarded as utterly corrupt. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) then asked, "" I s that an imputation against the' Methodist Church?"" The Leader of the Opposition repliedThat is an imputation against everybody concerned with the corruption. That is an unequivocal and despicable charge to level against men like the Reverend Samuel Forsyth and the Reverend George White, who engaged in these transactions on behalf of the Methodist Church of South Australia, and the Honourable R. S. Richards, a former Premier of South Australia and the present Leader of the State Opposition, who acted for the Labour party of South Australia. Those persons signed the agreement which the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) tabled last week. Other distinguished persons involved were the Anglican Bishop of Adelaide and the Catholic Archbishop of Adelaide, each from the Central Methodist Mission certain free time on Sunday evenings. Everybody engaged in those transactions is, according to the plain language of the Leader of the Opposition, "" utterly corrupt"" . The right honourable gentleman discussed the subject again this evening because he desired to extricate himself from the difiiculties which he had himself caused. It is for that reason only that he has asked for a royal commission. In reply to his request the Prime Minister has said, "" You lay charges against me, and I will not sit in this House until I have been vindicated "". The Leader of the Opposition has now squibbed the issue again. His junior in the case, the honourable member for Fawkner( MrH o l t ) , the office boy who was also left to deal with "" the Brisbane l in e "" case, is now expected to make good the damage caused by his leader. That honourable member has repeated, parrot-like, the request for a royal commission. I say to honourable members as I said last week, that these transactions have been investigated twice by the Broadcasting Committee, on which at least four members of the Opposition have always sat. That committee did not report against the transactions, and, so far as the evidence shows, it did not on any occasion see anything in them that even suggested corruption or dishonesty. mittee ? of the committee which investigated the subject on the first occasion on the 28th June, 1943. There were present at the meeting, myself as chairman, Senator Amour, Senator Cooper, Senator Herbert Hays, Mr Barnard and D r . Price. Senator Cooper is a member of the Country party, Senator Herbert Hays is a member of the United Australia party, and Dr. Price, who was, at that time, the member for Boothby, and a member of the Opposition. MrH . D . Alderman had been dealing with the case in South Australia and the committee intimated that it desired the whole matter investigated. Mr Alderman wrote to the committee, but we informed him that we would like him to appear before us personally so that he could be cross-examined. of whom agreed to accept In his letter he stated in regard to the sale of station 5ELAThe sale of the shares in the company which owns the station has proceeded to the point where there is an agreement in writing which awaits only the Minister's approval in order to enable the transaction to be completed. The owners of the shares (who are Jehovah's Witnesses) left the matter almost entirely to me. I have always held the opinion that the Labour party should have a voice on the air in each State. My clients allowed me to give play to that view. Out of deference to. and to an extent, in agreement with, the views of the Gibson report, I felt that religious influences should be substantial or predominate. [ therefore, rejected offers by newspapers and others, until I was able to bring about a set-up "" which agreed with the tenor of the Gibson report, modified by my own personal views. The agreement does represent my views. The fact that the Church of England and the Catholic Church are to have specified times represents, I understand, the Minister's interpretation or exegesis of the Gibson report. Unaided by the Gibson report, I would have thought that commercial interests, wit h a religious influence, would be most likely to make a success of a station, but I do not place my opinion above that of the much better informed opinion of the Gibson committee.",52,Spender Ho W Much Did He Time I T Was £17 500 Which Divided By

I might .interpolate here that the present Postmaster-General (Senator Ashley) has endeavoured to adhere to the principles enunciated in the Gibson report in connection with the re-allocation of all broadcasting licences. Mr Alderman appeared before the committee on the 20th June, 1944, and gave evidence on the subjects at issue.

At any rate, no thing dishonest or corrupt had been done. Accusations of that description have been made only in the last few days, when the Leader of the Opposition has been trying to make some political capital out of certain charges that originated with the Bishop of Newcastle and were taken up by some newspapers. It has been left to the foetid imagination of the Leader of the Opposition to suggest corruption, to impute dishonesty, and to scream scandal, where there has been no corruption, no dishonesty, and no scandal.

321,Actions Have Been Improper. Mr Alder,"it. The fact is that the bishop had a mistaken idea about the whole subject. He believed that he had the right to a licence without charge, but no free licences are now available. The position is different now from what it was when the licence for 2CH was granted to the Council of Churches in Sydney and that for station 2SM was granted to the Catholic Church. The New South Wales Council of Churches was an alert and progressive body, which realized the value of a broadcasting licence, and so was the Catholic Church. England in New South Wales did not realize the value of a licence until all the available licences had been secured by newspapers. When the licence for 2HD was suspended the Bishop of Newcastle believed that the Postmaster-General could have allocated it to him without charge and that he could have then negotiated for the purchase of the assets. That idea might have been all right if the High Court had upheld the validity of the National Security regulations in regard to subversive organizations, under which Jehovah's Witnesses were suppressed, but the High Court, at the instance of Mr Alderman, declared those regulations invalid and the Government was thereupon obliged to restore to Jehovah's Witnesses the property that had been confiscated. It was morally obliged to return the wireless broadcasting licence to the company owned by that body, and to whoever bought the shares in the company. The Bishop did not want to buy the shares. He wanted a new licence, his purpose being to negotiate for the shares if he obtained it. If such a policy, which involves repudiation, is to be brought into effect, either this Government or any other government could revoke all the existing licences and re-issue them to whomever it liked. Regulation 9 of the Wireless Telegraphy Regulations provides,A licence shall be granted for such period, not exceeding one year, as the Minister determines. Regulation' 17 providesThe Minister may, by notice in writing, ( Mr Holt). I suppressed nothing. The suspend for such period as is specified in the notice, or revoke, any licence on the ground Leader of the Opposition has admitted, that(a) the licensee has failed to comply with any provision of the act or these regulations, or of any condition of the licence; or (6) he considers it advisable in the public interest to do so. honourable gentleman say that anybody has the right to sell a licence? the selling of a licence, but referred only to the sale of the shares in the company which owned the licence. No licensee has a prescriptive right to any frequency. The Church of A licence can be cancelled at any time; and in any event it is not current for longer than a year.' property in a licence. gentleman may put it as he likes. There is such a thing as the equitable treatment of those who hold licences. This Government decided to allow Jehovah's Witnesses to sell their equity to any one who would purchase it from them. Not at any time did it intend to force them to make a sale to somebody whom either the Government or Opposition members do or do not like. The second great weakness in the case put up in connection with the negotiations between Mr Richardsand Mr Alderman about the option which Mr Richards held, is that the Leader of the Opposition has forgotten the date on which Mr Richards took his option. It was the 9th January, 1941, at which time the Labour party was not in power. The grant, of a licence was within the gift of a government in which the present Leader of the Opposition was Prime Minister and Senator McLeay was the Postmaster General. So that, in the fantastic story conjured up to-day by the Leader of the Opposition, his own Government becomes particeps criminis. Opposition has quoted from the files. That is more than the Minister is prepared to do. from the file last week, but also made it available to the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Eawkner not only that I made the files available",54,Spender Ho W Much Did He Time I T Was £17 500 Which Divided By

We do not agree that a royal commission should inquire into baseless charges, or embark on a muck-raking escapade to help honourable gentlemen opposite to rehabilitate their fallen political fortunes. know what was on the file. Even the Prime Minister said that the February agreement was not on the file. things to the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison). He makes wild statements, and his hyperbolical language 13 not matched by that of any other honourable member. When the Prime Minister said that if the Opposition would lay charges he would adopt a certain course, the honourable member for Wentworth and his leader were immediately deflated, and they have not since opened their mouths on that aspect of the matter. I could tell an interesting story of all the broadcasting licences that have been issued to date. I related last week the circumstances in connection with the issue of a licence to station 3XY. I then made the charge, which has not been refuted, that that station was promised to the returned soldiers of Victoria, and that a United Australia party government stole the licence from them and gave it to its friends. That is true. There was very considerable protest from the leaders of the returned soldiers at the time. If honourable gentlemen opposite will closely study the newspaper .file of the period, they will find that what I have said is perfectly true. Last week, I made some references to a licence that had been issued to the Graziers Association. I am now in a position to tell the committee the interesting story that is associated with that episode. If ever it were proposed to nationalize broadcasting stations or anything else, honourable gentlemen opposite would be the first to object, because their friends ""got in on the ground floor"" when wireless licences were being issued, and still hold the majority of the stations. The story in relation to the granting of a licence to the Graziers Association of New South Wales is an interesting one. On the 23rd January, 1933, while Sir Archdale Parkhill was Postmaster-'General, the Postal Department informed Mr R. G. Lamb, c/o Noble Douglass and Company, 18 Martin-place, Sydney, that it wasprepared to authorize a power of 2,000 aerial watts for a broadcasting station to be erected at Meadow Flat, near Bathurst. On the 14th February, 1933, a company to be known as 2LE Radio Corporation Limited was to be formed,, with a capital of 20,000 shares at £1 each. On the 9th January, 1934, the department was informed that the South British National Trust Limited was financing the 2LE project. On the 9th August, 1934, the Sydney Morning Herald indicated that a royal commission was to be appointed by the New South Wales Government to inquire concerning the activities of investment companies owned by the McArthur group that were operating in New South Wales, and the South British National Trust Limited was mentioned as one of the companies. When I made my charge last week, the Leader of the Opposition, in his elegant phraseology, shouted "" Liar "". The facts, of course, refute him. On the 8th November, 1934. the Postmaster-General's Department informed the 2LE Radio Corporation of the withdrawal of its letter of approval for the grant of a licence. The Public Trustee, who had been appointed to look after the interests of the unfortunate people who had been fleeced by the McArthur group of scoundrels and to administer the affairs of the British National Trust Limited and the other companies concerned, desired that the offer of the department to grant a licence to 2LE should stand, in order to conserve some return for a large number of shareholders who had suffered financially. The Graziers Association then came into the picture. It had been pressing since September, 1932, for a licence for a station near Bathurst. It had been suggested in October, 1932, that the association might get in touch with this group of scoundrels, the 2LE Radio Corporation, for the purpose of coming to a joint arrangement whereby it would have a share in the proposed station. These negotiations took place in 1934, but consequent upon the royal commission and -the withdrawal of",55,Spender Ho W Much Did He Time I T Was £17 500 Which Divided By

329,Mr Calwell,"Facts are strangethe approval to grant a licence to the 2LE Radio Corporation, the department informed the Graziers Association on the 8th February, 1935,"" that it would grant a licence to the association for the Orange the position further. The Opposition has district, on the understanding that a share in the s.tation would be granted to the Public Trustee. On the 16th April, 1935, a licence was granted under the title 2GZ, to the Country Broadcasting Service Limited, for a station at Orange. The Public Trustee of ""New South ""Wales was granted 1,500 £1 deferred shares. The capital of this company was 50,000 £1 stares, divided into 48,500 £1 ordinary and 1,500 £1 deferred shares. So far as can be ascertained, no other broadcasting licence issued was implicated in the 2LE case. The licence should have been issued to the Public Trustee, and should not have been given to the Graziers Association on the condition that it gave 1,500 of its 50,000 shares to the representative of the people who had beenfleecedwhen they had put their money in the company which originally had been given the licence. If ever there has been a scandal in connection with the issue of a broadcasting licence, it was associated with the issue of the licence to 2GZ. That licence was issued on the 8th November, 1934, by Senator the Honourable A. J. McLachlan as Postmaster-General in the anti-Labour government of that day. The story of 2HD and SKA has now been told several times. The Leader of the Opposition has been motivated by the greatest desire to cover up the charges which he made last Thursday. He has tried to extricate himself from the outrageous attacks which he made on the leaders of several religious organizations. Be has again demonstrated his unfitness for political leadership in this country. He has blundered egregiously by his gratuitous insults to decent, honourable people, and thus has prevented the rebuilding of his party. To-day, he has made fresh charges in the hope that his first insults will be forgotten. Neither his first ing Committee was made aware of the nor his last insults will be forgotten. His charges are without foundation, his accusations are baseless. There is not the slightest justification for a royal compaying anything for it. Evidently the mission or any other form of inquiry. Opportunities for the fullest inquiry have been available to the BroadcastingCommittee. Opportunities will be offered in the future to the members of that committee, if they so desire, to investigate four representatives on the committee. This latest activity of a so-called ""fighting Opposition"" demonstrates its unfitness ever again to be trusted with the government of this country. Its members do not deserve even the title of "" a fight ing Opposition"". The only title to which they can lay claim is that of "" a mud-slinging Opposition "". matta) [10.13] -Unlik e the Minister( Mr Calwell), who has just completed his speech, I shall not appeal for judgment in this matter to a committee which is strictly bound by the caucus majority. All that the motion asks-and I make no apology for supporting it-is that all the facts shall be submitted to the arbitrament of a royal commission. In recentdays, honourable members opposite have applauded the judgment of certain royal commissions, and have castigated very severely any suggestion from this side which might be interpreted as impugning their integrity or their findings. If that be their view, I cannot understand why they should be so fearful of placing before a royal commission all the facts that have been so clearly placed before this chamber this evening. The Minister shed "" crocodile tears "" about the effect on the reputations of certain church leaders. In refusing to allow these matters to be investigated and finally settled by a judicial tribunal, he is allowing those church leaders to remain under what he regards as a stigma. Is he afraid to trust the reputations of these church leaders to a royal commission? He has in his usual way endeavoured to burke the question, and to answer logic with clamour.' I do not wish to leave this matter to the judgment of the committee, or to remit it to the Broadcasting Committee. I challenge the Minister to state that the Broadcastfact that the South Australian Branch of the Australian Labour party was to get a one-fifth share in the station without Minister does not propose to reply.

330,Sir Frederick Stewart (Parra,"wish I could feel as comfortable over this matter as some of my co-religionists purport to feel. I am not questioning tbe association of tbe Labour party with the Methodist 'Church. As a matter of fact, I believe that the Labour party was born in the Methodist Church, and if it had maintained that association it would have saved itself from a lot of criticism. However, I do question the action of the Methodist Church in making free gifts of this kind to the Labour party. If the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) were in the chamber, I should ask him whether gift duty has been paid on this money. i know the Reverend Samuel Forsyth better than do some of those who have spoken for him to-night, and I do not question his integrity. ber's leader did. I do question the business capacity of the church leaders. It is notorious that doctors and parsons are as manna from heaven to the go-getters. The Minister for Information said that Mr Alderman was acting as trustee for Jehovah's Witnesses, and was bound to see that he made the best sale of their assets. Mr position in the church life of the comAlderman knew that the physical assets of the stations were valueless without a licence. Incidentally, I was amazed to hear repeated to-night the statement made by the Minister for Information last week that when the High Court declared to he invalid the regulations under which Jehovah's Witnesses were deprived of their licence, there was a moral obligation upon the Government to restore their property, including the licence. If that were really so, I want to know why the Government did such an immoral thing as to refrain froni restoring the licence. restore the licence, and permitted it to be sold. There was no provision whatever for the sale of the licence. It is evident that the charges can be made against men and Minister for Information does not even know his brief. Mr Alderman had business acumen enough to know that if he could have offered to the Central Methodist Mission in Adelaide, or to the Diocesan Council in Newcastle, not only the physical assets of the stations concerned, but also the licences, he could have demanded a great deal more than £8,400 for the Adelaide stations and £17,500 for the Newcastle station. This is a matter which, obviously, should be investigated by a royal commission. In his own interests, the Prime Minister should agree to the request for such an inquiry. To-night, the right honourable gentleman treated us to a sorry spectacle. In reply to a question some time ago, he gave an answer which was palpably erroneous. He was given an opportunity to escaj>e by saying that he had been misinformed, but he repeated the statement. To-day, the ground was cut from under his feet by the unrefuted statements of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies). Therefore, in the interests of the Prime Minister himself, this Parliament, and the church leaders concerned, it is imperative that this matter be referred to a royal commission for investigation. for the Navy and Minister for Munitions) [10.23] I am astounded that a gentleman who occupies an honoured munity should be prepared to identify himself with some of the statements that have issued from the Opposition side of the committee, statements which impugn the honour and good name of some of those who stand highest in the Methodist Church. He does himself very little credit by associating himself with such an attack. To-night, he gained a little more courage than he was .able to summon up when this matter, was under discussion last week. Then, when the call came to this side of the chamber, he jumped up in his place as if he were determined to say something, but when the call went to the Opposition side,' he sat tight in his seat. His methods are not overlooked by those who value consistency and straight dealing. Politics have become a wretched thing when such institutions of the highest standing. I know the persons concerned even more intimately than does the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart).

335,Mr Makin (Hindmarsh,"Ministe ryears, and have been associated with them in church activity and in the ordinary life of the community. The Reverend George ""White, the Reverend Samuel Forsyth, and the Honourable R. S. Richards are men of outstanding character, whose honour stands as high as that of any other men in Australia. They would be the last to identify themselves with anything that -was in the slightest degree questionable or irregular. Therefore, it ill-becomes any one who ought to be acquainted in some degree with the fine work of the Central Methodist Mission to attempt to besmirch the names of such men. to clear their names. ber for Parramatta does not desire to clear their names. He only wishes to score a political advantage, and in doing so is prepared to impugn the honour of fine men and to besmirch sacred institutions. It is almost twelve months since this deal was completed and .the licence granted, yet not one word was said on the subject by members of the Opposition until last week. The matter was reviewed by the Broadcasting Committee, on which members of the Opposition sit. If they believed that there was anything irregular in the transaction, and remained silent so long, they failed in their duty. Is it likely that if there was anything sinister or irregular in the transaction every detail regarding it would be recorded on the file for any one to inspect? As a matter of fact, everything connected with the matter can be justified by an inspection of the file itself by the people of that State, partiThere is no charge that anything is missing from the file. The Opposition is even prepared to admit that the agreement which has been criticized is on the file. Everything relating to the deal is there. Mr Richards hit the nail on the head when he said that this outburst of the Opposition was the result of the increasing popularity of station 5KA, and that the party representing the interests of its competitors had heen instructed to try to destroy the good name of a formidable rival. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr political purposes. It is a miserable Menzies) said that he agreed that the voice of Labour should be heard over the air. If his words are worth anything there should be no objection to the voice of the Labour party being thus heard in South Australia. Until this arrangement, the party led by the Premier of South Australia, which is of similar political colour to the Opposition in this Parliament, monopolized broadcasting facilities in South Australia, and the Labour party's voice was unheard. Week after week the Premier of South Australia used station 5AD to enunciate the policy and beliefs of his party, and there was no way in which we could express our view with equal effect. Moreover, the Government party had a virtual monopoly of the press; it has always been felt that the same prominence was rarely, if ever, given in the newspapers to the words of Mr Richards as was given to those of Mr Playford. It was vital that the Labour party, which represents a substantial part of public opinion in South Australia, should have means to make its views known. This actuated Mr Richards to secure an option over the assets of the 5KA and 5AU wireless stations. The arrangement now operating in South Australia, by which the Labour party is able to give expression to its opinions, has the endorsement of all religious thought and the community generally in South Australia, and it is an appropriate arrangement that the various religious communities should share a common interest in this broadcasting enterprise. The extravagant and reckless charges of the Leader of the Opposition supported by the honourable member for Parramatta will be repudiated cularly by the members of the very denomination for which the honourable member for Parramatta professes sympathy and regard. The parties to the agreement are men of integrity, and the deal was honest in every way. The broadcasting committee on which the Opposition is represented and which had the opportunity to review the whole matter neither raised objection to the deal nor questioned the methods adopted in its completion. Therefore, I am justified in saying that this matter had been raised for sordid manoeuvre designed to restore the Opposition to political favour, but I am sure that after the facts of this transaction",58,Spender Ho W Much Did He Time I T Was £17 500 Which Divided By

337,"Mr Makin""","The honourable memhave been placed before the people, there will be indignation that public men should have lent their support to such ungenerous and reckless expressions as have been used by the Leader of the Opposition. -My knowledge of this matter is confined to what I have heard in the debate. I do not associate myself with charges of corCurtin) or the Methodist Church. I see no grounds for suggesting corruption, and, therefore, I make it quite clear that I do not think that it exists. But I do say that there are circumstances of the transactions which call for an investigation. Tbe Government should welcome the suggestion made by a man occupying the responsible position of Leader of the Opposition that there should be investigation of the circumstances. If it has nothing to hide, there should be no reason why it should not agree to an investigation. I have sought to take an impartial view of the matter. I can understand the reaction of any Minister who considers that a charge of corruption has been made against him, because I am used to baseless charges hurled by members of the Government against this side. I have always sought to avoid making charged which cannot be established. Therefore, I approach this matter dispassionately. It is quite wrong that the Methodist Church should be dragged into the discussion. When I heard the speeches of the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) and the Minister for the Navy( Mr Makin) I thought of Christians love one another"". Methodist Church is not involved in this matter, because I have no doubt that before the transaction was completed the church was led to believe that Mr Richards held an option under which he had certain rights. think that that inference can be drawn from the facts revealed in this discussion. I have no doubt that following upon the assurance that there was a preliminary agreement, either written or oral, under which Mr Richards had certain rights, the Labour party was given the interest which it has in station 5KA. That is a very likely construction to place upon the facts, and if it is the correct construcand I do not make charges. I know how tion, the Methodist Church should be dissociated from this discussion. The first question is whether there was an option. That seems to be the very gist of this matter. If there was, I see nothing wrong in the transaction at all. transaction? There was no option there. the South Australian transaction at the moment. There was nothing wrong in the transaction if there was an option. There would be wrong in it only if there were no option or if the option were a sham or illusory, and if some one having final determination of the matter had received money as an inducement to neglect his duty in the interests of a certain political organization or had given preference to the Labour party because of political affiliations. SoI ask whether there was an option. gentleman's statement does not altogether convince me. Three or four times I have heard him say that there was an option away back in January, 1941. I heard the honourable gentleman's defence on behalf of the Government. As one who supports the motion, I say that I could have made a better defence myself. The honourable gentleman did not answer the allegations. 'He evaded the issues. He said that this matter was dealt with by the Broadcasting Committee, but it was not, as I shall show. Instead of trying to answer the charges, the honourable the expression, "" How these gentleman used the subterfuge of making The a counter-allegation, which is no answer. The statement that the Broadcasting Committee dealt with the matter is also no answer at all, for two good reasons. The first is that no member of the committee knew that I Mr Richards claimed to have an option. Secondly, no member knew that under the arrangement the Labour party was to receive an interest of a substantial financial character for no consideration at all. Both facts are obvious. Therefore, it is useless for the honourable gentleman to talk about what took place before the Broadcasting Committee. One gets back to the facts.

342,Mr Spender,"The honorableeasy it is to make charges and how difficult it is to refute them. The facts are: Jehovah's Witnesses were given hack their property and their licence to broadoption, indeed, is based the only case that cast, as the result of a decision of the High Court. honourable member for Barker( Mr no t as a government, but as a political Archie Cameron) that no legal obligation existed for the return of the licence. deal only with the assets, not with the licence. that is so, but morally, once the High -Court gave its decision, it was proper to restore Jehovah's Witnesses to exactly the position they occupied before the actions of the Commonwealth on which the High Court adjudicated. After that judgment Jehovah's Witnesses had the legal right to certain assets and the moral right to the licences. The transactions were carried out in each case to the objective facts I am putting to by Mr Alderman, K . CI do not know how a King's counsel came to be a commercial agent. Australia is different from that in New South Wales. ever, I do not make any comment about that. I shall deal with the facts objectively. Mr Alderman dealt with two properties, one in Adelaide, and the other in Newcastle; and in both instances the terms and conditions were exactly the same. That is my first point. My second point is that in one case his effort was abortive, and in the other it came to fruition. When I find a similaTity of approach in two instances, I seek explanation in the approach in the case that came to fruition, and what do I find? Mr Alderman asserts that when he went to Melbourne he was approached by Mr Richards, who asked by telegram for the first option on station 5KA, as I understand it, on behalf of the Labour party. He said that he would give the first option to the Labour party. It was not, however, until the 21st September, after the statement of Mr Alderman had been made before the Broadcasting Committee, that Mr Richards publicly said: "" I had an option"". When the Leader of the Opposition was speaking, I asked whether he knew what were claimed to be the terms of that option. We are entitled to that information, because from that option sprang the right which the Labour party now has in station 5KA. On that can be made out in favour of granting to I quite agree with the a Labour government, or any government party-somethin g for nothing. That is the crux of the matter. If there was an option, and it was sold, I can see nothing wrong with it ; but if there was no option, there is everything wrong with the transaction. evidence that he gave an option. very often say certain things, but often they have been proved to be wrong. In some cases, probably, their memory was faulty. I make no allegation at all against Mr Alderman; but I say that it is no answer the committee to say what Mr Alderman, or Mr Richards, has said, because it is obvious that those gentlemen are not telling the same story. I am not attempting to judge between them. I want to know from a representative of the Ministryand surely this information can be given now in view of the statement by the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) that there was an option in January, 1941-wha t were the terms of the option? Was it in writing? From whom to whom was it given? And what consideration was given for it? his evidence Government to answer those questions. I shall not be balked by what somebody is alleged to have said. I am trying to deal with the matter objectively. I am not concerned with any political advantage in this matter, but solely with upholding the reputation of this Parliament and the integrity of government, regardless of party. If there he anything wrong with this transaction it does not follow that any individual Minister is responsible for it. I do not approach the matter in that way. Buti f there is anything wrong with it, the facts must be brought to the light of day. If the Government can answer the questions I have just asked I shall not support the motion.

What was the consideration given for it? When did that option come to he exercised, and on whose behalf was it exercised-, and who supplied the money for its exercise? They are fair questions, and if the Government eannot answer them, as it should do so for the benefit of the committee, I say simply that the matter calls for investigation. member agree with the Leader of the Opposition that the Methodist Church is corrupt? Information will not divert me in my approach to this matter. understand the Government refusing to answer the questions, because inherent in the case of the station in Adelaide is petent counsel, said, in substance, that if the fact that the Labour party has received a substantial benefit. The Labour party was in office in this Parliawere not it would not be a good thing. L ment; and there are officials throughout the Administration who support the Labour party, and who would permit this transaction to take place in spite of the advice given by the Solicitor-General, Sir George Knowles. Either the Labour party put up money for its own benefit, c-r it did not. That is the whole point. Therefore, the real issue comes back to the questions I have asked with respect to the option. I say frankly that I have no desire to support the amendment merely because it has been moved by an honourable member on this side. I say simply that the objective facts call for investigation. Should the Government answer adequately and satisfactorily the questions I have asked, I cannot imagine that any honourable member would want an investigation. In any event I would not say that I want a royal commission because, with some knowledge of the the history of royal commissions, I am not always impressed by their labours. A committee of this Parliament properly going about its job should be quite competent to arrive at the facts and report back to the Parliament. knows more about getting his brotherment were he with the Government, bein-law out of internment. in mud-raking with the Minister. This debate has been markedby histrionics and by declamations. Ministers, particularly, have attempted to answer these allegations by all kinds of histrionics. They do not make much impression on me in a matter of this kind. I say again, and, simply, that the Government should give to the committee and the people of this country, the answers to the questions I have asked. Was there an option? Where is the option ? Did any one supply any consideration for the 'benefits that the Labour party received as the result of the granting of this licence? If , in point of fact, the Government cannot answer those questions light is then thrown upon the negotiations in respect of station 2HD Newcastle, because in I cannot that instance Mr Alderman for some reason, which, at some time, he might be given an opportunity to explain to comthe terms were agreed upon in that case it would be "" a good thing "", and if they think that I could ask him a few pertinent questions on that point. I repeat that the Government does not defend itself by making allegations about what took place in 1935. That is an old manoeuvre to which the Minister for Information repeatedly has recourse and it is useless for Ministers, as some are in the habit of doing in order to divert attention from an issue they want to evade to make abusive remarks about honourable members on this side. The issue as I see it, is whether the Government can answer to this committee's satisfaction the questions I have asked. If it cannot, I shall support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. for Transport and Minister for External Territories) [10.55] I shall not claim, like some honourable members opposite, that I have examined the file in this matter; but I have listened attentively to the speeches made so -far in this debate and I am very pleased to learn that the honourable member for 'Warringah ( Mr Spender) is against the Government.

355,Mr Ward (East Sydney,"Ministe roccasion when he sided with the Government it did not do so well. The arguments advanced by honourable members opposite lead me to the conclusion that tbe time has arrived when the Government should consider whether it should not put a stop to trafficking in broadcasting licences by nationalizing the industry. I am amazed at the poor case put up by honourable members opposite, particularly because they entered the contest with such vigour as would lead one to believe that they would establish a case that would warrant some form of inquiry. I am also amazed that the Labour party has acted with such restraint in its efforts in the past to enable the voice of Labour to be heard over the air in this country. The anti-Labour parties, of course, have their special methods of achieving their own objective in that direction. They have their auxiliaries, such as the Graziers Association, to which past governments have granted broadcasting licences, with the result that to-day the great majority of broadcasting stations in this country are controlled by anti-Labour organizations. I believe that the Labour party should long ago have set out on a campaign to obtain broadcast licences in order to enable the voice of Labour to be heard over the air. If the churches have now come to the conclusion, like so many other sections of the community, that the only hope for the country is to keep the Labour party in office, and such bodies want to co-operate with the Labour party in the acquisition of .broadcasting licences, it is all to their broadcasting station in Adelaide, although credit, because it shoAvs that they are approaching the nation's problems in a practical way. However, we might examine the granting of licences in respect of other stations. I mention, for instance, station 2CH Sydney, with which the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) was associated. That licence was granted to the Council of Churches, and the honourable member came to the assistance of that body by helping it to finance the station by the purchase of equipment. Quite recently, acting like many other professing Christians, decided to sell out his interest in that station; and I understand that he sold it to Amalgamated Wireless Australia Limited at a very remunerative figure. Having thus withdrawn his support from the Council of Churches, he immediately became conscience-stricken, and decided to give a farming property to that body. The honourable member, who made insulting 'remarks to me, probably would like a royal commission to be appointed to inquire into the granting of the licence in respect of station 2CH, in order to afford to him the opportunity to state exactly to what degree he provided financial support to the Council of Churches, and how much, he personally derived from that transaction. objection to that station being included' in the terms of reference to a royal commission. member could go back a little further and explain where he got the money to purchase the equipment for that station in the first place. If honourable members opposite really want an investigation of this subject, let it be a thorough investigation. When the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) was speaking, I asked whether he favoured the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into the source of the funds of all political parties, because the charge, if it can be called such, made against this Government is that it played a part in some arrangement whereby the Labour party gained an interest valued at £2,400 in a it had not disbursed one penny in respect of that consideration. No charge has been made that any individual member of the Labour party has gained as the result of that transaction. The charge made is that this consideration amounted to a direct contribution to the funds of the Labour party. Honourable members opposite declare that that is wrong and improper. I have often wondered where anti-Labour parties obtained their funds. If the Opposition wants a royal commission, let us have an inquiry into the sources of all party funds. That the honourable member suggestion does not evoke much enthusiasm among honourable members opposite. They do not want a royal commission into that subject. The honourable member for Fawkner",62,Spender Ho W Much Did He Time I T Was £17 500 Which Divided By

357,Mr Ward,"Perhaps the honorableasked for a royal commission, the terms of which would be decided nth conference between the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Labour party? He had the opportunity Menzies). appointment of the royal commission on "" the Brisbane line "". opposite want to ""cook"" the terms of reference so that the inquiry will be held wrong with that? I see nothing wrong into only those aspects which they want investigated. I welcomed, and would still welcome, an inquiry into the charges that I made regarding "" the Brisbane line"", but honourable members opposite wanted the terms of reference to be so framed as to prevent me from submitting to the royal commissioner the evidence which I possessed. When the report of the royal commission was received, they told the Prime Minister, "" This must not end the case, because the honourable member for East Sydney has avoided giving evidence by claiming parliamentary privilege "". They were going to do all kinds of things, such as demanding the appointment of a parliamentary committee with full powers to examine-all the evidence. What happened? When the report was being dealt with in this House, the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), who had been very vocal until that time, ran away. The only one who was left here was the poor little office boy, the honourable member for Fawkner, who had to put up the best case he could for the Opposition. Those honourable gentlemen now ask for the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into the transaction a brief reference to one particular incirelating to the sale of two broadcasting stations. Many royal commissions have conducted investigations of a variety of matters, and they have proved abortive. They have been a harvest for lawyers. No wonder all the lawyers ask for a royal commission 1 If they want a royal commission now, let us have one that will be of some use. Let us have an inquiry into' the source of all party funds. Then we shall probably get somewhere. I do not know Mr Alderman. I have no recollection of ever having met him. Nor have I had an opportunity to examine the files. But I can see nothing improper in 'the.se dealings. Isi t so amazing that a King's counsel should be sympathetically disposed towards the to conduct negotiations for a transfer of a broadcasting licence, and stipulated, because he desired to help the Labour party, that the Labour movement should get a certain amount of free time and an interest in the station. Is anything with it. that the Labour party got any advantage. Prime Minister denied any such thing. If the Labour party acquired an interest in a broadcasting station, or the right to free time over the air, obviously the transaction is an advantage to the organization, but what is wrong with that? I wish that I had the opportunity to do a little more for the Labour party, and I would make no apology for doing it. The implication contained in the speech of the Leader of the Opposition is that all the people concerned in this transaction were corrupt. This evening, the Leader of the Opposition attempted to escape from the unequivocal statement that he made last week that everybody connected with the deal was corrupt. That included the Central Methodist Mission of Adelaide. There is no doubt in my mind that the Opposition has attempted to make a great deal out of very little. For the benefit of these moralists who talk about the impropriety of the deal in which the Labour party has been involved, I desire to make dent. The Leader of the Opposition, who demanded a royal commission to inquire into these particular transactions, said that it was improper for the Labour party to obtain an interest in a broadcasting station for which it had not paid anything. When the right honourable gentleman was Attorney General in the Lyons Government, he appeared before the Privy Council for the Commonwealth of Australia. For that he was paid as Attorney-General, and his expenses were paid by the Commonwealth Government. Despite that fact, he accepted a fee of 2,000 guineas from the Government of Victoria for",63,Spender Ho W Much Did He Time I T Was £17 500 Which Divided By

It must be obvious to every one that the sole purpose of members of the 'Opposition is to attempt to turn an ordinary business deal into something shady, so that they may derive political advantage from it. Therefore, I support my colleague the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell), who has submitted an unanswerable case-. Before concluding, I repeat that I would welcome an inquiry by a royal commission, not with limited terms of reference, but with power to investigate the sources of all party funds. I have heard that all sorts of commercial interests in this country support political parties. ""Wby do they do so? For favours to he done after the party is returned to office! I have long been interested to know the source of party funds and what strings are attached to them. Therefore, if honourable members opposite want a royal commission, let the terms of reference be as wide as possible. 111.5] -The Minister for Information man, KC., of Adelaide, gave evidence before the Parliamentary Broadcasting Committee, and therefore, that cleared up the case. I differ from the view expressed by the Minister, and I believe that Mr Alderman would be one of the first to admit that his statement on this matter would not necessarily clear up the case from the standpoint of either the Government, or the Opposition. According to the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Guy), Mr Alderman was not called before the committee to give evidence on this transaction, but he referred to it when he was discussing another proposal that was being investigated by the committee in Tasmania. about the deal for 25 minutes, and covered every detail. The honourable member for Wilmot could have questioned him, but he remained silent. Minister was good enough to lend me the evidence a few days ago, and having read it carefully, I contend that Mr they should be allowed to broadcast in the [51] Alderman's statement to the Broadcasting Committee does not settle the matter. Mr Alderman did not intend his remarks to settle it. In his evidence given to the Broadcasting Committee, several matters were mentioned. The Minister referred also to the sale of commercial broadcasting licences. I have occupied the position of Postmaster-General and on one occasion I issued a licence to the Labour party's station, 2KY. One of the first things that a Postmaster-General must learn is that the licences are the property of the Commonwealth. They are never sold by the Commonwealth. no prescriptive right to a frequency. point is that the licence is always the property of the Commonwealth, and cannot be trafficked in. I well remember that in the few months when I was Postmaster-General, a person in New South Wales, who had secured a broadcasting licence, did not desire to erect a station and wanted to sell the licence. I refused to allow the sale, and put him in' the position of either erecting the station in conformity with the undertaking that he gave when the licence was issued, or returning the 'licence to the Commonwealth. That point is important in this discussion. The actual facts, if investigated, will prove that this matter was before the High Court for some time. During that period, a change of Government took place. While the matter was sub judice, it was not proper for the previous Government to issue the licence to any one else, or to compel the holders of it to dispose of their assets. The station was closed at the instigation of one of the armed services, because of the subject-matter that was being broadcast. I have some knowledge of that. When the matter of the reissue of this licence aroseI use deliberately the word "" re-issue""-it was obvious that notwithstanding the judgment of the High Court the services would take a deep interest in any move to give the licence to the previous holders. Whilst the High Court may have declared that those people had been wrongly dealt with by the previous Government, it never at any stage of the proceedings declared that",64,Spender Ho W Much Did He Time I T Was £17 500 Which Divided By

The property belonged to them and they were entitled to it, but the licence was Commonwealth property and the Commonwealth could dispose of it in any way it chose. Having clarified that point, I come to the questions that the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) raised. I know intimately some of the people whose names have been mentioned in this debate. Mr Alderman is a fairly close friend of mine. The Reverend Samuel ForsythI know moderately well. No man in South Australia in his calling has done more in the last fifteen years, according to his lights, than he has. That point is clear. the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr the facts should be revealed. The way Menzies). these matters, the Minister should be more restrained. If he will carefully study the passages that he read from Hansard to-night, he will see that the Leader .of the Opposition applied his reship. marks about corruption to those who were guilty of it. He did not say who they were. Obviously, he could not know who they were, for the simple reason that the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr at that stage he was asking for an impartial inquiry to determine whether there had been any corruption, and, if so, who had been guilty of it. This matter cannot be settled in the way that the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) chose. I say, with great respect to his high office, that he cannot adopt the attitude of the injured innocent and regard that as the end of the story. This is not a question of whether the Prime Minister issued this licence or whether he was guilty of something. Regardless of who happens to be Prime Minister, this matter affects the very heart of public administration in this country. As one who for a short time occupied the position of Postmaster General and handled the matter of broadcasting licences, I do not care a hang how wide the Government makes the terms of reference, or how many years the inquiry goes back. If anything wrong that is done, I fear that the Government has been done in -public administration, the man responsible, irrespective of his party, is not entitled to any protection. this country that the transaction has These matters cannot be glossed over by effective speechmaking by Ministers. No matter how vehement or excited Ministers become, these are ghosts that walk, and there is only one way in which to deal with them. Mr .SPENDER -B y laying them ! The Government must appoint a proper tribunal to inquire into every detail of these transactions. Strange as it may seem, I am for once in agreement with the Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward). Nevertheless I have had the feeling upon more than one occasion that royal commissions have not carried out their real functions. There has been too much of a tendency, after their appointment, to contrive that certain facts did not come to light, rather than to ensure that all in which they proceed to work does not appeal to me at all. ber could not say that of the royal commission which inquired into the censorsaid nothing about that commission, but some day I may do so, in which case Pollard) no doubt will, even if a little late, come into his own. Some royal commissioners seem to think that they siton a mountain, and that everybody has to labour up and bow before them when they are asked to make an inquiry. Such an attitude does not suit my book at allI f they accept a commission, they should satisfy their minds as to what is wrong, not adopt the customary attitude of aloofness and inaccessibility. Legal gentlemen are appointed to assist the commissioners, and on occasions I very much doubt whether these persons are of any assistance at all in the conduct of an inquiry. So far as I am concerned, the Government can make the investigation into this case as wide as it likes, and as retrospective as it likes. It will not worry me. There is evidently something in the case which requires clearing up. Ii: should be explained and clarified.

372,Mr Archie Cameron,"I havestatements which have been attributed to a bishop of the Anglican Church in correspondence with the Postmaster General have been read in this chamber, and require clearing up. I warn the Minister for Information that it is usually a little difficult to get away from anything when the name of a bishop is attached to it. There again everything points to the necessity for a thoroughgoing investigation of these transactions. If it involves going back into other wireless transactions, let that be done. If it causes the cancellation of certain licences which have 'been granted, in order that justice may be done, let that position be faced also. I am surprised and disgusted at the attitude adopted by members of the Opposition upon this issue. It is amazing that, although there is and has been for the last twelve months a broadcasting committee, including Opposition members such as Senator Herbert Hays, the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr General agreed, permission to transfer Bowden), the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis), and the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Guy), which has met on many occasions during the life of this Parliament, not once has a member from either side expressed doubt of the legality of the agreement in relation to station 5KA Adelaide. The attempts made to-night by members of the Opposition to separate the Labour party from the religious organizations which are linked up with 5KA have also been astonishing. There is no doubt that in last Thursday's debate, members of the opposition linked together all the persons and bodies associated with the agreement, including the Central Methodist Mission, the Archbishop of Adelaide, the Bishop of Adelaide, Mr Richards, M.L.A., and the Worker's Weekly Herald, but to-night the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr the press of that State or over the air. Menzies), apparently recognizing that he had made a grave error so far as his own party was concerned, has attempted in the amendment which he has moved to confine his charges to the Australian Labour party, and to withdraw the accusations against the Central Methodist Mission and the other religious denominations. feature of to-night's debate is that members of the Opposition are inclined to omit station 5KA from their arguments, and to enlarge upon the Newcastle station 2HD. I agree with the Minister for Munitions ( Mr Makin) that it is only right and proper for the Labour party in South Australia to have a voice over the air. I have yet to hear any specific charge of dishonesty made by memlbers of the Opposition so far as the Labour party's participation in 5KLA is concerned. I was recently in Tasmania with the broadcasting committee, which inquired into certain matters in relation to station 7DY, which asked permission to transfer the licence from its present location in Derby to the Midlands. Various organizations applied for the right to purchase shares in station 7DY. Although Government supporters have a majority on the committee, we did not adopt the policy which the Labour party is accused of favouring. We were prepared to grant station 7DY, if it so desired and if the Postmasterthe licence, but the statement which appeared in a section of the press that we recommended that the Labour party should be given an interest in the station was completely untrue. We made no such recommendation, but it was significant that one of the applications for the right to purchase an interest in the station came from the Tasmanian branch of the United Australia party. Its attitude was that if the Labour party were given an interest in the station, the United Australia party also should have an interest; but, if the Labour party were not given an interest, the United Australia party would not want one either. ,So far as South Australia is concerned, station 5KA offers the only opportunity that the Labour party has ever had to put its case before the people. Until that occurred, it never had fair representation either in No specific charges have been laid against the Government for its activities in connection with station 5KA. The Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) challenged the Leader of the Opposition to make specific charges, but I agree with the Minister for Munitions that the OpposiAnother interesting tion has no desire to do so, nor does it",66,Spender Ho W Much Did He Time I T Was £17 500 Which Divided By
373,Mr Chambers (Adelaide) [11.28j.,"really believe that there is anything dishonest in the 'transaction. It simply desires to throw mud at the Government, and to make political capital out of the whole business, but I am afraid that, instead of gaining any credit in South Australia, it has done itself and its supporters a grave injury, for its conduct will react in favour of the Labour party at the next general election. I have lived in Adelaide for practically the whole of my life, and I know the people concerned. I am confident that the honourable member for Barker( Mr( Mr Menzies). In defence of the GoArchie Cameron) will agree that during the whole of the time that the station has been on the air no public opposition has been raised to its management or to any agreement entered into in connection with it. that I cannot agree with the honourable member there. heard of any such opposition. I have been in Adelaide as often as the honourable member has, and the only reference that I have heard to the station has been favorable. As the Minister for Munitions said, it is becoming too popular, and there are other interests, at whose instigation, I believe, the Opposition has tried to stir up mud and create in the minds of the Australian people the belief that something .dishonest is going on. -There appears to be some uneasiness on the part of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Chambers) and other speakers on the government side lest a. certain amount of the mud stirred up in this debate should operate adversely to the Government or to the individuals concerned in the transactions under review. I suggest that the quickest and easiest way to dispel all doubts and suspicions is to throw the searchlight of an investi-' gation upon the matter. Then any party which feels that it is under suspicion will mittee to-day suggests that the Methodist have the opportunity of vindicating itself. I have 'been struck in this debate by the variety of defences put up by the Government side. We had first the extraordinary spectacle of the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) taking his place at the table and virtually throwing his honour into the ring. The honour of the Prime ber is making grave charges. Minister has never been in question in this matter, nor is it likely to be,. There was no necessity for him to go to the extent that he did to-night, and I am sure that he knows that. His name does not come into the business in a personal way, but his administration is certainly involved. That administration is now under fire, and it is no defence to recite in a dramatic way the story of a blameless life, such as we know his to be, and to brush aside all the pertinent questions asked by the Leader of the Opposition vernment the Minister for Munitions ( Mr Makin), and the Minister for In formation ( Mr Calwell) put the Central Methodist Mission and certain other respectable organizations and individuals in the dock, exonerated them, and then charged the Opposition with having unjustly accused these innocent people of corruption. We are not making any charges against the Central Methodist Mission. We are charging the Government, and it is no defence for honourable members opposite to place an innocent person in the dock, allege that his character has been blackened, and then proceed to clear it. I have listened carefully to the arguments advanced from both sides of the chamber, and as one who has brought a fresh mind to this matter, I believe that there is a case to answer. That answer has not yet been given. It is asked: "" Where are the charges of corruption ? The charges of corruption are made by no less a person than the Bishop of Newcastle, who has said, ""We are asked to he parties to what appears to be a corrupt, proposition "" or words to that effect. Is not that a charge worthy of an answer? It is no defence of the Government to say that the Central Methodist Mission was involved in an allegedly corrupt deal because it made certain concessions to the Labour party. The evidence placed before this comMission, in seeking to obtain a broadcasting licence, was placed under duress, and was informed that unless it granted substantial concessions to the Labour party, its chances of obtaining a licence were not very good.",67,Spender Ho W Much Did He Time I T Was £17 500 Which Divided By

377,Mr Drakeford,"The honourable memthese charges merit a much more complete answer than has been given by Government spokesmen. The correspondence between Mr Alderman and the Bishop of Newcastle showed that if the Church of England at Newcastle were willing to grant certain free broadcasting time, and an interest in station 2HD to tlie Labour party, the prospects of the licence being granted to the Church of England would be excellent, but that if these concessions were not made, the prospects of obtaining the licence would not be so good. ""We can assume that a similar proposition was put to the Central Methodist Mission in Adelaide, and accepted. If these charges be not true, then the simplest way to disprove them is to grant the Opposition's request for an inquiry. made on the flimsiest possible basis. Government will he cleared of these charges in a very short time, and there is no need for honourable members opposite to stall and to indulge in the obstructionist tactics that they have adopted to-night. One of the principal points made by the Minister for Munitions was that the file relating to this matter was quite open, and that no documents were missing; therefore, the whole transaction must be above board. Apparently, in the opinion of the Minister one has only to do something blatantly enough to get away with it. matter was available to the Broadcasting Committee had that body wished to peruse it. If the ^Broadcasting Committee did not examine the file, it, was not doing its duty. exactly what was before the Broadcasting Committee. It, has been stated in the course of this debate that the Broadcasting Committee was not aware that the Lahour party was to receive an interest in the South Australian station. dence we have heard to-night. As for the alleged impartiality of this mighty Broadcasting Committee, even Mr Alderman believed it to be "" loaded"" because he represented 152] that an application for a broadcasting licence would be granted because the Labour party would benefit. members opposite sit on such a committee. to me, too. I assure the Minister that if the matter rested with me, members of the Opposition would not sit on that committee. This matter must be cleared up. The only individuals who come out of the affair with credit are the high Government officials, such as the Solicitor General, Sir George Knowles, who has said, "" I may add that it appears to me not to be in the public interest that broadcasting licences should be the subject of bargaining"". I should like to know whether the Broadcasting Committee took that opinion into consideration. In my view, the committee is worthless so far as matters such as this are concerned, and the sooner transactions of this kind are removed from its jurisdiction, the better. Let the Postmaster-General (Senator Ashley) assume full responsibility, and not fob it off on a committee which is not competent to handle matters such as this. I assure honourable members opposite that although by .virtue of its majority the Government may succeed in burking an inquiry such as that suggested by the Opposition, the matter will not end there. The honourable member The file on this for Adelaide( Mr Chambers) expressed the opinion that the Opposition's attitude on this occasion would react to the advantage of the Government at the next Commonwealth elections. I challenge that, and I believe that time will prove the honourable member to be quite wrong. If the Government is not prepared to expose this matter to the light of day, honourable members on this side of the chamber are at liberty to draw their own inferences. The points that have been raised by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) require an answer. .

If , in fact no real option existed, then the whole transaction assumes a new light. The Government has power to grant enormous concessions of all kinds, and in the interests of the people generally that power should be exercised with the greatest impartiality. In this instance the challenge is that impartiality has not into charges which have had much less been shown, and that the Labour party has endeavoured to benefit itself by virtue of its occupation of the treasury bench. A strong case has been made out by the Opposition, and has not been answered by the Prime Minister( Mr that an attitude of mock righteous inCurtin) or by any other Minister. I support the motion. -Any impartial person who listened to the debate which took place when this matter first came before honourable members last week, could have come to no other conclusion than that the Government had a case to answer, and should grant the Opposition's request for a royal commission; but had that person listened also to the debate which has occurred to-night, he would have marvelled that the Government still resisted the demand for a royal commission. If i ever a case has been made for the appointment of a rcyal commission it has been made on this occasion. It was amazing indeed that the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) should have replied in such a dramatic manner to the charges that have been made against his Administration. The right honourable gentleman recountedhis virtuous record, and then challenged the committee to make personal charges against him. The Opposition does uot seek to make personal charges against the Prime Minister, except that the right honourable gentleman has been misled. Presumably the Prime Minister was acting upon advice, and apparently that advice was misleading. However, instead of making a specific answer to the charges, the right honourable assumed that his personal honesty had move to draw attention from the charges made by honourable members on this side documentary evidence. Any other government would have acceded to a request for a royal commission, but the Prime Minister has persisted in his refusal. His attitude can only make the Opposition suspicious as to what the Government has to hide. I venture to suggest that in recent years royal commissions have been appointed to inquire foundation than those made by the Opposition to-day. I say that the Government is not game to appoint a royal commission to inquire into these matters. The Prime Minister evidently believed dignation would appeal to the country; consequently he threw his prestige and honour into the ring, leaving the handling of the cast: for the Government to the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell), the Minister for the Navy( Mr Makin), and the Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward), who filled a similar role on the last occasion. If words mean anything, the disclosures which the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) made to-night indicate that there is something corrupt in regard to both transactions. If substantiation were needed, it has been provided by no less a person than the Bishop of Newcastle, who, in correspondence with the Postmaster-General (Senator Ashley) and the department, said that the proposal appeared to the Diocesan Council to be corrupt. When the reverend gentleman was asked whether he had referred to the Minister, he disclaimed any such intention, but did not withdraw the charge of corruption. allege corruption? That word has grave implications, and involves a number of things. I believe that this matter should be investigated. If corruption is alleged, against whom is the allegation made?

On the occasion of the last debate, the Minister for Information, who held the brief for the Government, s a i d Mr Alderman said in his evidence before tlie Broadcasting Committee that he could have obtained more than £8,500 for the Adelaide station which he had sold to the Methodist Mission. He was asked by commercial aud newspaper interests to sell to them and could have obtained £.15,000 or £10,000. With that naivete that is characteristic of him, the honourable gentleman added-Mr Alderman adopts a certain attitude towards life, and considers that the Labour party is entitled to a share of the air. I believe that Mr Alderman is a prominent member of the Labour party in South. Australia. Mr .MAKIN -To the best of my belief, he is not a member of the Labour party. a lot of business on behalf of tlie Government, and has an office at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, in which he does a lot of government work. of his standing do the same. office at Victoria Barracks. He is specially privileged. He said that he could have obtained much more than £S,500 from commercial interests for the Adelaide station, but omitted to say that those interests would refuse to be associated with the terms that lie laid down for the acquisition of the station. I put it to him that, had he effected a sale to newspaper and commercial interests, lie would not have obtained a solatium for the Labour party. Because they refused to be a party to such a transaction, he could not obtain £15,000 or £16,000 for a station that he subsequently sold for £S,500. The attempted to justify the circumstances in which the Prime Minister left the chamber to-night. The right honourable gentleman would have done a great service to this country and to his party, and might have dispelled quite a lot of the suspicion which exists if , instead of adopting that dramatic attitude, he had attempted to answer the allegations of the Leader of the Opposition. No answer has been given to the case that has been presented, and it appears that the Government has no intention of answering it. The Minister for Information replied to our request for a royal commission, by stating that there wa3 nothing to prevent the Broadcasting Committee from investigating the matter further. Such a statement carries no conviction to a committee which has heard extracts from a letter in which Mr Alderman, the commercial agent for the owners of station 2HD, advised the Bishop of Newcastle that he could not obtain the licence if he did not agree to the terms propounded, because the majority of the members of the Broadcasting Committee were Labour representatives, and the Postmaster General would take notice of their recommendations. When analysed, the sideissues into which the Minister has wound his difficult way in an endeavour to divert the committee, merely prove quite clearly that there are no grounds for his assumption that the matter could be cleared up by an investigation by other than a royal commission. Obviously, on the statement of Mr Alderman, the Broadcasting Committee is "" loaded "", because it contains a majority of Labour members who, obeying caucus dictation, vote as a body and make recommendations that will benefit the party. Mr Alderman said that, if the matter were referred to them, he knew what they would do; consequently, he tried to extort a gift under what might be termed duress. There is no doubt of that in my mind. The next speaker on the Government side was the Minister for Munitions, who said that this was an honest business deal. In the debate last week, the honourable gentleman tried to prove that Mr Richards held an option on station SKA. That has been completely exploded by the Leader of the Opposition. Not one Minister for Information Minister or Government member has been prepared to take up the challenge of the honourable member for Warringah. The Minister for Munitions can establish the correctness of his statement by giving the information for which the honourable member for Warringah has asked. If he does not do that, I must charge him with having made a statement which he knew was not correct.",70,Spender Ho W Much Did He Time I T Was £17 500 Which Divided By

His attack upon the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) was in the worse possible taste. A i l I want to say to the Minister is that any attack which he might level against the honourable member for Parramatta would only enhance the prestige and reputation of that honourable member. If any doubts as to the need for a royal the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) himcommission existed after the debate last week, they have been resolved by the case that has been placed before the committee to-night. The House was told five times that the Postmaster-General's Department had no knowledge of the February agreement, yet the files contain copies of it and correspondence relating to it, in addition to advice from Sir George Knowles to the Government against bargaining in the granting of wireless broadcasting licences. The tactics employed in connection with the Adelaide station were repeated when efforts were made to sell the Newcastle station, and these were of such a character that the gravest strictures were passed on them by the Diocesan Council. Questions asked in this Parliament were not answered truthfully, and a veil of mystery was drawn over the transactions. In my opinion, the public demand for a royal commission will be strengthened unless the Government is prepared to "" come clean"" and answer the charges that have been made. not propose to traverse at length ground that has been comprehensively covered by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr the charges. In this instance the Prime Menzies) and subsequent speakers from this side of the chamber. It appears to me that this incident, which first arose from a request for an investigation of the circumstances surrounding the granting of a broadcasting licence and the transfer of certain assets, has been lifted to a far more important plane. The absence of a decision will establish a precedent within this Parliament in relation to the reception given to such charges by a government. Under the British parliamentary system the practice from time immemorial has been to keep the government of the day beyond suspicion, and, if any circumstances ever arise in which the Government falls under suspicion the matter should be cleared up immediately. Tlie accepted manner of investigating such a 'matter is to appoint a royal commission. I had thought that the two members of this Parliament, who, perhaps above all, were sticklers for the proprieties of the British parliamentary system of government were self and the Leader of the Opposition. I cannot readily recall a single instance of failure on the part of a Prime Minister in the past to conform to the traditional practice. I am sure that nobody can point to any action by the Leader of the Opposition as having been contrary to the practice, which we have inherited, and which we have the responsibility of safeguarding and passing on inviolate to those who come after us. The Leader of the Opposition, after twenty years of membership of Australian Parliaments, now says, "" Here are circumstances backed by indisputable facts A, B, and C, which make it appear, prima facie, that an improper course has been followed in the administration of this Government"". He asks that the Government should clear itself of any doubt or charge by the appointment of a royal commission to investigate fully the circumstances. My experience in this Parliament extends over only ten years, but never have I previously known the Leader of the Opposition to make a strong prima facie case for an investigation and the head of the Government to refrain from any reply to Minister has broken a precedent which has stood throughout our Parliamentary history.

He left three of his Ministers to reply to the charges, and two of them are not notorious for keeping any debate on a particularly high and unbiased plane. Charges of this nature cannot be replied to appropriately by counter charges. If any counter charges can and should be made, let them be stated. The Leader of the Opposition and those seated behind him have said that such counter charges could be included in the terms of reference to the royal commission, but it should not be claimed that charges can be answered by counter accusations. It will be a sorry day for the Government, which almost invariably refers to itself as the Labour Government, if it thinks that it can clear itself of serious charges merely by refertions to the Sydney General Post. Office, ring to matters debated at an election held twenty odd years ago, and asking, ""What did you do in 1924?"" Charges of this nature cannot be met by making counter allegations; they cannot be answered by hurling dirt, and there has been more than a fair share of that. I do not imagine that the Prime Minisappointed."" Overnight, a commission ter possesses sufficient authority to control his own Ministers. We have been forced to realize over a long experience that he is quite unable to control them. Therefore, I do not saddle him with responsibility for what his Ministers' say, but to allegations made by the Leader of the Opposition of improper administration, nobody hut the Prime Minister himself can reply. Driven from one side of the ring to the other, after the third case? Stripped of all the murk and week of this debate, the right honourable muck thrown by the Minister for Transgentleman was eventually forced to rise to port ( Mr Ward) and the Minister for his feel, but not one word was uttered Information, surely the fact is that by him in rebuttal of the charges. No a broadcasting licence can be issued attempt was made to give a further exby the Postmaster-General, which means, planation ; there was merely a dramatic no doubt, by the Cabinet. gesture. No matter how dramatic the licence, beyond question, has a money gesture might be, it provided no answer value, and can be of use only to somebody to concrete charges. It will be a bad who possesses the necessary equipment to day for this Parliament when a government may ignore serious charges because it has a sufficient number of supporters who are pledged and obliged to vote blindly for it, irrespective of their convictions. To what degree some members of the Labour party are obliged to do so has been exemplified in the most powerful way by the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell). I have the most lively recollection that, when the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Bill was before us, that Minister, who was then a private member, declared that in no circumstances would he be found voting for the measure but eventually he did so. that occasion second a motion in opposition to his own Government? illustration of the complete regimentation of members behind the Government, and upon that fact the Prime Minister relies. On a previous occasion, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) was Postmaster-General, an honourable member asked why a variation had taken place in the contract for addiand requested the appointment of a royal commission. The Leader of the Opposition, who was then Prime Minister, replied: "" Very well. If there is the slightest scintilla of a suggestion that something improper has been done, let a royal commission be was appointed. When tlie leader of my party was Prime Minister, and an honourable member on this side declared that certain dealings between the Government and some trade union leaders ought to be investigated, the then Leader of the Opposition, now the Prime Minister, immediately said: "" Let us have a royal commission."" What are the circumstances in this That",72,Spender Ho W Much Did He Time I T Was £17 500 Which Divided By

395,Mr Mcewen,"Yes. That is anerect and operate a station. Because of the circumstances of war, it was not possible to replace the equipment or to purchase new equipment, so a gentleman was called in who has appeared in so many guises that it is almost impossible to follow him. He is King's' Counsel, adviser to the Government, arbitrator for the Government on certain matters, counsel for the Commonwealth in legal proceedings, Witnesses, and a good friend of the Australian Lahour party. He related to the Broadcasting Committee that he was authorized to sell the equipment, which, at that time, was the only equipment procurable in Australia with which the licence could be made effective. He has said: "" I asked the agent for Jehovah's Witnesses to authorize realization of the assets of the station. I could have sold the station for £15,000 to a newspaper company, but I am a friend of the Labour party, and thought that it was entitled to a broadcasting station."" And he-the realize on the assets of this corporate body which had virtually been put into liquidation-decided, the Labour party, not to accept an offer of £15,000 from an Adelaide newspaper, but to offer the asset to the Central Methodist Mission for £S,400 subject to certain conditions of benefit to the Labour party. This has been represented to us as a straight out business transaction. Even if we go no further than the facts I have just related, it was a very curious sort of business transaction, and there would he ground for probing it, for seeking to learn why the asset had been disposed of in such a way. I pass by the points raised by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) regarding the nature of the alleged option, the consideration in respect to it, and the document in which it was embodied, and simply recall that the Minister for Munitions ( Mr Makin) told us that Mr Richards held the option in his personal right, while Mr Richards himself told the Broadcasting Committee that he held it on behalf of the Labour party. Putting aside those inexplicable and conflicting stories, I come back to the fact, that it was proposed to issue the licence for the Newcastle station on. what appeared to have become the Mr Mcfhccn. crystallized and stable terms for such transactions. They were something like this: "" You want a licence that has become available. All right, you pay so much for the apparatus without which you could not use a licence and then, if you have the right connexions, you get an assurance that, if you undertake to make over a certain proportion of your shares to the Lahour party, or to some other body which counsel for Jehovah's acts as the agent of the Labour party, and if you agree to allot so much, time on the station to the Labour party, the licence will automatically issue "". It may be possible to explain away what appears to us on this side of the House, and to a large section of the public, to be incapable of explanation, but no real attempt has been made in this Parliament to explain it. Certainly no attempt was made by the Minister for Information, who has constituted himself principal spokesman for the Government. He first asked what the anti-Labour person authorized to parties did in 1924, and apparently he felt that, by making charges against his opponents, he could divert attention from as the friend of the charges which had been made against the Government. No more complete reply could he made to his own charges than that offered by the Leader of the Opposition. However, the Leader of the Opposition has not taken his stand merely uponhis own refutation of the charges; he has said that if the Government wishes those charges to be investigated by a royal commission, let it :be done by all means. Now, the stark fact still stands out that certain licences were available which could be issued, at the will of the Government in office, and the consideration in one case Involved, not only .the giving of free broadcasting time to the Labour party, but also the. making over of shares of value to tbe Labour party. Earlier this evening, the Prime Minister made it clear that he felt that, without some addition to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition, they could only be construed as involving himself in a transaction touching money or some consideration of value, and that ho was not prepared to lie under such a charge. As I understand the facts of the case, the only consideration of value which it was suggested had passed in respect of the Adelaide station was shares to the value of £2,400, these having been allotted to the Workers' Weekly Herald. Surely there is no room there for even the most active imagination to deduce that the Prime Minister himself had personally profited. MrM KNZIES -The Prime Minister acquitted himself of a charge never made against him. embark upon a discussion of the Prime Minister's association with the matter. There cannot be the slightest justification for assuming that the Prime Minister, or any Minister, or any person has profited by the acquisition of money' or shares. The charge i.= that the Labour party has profited, and it is impossible to separate the fact that the Labour party has profited from ihi? fact that a Labour Government is in office. It was a Labour administration which approved the issue of a licence in the only circumstances in which the Labour party could profit. In an attempt to avoid replying to the charges some honourable members have dwelt on the activities of a church organization. The church organization could not have acquired the lic.nce had it not bought the only apparatus available on condition that, having paid the full price for the apparatus, it should allot a share in the asset thu acquired to tlie Labour party without receiving any consideration in return. Important as it is that this should bp investigated, it is f a r ' more important that the Government should not establish the precedent that the Leader of the Opposition may make out so clearcut a case in support of his charge of improper conduct, without its drawing an effective reply from any member of the Government, or even a promise that the charge will be judicially examined.

'CONELAN-The right honourable Alderman said, "" You give this to the gentleman is running, away. away. I stated my case with the utmost clarity, and it contained no suggestion that the Prime Minister himself had secured any personal advantage from this transaction. The one statement to which an answer personally by the Prime Minister was demanded was that, in the course of an answer to a question, and in the course of a personal explanation, he had put before this committee information which investigation proved to be inaccurate. As I said the other day when I raised the matter, I had no doubt-and I have no doubt now-that the Prime Minister was misinformed, both when he gave his answer, and when he made the explanation. I would have expected him to seize the opportunity to say, ""Well, having regard to what you tell me is in the files, I realize that I have been misinformed, and, therefore, the House has been misinformed by me "". Instead of that, however, we were treated to what I can only describe as a histrionic exhibition by the right honourable gentleman when he declared, "" Charge me with something!"" There are two questions to which the people of Australia will require an answer: What was the proposed Dayment to or for the benefit of the Labour party designed to achieve? What were the grounds upon which Mr Alderman said, "" If you accept these conditions your chance of getting the licence is more than good; if you reject them, your chance is not worth discussing""? I add to that the very pertinent question which was raised by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), namely, "" Where is this option?"" I ask: was there an option; if so, was it paid for; what was its value, and what value was obtained for the transfer?

A motion having been made, and the mover having replied, is it in order to discuss other items before that motion has been disposed of? Each honourable member is entitled to speak in committee for two periods of 30 minutes each. When the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) was addressing the committee his first period of 30 minutes expired, whereupon the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) moved that an extension of time be granted. That motion was agreed to. In addition the Leader of the Opposition has just exercised his right to speak for a second period of 30 minutes. was amazed to hear what the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) had to *n.j regarding the transfer of a radio broadcasting licence from an organization known as Jehovah's Witnesses to the Central Methodist Mission of South Australia and the Australian Labour party in that State. The right honourable gentleman impugned the honesty of the Prime Minister by stating that he was a participant in the allocation of that licence. I regret that the Leader of the Opposition should have cast so grave a reflection on the integrity of the Prime Minister. It is deplorable that, for party political purposes, any honourable gentleman should stoop to such things. should accept the assurance of the Leader of the Opposition that no suggestion of improper conduct on the pant of the Prime Minister was made, or was intended. the Prime Minister challenged the Leader of the Opposition to lay a definite accusawill show the people of Australia what tion against him, and offered, in that event, to remain out of the House until his reputation was cleared, but the Leader of the Opposition did not say a word. Now the right honourable gentleman has endeavoured to "" square off "". What are the facts? Mr Alderman, KC., an eminent South Australian barrister, who was the legal adviser of Jehovah's Witnesses appealed to the High Court on their behalf against the closing down of their broadcasting stations. The High Court ruled that Jehovah's Witnesses were entitled to operate the stations or to dispose of their assets. Acting on behalf of his principals, Mr Alderman_ offered the Adelaide station to various persons in South Australia. The first person to approach him in the matter was Mr Richards, the Leader of the Labour party in the South Australian Parliament. Mr Richards accidentally met Mr Alderman, and mentioned the matter? member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) as a business man would have found a way of meeting Mr Alderman had he been interested in the purchase of the station. The first people to whom the station was offered were not keen to accept the offer, and Mr Richards decided to take an option over it. Later he decided to transfer that option to the Australian Labour party in South Australia. cided to transfer his option to the Workers' Weekly Herald. The Leader of the Opposition has impugned the honesty of prominent members of the Methodist Church in South Australiamen who have rendered valuable service to the people of that State and for whom I have the greatest respect. I am confident that the people of this country will approve the transfer of the licence from Jehovah's Witnesses to the Central Methodist Mission in Adelaide and the Workers' Weekly Herald, and will absolve them from any charge of corruption. The Leader of the Opposition has done a great disservice to his country. His disgraceful conduct to-day they may expect from the Opposition in this Parliament. The first stages of this transaction took .place during the regime of a previous government. When that government was defeated and its members were transferred to the.

409,Mr Conelan,"Mr Richards debenches, some of them thought that the Opposition parties would gain a political advantage if this matter were raised in the Parliament. I point out that although the transfer of the licence in question took place before the last federal elections, the people of South Australia decided to support the Labour Government and to relegate many non-Labour candidates to political obscurity. Minister and Miiii-tor for Defence) [12.45 a.m.J I have not very much to say. I listened to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) earlier this evening. A. great part of it I regarded as the bringing out of facts which he thought would substantiate the case that he was submitting to the committee. I reduce that case to the elements that moved me to say what I said earlier in this debate. why it should not re-open its investigaThe right honourable gentleman said that he had inspected the file. On a previous occasion he described the whole transaction as corrupt. I have since read the Hansard report of all that was said when the matter was before honourable members last week. The right honourable gentleman used the word ""corruption"" not once, but several times, and, of course, the parties to this episode are involved in the charge. The right honourable gentleman made it very clear that in his view a certain sum of money had gone somewhere. He said that in his search through the files which were placed at the disposal of the Opposition without any demur, he had found that on a given date there had been a consultation, between the Treasurer ( Mr ferred. My knowledge of this matter Chifley), the Postmaster-General (Senator Ashley) and myself, and that the Postmaster-General, as the result of that Richards, a man whose personal integrity consultation, had directed that the licence should be transferred to the company that had been formed -with one-fifth of its shares held by the Workers' Weekly Herald. Having regard to what had heen said previously and the general implications of what the right honourable srcntleman had put forward, I considered that he had definitely implicated the Treasurer and myself as being responsible for the decision that the Postmaster-General had reached. connected what was said last week with the very dreadful inferences which I drew from the speech of the right honourable gentleman to-night, and I referred to my own personal affairs. I do not need to repeat what 1 said. NowI gather that the right honourable gentleman says that no charge of the character which I have in mind was even contemplated as involving me. I take it that that applies to the Treasurer as well. applies to the Postmaster-General as well. Well, what is left? There is no accusation that any Minister abused his office for his own personal gain or other purposes which can be construed as contrary to his oath of office. There is a question as to whether this transaction would hear the light nf day. It has already been before the Broadcasting Committee, which is a statutory body. There is no reason tions if it wishes to do so. It may, of course, be alleged that the committee includes Labour members, as it has been alleged in this debate as sinister that a Labour government has done these things. If that is the case, no Lahour broadcasting station could conceivably be granted a licence during the tenure of office of the Labour party without charges being levelled and investigation demanded. nonsensical statement. If it were true the whole administration would fall into chaos. I have never heard of accusations having been made against previous governments because licences were transconsists of simple facts. The Leader of the Lahour party in South Australia, Mr has never been called into question by anybody, gained an option, as he says, over property which Jehovah's Witnesses had offered for sale. by production of the option. also admitted that Mr Alderman say? that he could have sold the property for a higher price to a newspaper.

416,Mr Curtin,"He said that. It isknowledge of this matter is that Mr given in the Senate by the PostmasterRichards not only had an option but also could dispose of that option as he thought fit. It was a matter between him and the person or company that purchased the option. The Postmaster General advised me that he construed the transaction between the man who held the option, which had been given to him, as the Postmaster-General believed, by the vendor company, as entirely unrelated to hi.s duty as Postmaster-General in deciding whether the licence should be transferred. between the Treasurer, the Postmaster General and myself, the matters discussed were, first, whether the company had capital in excess of what would be reasonable-that is a matter which the Treasurer has to deal with in regard to all companies formed for any purposeand, secondly-the only other point left for me to advise the Postmaster-General on-whether the Central Methodist Mission should be given a licence. Having regard to the debates in Parliament and the act, which we had a look at, I could see no earthly reason why the licence should not be transferred to the Central Methodist Mission. If any impropriety is involved in this matter, which has already run the gauntlet of the Broadcasting Committee, a statutory committee of this Parliament, there can be no reason whatever why the Ministry should resist the re-opening of the inquiry which may now be regarded as not having comipletely covered the field. The Government has nothing to hide. Mislakes may have been made. appear that I misled the House the other day. I misled it because the department was clearly of the view that it would have no cognizance of a matter which did not concern it, even though that matter was on the file. It was said that the other agreement, the contract of sale, did not concern the department. All that the department was concerned with was whether or not the licence should be transferred to the Central Methodist Mission. That may have been just a misunderstanding as to what the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Guy) had sought. My position in the matter is that the answer I gave to the honourable gentleman was in complete conformity with the answer that had been Mr Curtin. General to a question upon notice. I accept the assurance of the Leader of the Opposition and other honourable members of the Opposition that my personal participation in this matter is not questioned and that that applies to the Treasurer and the Postmaster-General. I submit that if further inquiry is called for the statutory comimittee that this Parliament has already set up is free to make any investigation it may think fit.

417,( Mr Menzies's Amendment) Be So Reduced.,"I bring to the notice of the committee a complaint I have to make against the Postmaster-General's Department with respect to a letter which I received from the Postmaster-General (Senator Ashley) dealing with delay in delivery of internal correspondence in this country, and the reasons given by the Postmaster-General for that delay. In July of this year, I sent to him two envelopes, one of which was addressed from a place in Victoria to a place in New South Wales, and the other was a reply between the same addresses. I asked the Postmaster General the reason for the delay, and also why one letter was opened by the censor, although it was an internal communication. I waited for two months, and in the meantime made several requests for a reply. Ultimately, after the report of the Royal Commission on Censorship had been presented to Parliament, I received the following reply, which was dated the 22nd September:With further reference to your rcprcsentati s on behalf of the S. S. White Co. of Australia Pty. Ltd., the matter of the treatment of the two letters referred to (one addressed to G. Maegrcgor. Esq.. Sydney, and the other to Mr E. X . White. Mel.b.) has formed the subject of investigation by .the Department of the Army. In a. memorandum dated 2nd September, that Department advised that the cover addressed to Mr Macgregor was opened by the Censor in error. The letter appears to have been mis-sorted in the first instance and In have reached Censorship amongst mail for overseas addresses. It was then opened and censored in the normal way before the Censorship official noticed that it was an internal communication which had got out of course. In the case of the letter addressed to Mr ship is no guarantee that it has not been White. I am sorry that I am not able to explain the cause of the delay. The Department of the Army pointed out that the cover bore no evidence of censorship and that inquiries indicated that in nil probability it had not been sighted by the Censorship Authorities. Inquiries within this Department show that, on the evidence available, the letter should have reached Melbourne on 21st July in time for delivery on that date, hut it is possible (hat it did not arrive until the 22nd (Saturilnv) in which case it would have been too late for delivery that day. Accepting the -statement that delivery was not effected until 24th July, the delay seems to have taken place between Sydney and Melbourne., and if this was so, I would ask you kindly to express my regret to the senders. The envelopes are returned herewith as requested. I shall deal first with the letter which showed no signs of having been opened by the censor. The reply I have received in respect of that letter is rather extraordinary. I have always thought that when a letter is opened by the censor, the proper procedure is to mark it : "" Opened by Censor"" ; and if it is not so marked, one might rightly assume that it has not heen opened. But the Postmaster General's reply does not make possible so easy an assumption, because, in respect of the letter in question, the Department of the Army pointed out that the cover bore no evidence that the letter had been censored, and that inquiries indicated that "" in all probability it had not heen sighted by censorship "". That is a most extraordinary statement from the Minister who controls internal correspondence, and who, if Mr Justice Webb's conclusion is correct there is no general observation of inland mails, and only communications from persons suspected of espionage, or sabotage, are submitted to inquiries is correct, must know that this internal correspondence has been unduly delayed. As an explanation of that delay, he says that in all probability it has not been sighted by censorship. My first observation is that, in respect of a letter which has been delayed, and which bears no external mark of having been opened by censorship, he was not able to say immediately that the letter had not been opened by censorship. My second observation is that it is obvious from his reply that the mere fact that the letter does not appear to have been opened by censoropened by censorship. With respect to the other letter which was opened by censorship, the reply given to me was of the kind which I expected to receive. Whenever an internal letter in this country is opened by the censor, the official explanation invariably offered is that by some strange circumstance it got into the overseas mail. I am very apt to believe everything told to me by responsible officials; but this reply does not ""go over"" with me, because, on more than one occasion, when it has been brought to my notice that internal mail has been scrutinized, the reply has been that in some strange way it got mis-sorted with",78,Pairs
418,"Mr Spender (""Warringah) [1.2 A.m.].","the overseas mail. I have two comments to make: First, it is about time that the Postmaster-General exercised better control over internal mail in order to make certain that it does not get mis-sorted; and, secondly, the reply given in this case letters censored are those coming into or is extraordinary because it is obvious when you look at the printing on each envelope, particularly the one opened by the censor, that it is internal mail. It is difficult to understand how internal mail of that description comes to be opened by censorship, and no one knows anything about it until I bring the fact to the notice of the department; then tlie explanation, two months delayed, is that it must have been mis-sorted. That explanation is entirely unsatisfactory. Parliament has an obligation to keej> internal mail inviolate. It should not he interfered with except for the reasons given by Mr no censorship of internal mail during Justice Webb; but it is by no means clear that those are the only reasons which persuade the censorship to open mails. At this stage I shall not be in order in discussing Mr Justice Webb's report, but I draw the attention of the committee to the reply sent to me after a lapse of two months, which is so unsatisfactory that it throws doubts upon the efficiency of the Postmaster-General's .Department, and raises doubt with respect to the degree over the Minister for Information. to which internal mail is censored for reasons which have no relation to security. for Information.)

The only going out of Australia, and letters coming from, or going to, operational areas. The great, bulk of letters circulating in Australia are not subject to censorship at all.

The only letters upon which the censorship mark is affixed, are those coming into or leaving Australia, and those coming or going to operational areas. Letters addressed to suspected persons, or going to or from persons suspected of tax evasion are necessarily not marked by the censor. If they were, the tax evader, for example, would know from the censorship mark on the envelope that his mail was being watched.

The Estimates provide a substantial amount for new works in this connection, but the Postmaster General's Department usually adopts the view that a certain amount of revenue must be in prospect before such works can be undertaken. If our country districts are to progress, a. more liberal policy must be adopted in regard to capital expenditure involved'in the erection of trunk lines in the sparsely populated areas. For example, in the south western part of Queensland, from Dalby to Charleville, there is no connection with central Queensland, with a through trunk line to meet the Rockhampton and Cracow districts.

438,Mr Archie Cameron,"That is-concerned. In my opinion, the first -approach to the proper settlement of the difficulties of the Northern Territory is tlie granting of some form of local self government there. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Barnard) -The honourable member will not be in order in developing that theme. dealing with works, and local self government would require a building in which to meet. Therefore, I consider that I am entitled to develop my theme. Already a proposal for local self government has been submitted to the Prime Minister. If some form of self government were granted, many causes of complaint would be corrected. Many of these things are done after reference to the Department of the Interior at Canberra, and I am. afraid that sometimes the advice of the people on the spot has not been fully considered, with the result that expense has heen incurred which would not have been incurred if local people had had some control, or, at any rate, the right to give advice. A proposal has been put to either the Prime Minister or the Treasurer in regard to a committee which the Government is believed to have formed to make recommendations for the future development of the Territory. Unless that committee is working on the spot and has the co-operation of certain people in the Northern Territory who have distinguished themselves in developmental research, I am afraid that the results will not be the 1.00 per cent, that might be expected if the Government co-operated with the local people. I warn the Treasurer, as the representative of the Governestablish a Jewish settlement in the ment at the table to-night, that before very long I hope to occupy some time on a private members' day to debate matters of general interest in connection with the Territory. I noticed in yesterday's press that the Government had decided to rebuild Darwin. That is something for which everybody who has to use the town as the front door to Australia will be thankful. Darwin badly needs rebuilding in accordance with a proper townplanning scheme. Like Topsy, it has just "" growod "". a.m.] I subscribe to what has been said as to the national importance of the development of the Northern Territory and the Kimberley district of Western Australia. Last week, in discussing the budget, I referred briefly to the difficulties being experienced by cattle-raisers in the Kimberleys. I should be most interested to see the letters which the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) has received from residents of the Kalgoorlie electorate with regard to the development of stock routes towards Alice Springs. Recently, I made a station-to-station visit in the Kiinberleys, and discussed with the men directly concerned the problems confronting the people there. Their chief desire was for the re-opening of the Wyndham meat works and the establishment of inland abattoirs to deal with the stock close to where it was reared. I appreciate that more than one outlet may be necessary, and for that reason I subscribe to the policy of improving and watering the various stock routes which would give outlets to the people raising beef under extreme difficulties there to-day. There is a prospect of settling in the Kimberley area a very substantial population. I have had the opportunity of viewing practically the whole of the Commonwealth. I know the Queensland country fairly well, and I know almost the whole of Western Australia. I have never seen land superior in quality to the land of the Kimberley district. It has a conformation which enables water conservation schemes for irrigation purposes to be conveniently carried out. iSome time ago, a proposition, was submitted to the Western Australian Government to Kimberley district. I am most anxious to see the district settled, because no nation can justify holding an area with such possibilities unless it is prepared to make provision for its development. Not only is the Kimberley district rich in arable and pasture land, but it is also rich in mineral wealth. It may not be generally known that the first discovery of gold in Western Australia was made at Hall's Creek in the Kimberleys.
