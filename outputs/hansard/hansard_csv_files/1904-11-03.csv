I think, come to know, the result of the second effort to obtain suitable offers for carrying out the ocean mailservice, under the new condition of things brought about by the enactment of a certain provision in the Post and Telegraph Act, has been that one tender has been sent in by the Orient Steam Navigation Company. That tender is for a sum of Â£150,000, which was also the amount of the tender received on a that whereas in the former tender there weie certain provision for refrigerating chambers incidental to the service, the new tender which we have received omits all reference to those highly desirable conditions. In the new offer there is no proposal made for any accommodation for perishable products, consequently the second offer received is distinctly more unfavorable than the first. In the circumstances, the Cabinet had no hesitation whatever in deciding as they did to-day to reject the tender. the' answer given by the Prime Minister, I should like to ask the Postmaster-General whether he has yet elaborated a scheme for the carriage of mails from the end of the year, or whenever the present contract runs out? of the mail contract' was considered by the details of the action which will be taken by the Government in the future have not yet been determined upon.

I admit that there is not much time to spare, but it must be remembered that although the matter has been under consideration for a considerable period, we have not been in office very long, and the matter only came under our notice quite recently. The tender was rejected on the ground mentioned by the Prime Minister, and the whole question is now being looked into, with a view to arrive at the best possible arrangement. ment to which the Minister has referred? fact that we have not received a satisfactory tender, it becomes the duty of the Government to ascertain what other means there are of carrying on the mail service in the best interests of the Commonwealth. his reply, referred to certain new conditions that had been imposed, consequent on the provisions of the Post and Telegraph Act relative to the employment of coloured labour on mail steamers.

That the Treasurer invite the approval and co-operation of the States, with the view of obtaining through the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and the States the necessary constitutional complications and difficulties requiring for and statutory authorities to give effect lo the foregoing. I recognise that I am extremely fortunate in being able to ask honourable members to consider this motion so soon after having given notice of it. I should like to express my thanks to the Treasurer) who has voluntarily -certainl y without my knowledge-bee n kind enough to lay upon the table as an official paper the memorandum prepared by me. When I issued the memorandum in the form of a circular, I desired to place in"" the hands of honourable members in as condensed and connected a form as possible a statement of my views on this important matter, and consequently was only too glad to undertake any expense that might be entailed in doing so. When I was in London at the beginning of last year, steps were being taken to float a Victorian conversion loan, and I was very much impressed by the fact that it would have been greatly to the advantage of that Statei f the Commonwealth or some other authority had been appointed to undertake the conversion. Had steps been taken in that direction some two or three years ago, in the earlier days of the Commonwealth, it might reasonably have been expected that the imprimatur of the Commonwealth would have possessed considerable value, whereas at present I am afraid that no special advantage would follow from the Commonwealth instead of an individual State undertaking the operation. I wish to say at once that I can add practically nothing to the very able memorandum which the Treasurer submitted to the Conference of States Treasurers. The right honourable gentleman dealt exhaustively with the whole of the difficulties that surround the very important matter of the transfer of the States loans to the Commonwealth. I shall not unnecessarily go over ground which the right) honourable gentleman has so ably covered; but inasmuch as I disagree with his opinions upon two very important points, I wish to state the nature of mv disagreement. In the first place. I do not take the sanguine view which he holds of the willingness of the States individually or collectively to submit themselves entirely to Mr Knox. Commonwealth control and authority. In the second place, I think that the difficulties of the situation are very great. Every one who reads the right honourable gentleman's memorandum, together with the reports of the discussions at the Conference, and makes an examination of the whole question, will see that it is surrounded with their settlement some such authority as that which I am now suggesting. The Treasurer has indicated that he thinks, that the Commonwealth Treasurer should be that authority; but I differ from him. there, because I believe that we should have an independent authority, since the States will not entirely surrender their control, and submit themselves to the Commonwealth. I ask the attention of honourable members to section 105 of the Constitution, which gives the Commonwealth power to take over the debts of the States. It is as follows :The Parliament may take over from the States their public debts as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or a proportion thereof, according to the respective numbers of their people as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, and may convert, renew, or consolidate such debts, or any part thereof; and the States shall indemnif y the Commonwealth in respect of the debts taken over, and thereafter the interest payable in respect of the debts shall be deducted and retained from the portions of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth payable to the several States, or if such surplus is insufficient, or if there is no surplus, then the deficiency of the whole amount shall be paid by the: several States. Then section 51 provides thatThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to :(xxxvii.) Matters referred to the Parliament of the Commonwealth by the Parliament or Parliaments of any State or States, but so that the law shall extend only to States by whoseParliaments the matter is referred, or which afterwards adopt the law.. It will be seen that section 105 gives the Parliament an arbitrary power, whereas under paragraph' XXXVII. of section 51 the debts can be taken over with the approval of the States. I should like to recall to honourable members the history of the consideration of this matter. It was first dealt with so far back as 1891 by the -Convention which then sat in Sydney. The members of that Convention were firmly of opinion that one great object of union was the consolidation of the debts of the States. Then in 1897, in. Adelaide, to quote from the impressed honourable members with that monumental work of Quick and Garran on view, I shall proceed to quote certain figures the ConstitutionThere was much diversity of opinionupon the will be found very interesting. It is held whole subject. Mr Reid had nothing to say, by one important financial authority that so long as no compulsory proposition was made. borrowing, as long as it is justly and pruSir George Turner would have liked a compuldently undertaken, is one of the great indisory taking over of all the debts, but, in view of Mr Reid's strong objection, he did not press cations of industrial progress throughout the this. Still, he thought that the power should be world. I have ventured to believe that the to take all the debts of the States, and he objected House may be interested in a table, which I to the consent of the States being required. Mr have taken from the latest edition of the pulsory consolidation meant making a present of Encyclopedia the Federal security to the bondholders; but they principal public debts of the world in 1900, approved of giving the Parliament power to act but I do' not propose to weary honourable without the consent of the States. Some thought members by elaborating the figures. In 1900, that the power should be limited to existing debts; others thought that it ought to extend to future the world's debt, in t'he shape of public debts. Some thought that future State borrowloans, amounted to Â£6,152,841,525. It is ing should be restricted; others that this was imsignificant that, according to this authority, possible. Eventually, on Sir George Turner's New Zealand, at the date named, had .a motion, the requirement of the consent of the State Parliaments was omitted, on division, by total debt of Â£47,874,452, and stood, so twenty to fifteen, and the power was limited to far as capital responsibility per head of its "" the whole, or. a rateable proportion of the pubpopulation was concerned, at the very top lic debts of the States as existing at the estabof the list, its public debt amounting to lishment of the Commonwealth."" The provision requiring any savings made to be spent in reducÂ£ 5 8 12s. per head. tion of interest, was negatived, and Mr Higgins added a declaration that the "" rateable proportion "" should be calculated on a population basis. . . . . At Melbourne, Mr Glynn moved an amendment providing for compulsory consolidation of debts, each State indemnifying the Commonwealth for any excess of its debts over the average indebtedness. This, after a long debate, then moved to insert, after "" Parliament,"" the words "" may take over the whole or any part of the debt of the State, subject to the consent of the State."" On this, Sir George Turner moved the substitution of "" shall"" for "" may,"" which was carried by twenty-five votes to eight; a division, w'hich, coming as it did after the rejection of the guarantees, signified a desire on the part of the Convention to make some definite provision with regard to the threefold problem of the debts, the railways, and the guarantees.

The Convention, after some debate, showed a disposition to reverse the effect of its vote. The amendment was consequently amended by the omission of all words after ""shall take over;"" but t-he proposal to insert these words in the clause was negatived on division. I wish to place this information on the records, as establishing the fundamental fact that there existed in the minds of the representatives of the States at* each of the Federal Conventions, including the Convention held as far back as 1891, an appreciation of the very great difficulties which surround this question.

I do not desire to make any unfair comparison, and shall be glad to have my attention drawn to any statement which, in the opinion of honourable members, may be erroneous. The Australian States are second on this table, to which, although it is not quite up to date, I intend to adhere, in order that we may have a uniform comparison. The total debts of the Australian States is set down at Â£195,324,717, or a capital responsibility of know, however, that the public indebtedness of Australia has been largely increased since 1900, and that it now amounts to over Â£222,000,000. the date named, Canada had a debt of Â£53,254,689, showing a capital responsibility :of only Â£ 1 0 per head of the population, that the United Kingdom is eleventh on the list, with a responsibility of Â£ 1 5 7s. 6d. per head of the population, or a total indebtedness of Â£628,978,782 ; and that the United States of America had a responsibility of only Â£ 3 15s. 6d. per head of the population, their total debt being Â£292,216,265.

It is true there are a few privately-owned railways in the States, but speaking generally, Australia's large indebtedness is represented by a magnificent public asset, which is revenue producing. If we deducted the railway expenditure of the different States, and placed them on the one basis, we should probably present a very much better position than we have hitherto done. not take the trouble to inquire what led to our incurring this large indebtedness. They do not stop to inquire what were the special circumstances of its creation. probably assume that it has been incurred as the result of wars and various social disturbances; but the people of Australia know that the system adopted by the States of building their own railways has been mainly responsible for it. I intend now to deal with later figures, relying chiefly upon Coghlan, and upon statements' submitted to the Treasurers' Conference by Treasurer, whose memoranda, I would repeat, mation we require upon this subject. -I find that the total indebtedness of Australia is.Â£222,871,765. more than twelve months old, now. the Treasurer will understand that in order to make comparisons, I am obliged to accept statistics as they existed upon a common date; and for that purpose, I have adopted the figures which are presented in the last issue of Coghlan, page 829. ThereI find that the indebtedness of Australia is made up of Â£212,028,000 worth of inscribed stock and debentures, and a floating debt of Â£10,843,000. It may be interesting to honourable members to know that at the period to which I refer, the States bore an annual burden in the shape of interest of Â£8,090,788, equal to Â£ 2 is. 5d. per head of the. population. amount of the interest, without taking into I have no desire consideration the earnings of the different public works. urer points out, that is the gross amount bondholders, irrespective of the revenue which we receive from various public works. PerhapsI may be permitted to direct special attention to the enormous increase which has occurred in the public indebtedness of these States. Between 1861 and 1871, there was an increase in that indebtedness of Â£ 1 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; between 1871 and 1881, an addition of Â£ 3 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; and between 1881 and 1891 an increase of Â£89,000,000. The last-named decade was one in which the whole world seemed to incur large liabilities; and an Victoria it was known as the great "" boom "" period. Between 1891 The people of other countries do and 1902-3, notwithstanding the adverse conditions which succeeded the boom, Australia increased her indebtedness by Â£67,000,000. We all hope that such a gigantic addition They to our liabilities will never be witnessed again. Had there been an adequate increase in our population, that increased indebtedness might have been justified. But what do I find? That in 1861 the population of Australia was 1,153,000; during the next ten years it had increased to 1,668,000; in 1881 it aggregated 2,252,000; in 1891, 3,183,237 ; and in' 1901-2, 3,773,248. Thus between 1861 and 1881 we doubled our my right honourable friend, the population; and between 1881 and 1902 we increased it to 3,773,000. But unfortuafford us all the infornately our national indebtedness per head increased in a much greater ratio. For example, in 1861 it was Â£ 9 13s. Sd -. in 1871 it had increased to Â£ 1 7 13s. n d . ; in 1881 to Â£ 2 8 ios. 9 d . ; in 1891 to Â£ 4 7 14s. i d . ; in 1901-2 to Â£ 5 5 3s. i o d . ; and in 1902-3 to Â£ 5 7 is. 5d. Thus -the burden T h a t is so. Of course upon the people increased enormously, whilst our . population advanced slowly. I would point out that in New Zealand the national indebtedness is ,Â£55,899,019; but in this connection, as in others, that country has shown a good example fo Australia by accumulating a sinking fund of Â£2,313,239. I have no means of ascertaining how that fund is being administered, or whether it is meeting with the same unsatisfactory treatment which has been meted Out to similar funds by some of the Australian States. But what is our position in Australia? As against our enormous indebtedness of Â£222,000,000 we have a total sinking fund of only",18,Council Of Finance

81,Mr Knox,"Certainly . As the TreasÂ£2,139,021. I do not wish to differentiate between the States, but I fail to discover' any evidence that their sinking funds have been properly protected. My object in quoting these figures is lo support my statements in regard to the enormous task which will have totoeundertaken by one authority, that authority being either the Commonwealth or the independent tribunal which I propose. There is only one other set of figures-affecting as it does the constitutional powers of the House-wit h which I shall trouble honourable members. I have already pointed out that the total indebtedness Â£222,000,000. The loans existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth totalled Â£198,722,854, all of which can be taken over under the provisions of the Constitution. Upon the 30th June, 1903, the ""new "" loans which can be taken over by the Commonwealth only after an amendment has been effected in the Constitution, or, provided that the States unite in requesting the Commonwealth to adopt that course, amounted to Â£2*4, 000,000 odd. Subject to correction by legal members of the House, that is the position as I understand it. be much more simple. would be more difficulty in securing unanimity in favour of the adoption of that course. Strange to say, if the States debts are taken over as a whole, there need be no consideration as to individual inhabitants of the various States-and this is where the inconsistency comes in-becaus e if we decide to take over only a portion of the enormous debt we are bound to do so on the per capita basis of the population of the respective States. complex that I may be pardoned for quoting a few words from my own memorandum on the subjectThe effect of this limitation does not appear to have been f u l ly realized by the framers of the Constitution, for the indebtedness per capita at per State is so unequal that considerable amounts must remain with the States; otherwise, the per capita capital obligations, and per capita interest payments would be quite unfairlv apportioned as between the States. Moreover, the rates of interest vary, and the 'per capita incidence would be also unequal and unfair. propose to pay interest on loans on a per capita basis? debts were taken over? the Treasurer will agree with me, that we can never arrive at an equitable basis for the transfer of States debts until we have had an actuarial report of the position of the debts at any one given date, and at, say, a 3 per cent, rate of interest. The right honourable gentleman is aware that these loans vary considerably in respect of the rate of interest at which they have been secured. Of the total indebtedness of the States, Â£47,7.16,774 have been borrowed at 3 per cent; Â£67,216,369' of the States exceeds at 3^ per cent.; Â£89,649,503 at 4 per cent.; and Â£5,075,100 at 4J per cent. Without discriminating between the various States, f wish to show that these varying rates of interest at which money has been borrowed constitute a diversity in the claims of the different States. That is why I say that we shall never be able to equitably adjust the position without some actuarial consideration of the whole matter on some common basis. That view is unimportant, probably, compared with the future control and management of the debts, inasmuch as we are all one people and are operating for the one object. As to the new loans to which I have referred, I would point out that while the pre-, sent position of affairs is allowed to continue, without some decision as to control of borrowing, the complication of the question of the transfer of States debts will increase from year by year. Since the inauguration of the Commonwealth, the additional liabilities incurred by . the States by way of loans ' amount, as I have said, to Â£24,796,963, and there is this difficulty that New South Wales has borrowed no less than Â£13,000,000. as The matter is so against Â£11,000,000 borrowed by all the other States put-together. It must be quite clear, that as time goes on, unless there is a common authority controlling the matter on a common basis, we shall only be increasing the complications in the way of bringing about an equitable agreement as to the amount to be transferred, and the responsibility which is to be assumed by the Commonwealth Government. putting it as an increasing difficulty for the wealth. serious difficulty for the States?",19,Council Of Finance

The remaining reasons why I think that the establishment of a Council of Finance will induce the States to consent to the transfer of their d'ebts are that by the establishment of a Commonwealth authority, competition amongst the States in borrowing will be superseded by friendly co-operation and common understanding; the States will secure a highly competent central authority, fully informed and created for this great financial objective, and with a uniform policy; and, lastly, they will be represented in this authority. Let me now show the advantage to be gained by having this separate and independent Department. During the past seven months we have had as Treasurer, first, the right honourable member for Balaclava, then the honourable member for Bland, and then the right honourable member for Balaclava again. Surely, considering the enormous interests involved, whichrequire such complete knowledge and detailed management, there should be some consistency of policy. The control of so great and important a work should be placed in the hands of some one above all party considerations-som e one who would not care whether the right honourable member for Balaclava or the honourable member for Bland was the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, but would be actuated only by a desire to do the very best for the people of the Commonwealth, in dealing with all our loans. It is unnecessary for me to say that the work is one which requires to have the highest skill and ability brought to bear upon it. It is nothing like so great. the work performed by the Treasurer, as a member of the Victorian Legislature, as well as a member' of the Commonwealth Parliament; but if he were at the head of such an independent body, as I suggest, he would be in an infinitely better position than he is as Federal Treasurer. In his capacity, as a Minister, he has to attend in this House day after day to answer questions, and deal with various phases of Government business, whereas the magnitude of the special work which devolves upon him as Treasurer of the Commonwealth really demands consistent and constant attention. which the honourable member proposes to create, to be only advisory, or is it to have absolute control, independent of Parliament? That is the point which troubles I hope so, though I do not me. ter in the course of a few moments. In OTder that I may conclude my remarks as speedily as possible, I shall pass over one or two matters to which I had intended to allude, and deal with the constitution of the Council. I propose that there shall be one representative appointed by the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and also a representative appointed by the various States. I have already shown that the last-named representative could be properly appointed by a conference of delegates selected for that duty, and I have ventured to suggest that if it were possible it would be desirable in the first instance to appoint the Chief Justice of the High Court, as the highest Judicial authority in the Commonwealth, to act as Chairman of the Council. I recognise that under the Judiciary Act, that distinguished jurist is precluded at present from accepting such a position. financial authoritv. a great financial authority does not concern me so much 'at the present time as does the desire that we should have as Chairman of the Council, in the first instance, a gentleman who would be able to act in a judicial capacity in laying down the precedure as between the States and the Commonwealth.

I think that it would pay handsomely to appoint such an agent, London being our chief market. Goods might be sent to him, and their sale might be managed and controlled by him. This, and the other matters of which I speak, are subjects for the investigation of Commonwealth officials, who would obtain the latest information, and disseminate it amongst those who are engaged in our various industries. Turning to another phase of the question, I wish to say that I have experienced the greatest satisfaction from reading the publications of the Agricultural Departments of Victoria, and more especially of New South Wales, which contain a vast fund of information on a great variety of topics, and I have obtained from them a great deal of useful knowledge in regard to fruit-growing, in which I am more particularly interested. If the collection and publication of this information could be centralized and co-ordinated, it would be of incalculable advantage fo all who are interested or concerned in the industries to which it relates. A central Commonwealth Department might also deal very advantageously with new primary industries. Victoria has made various intermittent experiments in this direction, in. connection with such industries as tobacco growing, scent farming, and silk culture; but I do not think that those experiments were backed up by the latest scientific knowledge obtainable, or that the best areas were chosen in which to carry them cut. Had there been a central Commonwealth Department to give up-to-date and reliable information to all Australia, the probabilities are that new industries of permanent benefit would have been established. great deal about the wisdom and necessity of growing cotton in Australia. I have no great knowledge on the subject, though I have a sincere desire to see something done in that direction; but were I thinking of engaging in the industry I should like to be assured by such a competent and reliable authority as a Commonwealth Department of Agriculture should be, that I could obtain from it the latest information as to methods of production, and could learn how to successfully conduct my operations. I mention the cotton growing industry only by way of example, because the possibility of increasing our primary industries is almost unlimited. Silk growing is another industry which might be established here. It is a domestic industry, in a sense, and, if one may believe all that is written about it, an exceedingly profitable one, which would enable numbers of persons whose capital is limited to obtain a good livelihood. Now, the motion has been admirably debated from almost every point of view, and 1 should hardly have ventured to occupy time in discussing it had I not wished to em= phasize the need for a division of labour in this matter between the States and the Commonwealth, so that we may achievewhat we desire without friction or overlapping. I ask the House to proceed cautiously, by the adoption of some such proposal as that of the Opposition for a standing committee of trade and agriculture. an advisory board. is something more than an advisory board.

158,Mr Hume Cook,"Yes; but untilthe notion that it is only in foreign markets that we can sell our products. The Committee would do this work in a thorough and reliable fashion, and would give those who are now engaged in industries, as well as those who are thinking of embarking in them, information both accurate and scientific. We need more population, but it is utterly idle for us to endeavour to secure further settlement upon the lands unless we can assure those who settle on them that there will be a ready and profitable sale for the goods they will produce. That is, of course, a truism; but if we are to do the right thing by Australia, we shall require to attract population of two classes-thos e who are to be primary producers, and those to be engaged in manufactures and secondary industries: If this is to be done, we shall need the inter-Sfate markets of which I have spoken; but with these requirements satisfied, and such incontrovertible scientific information as this Department would collect, given to our agriculturists, we should be alble to proceed with the work with satisfaction to ourselves and satisfaction to those for whom we are about to legislate. the very admirable series of speeches which have been delivered on this question, very little remains to be said; but I have so great an interest in this subject, believing it to be the most important that, could be considererTiby the Parliament, that I desire to make a few observations in regard to it. I should like, first of all, to express think, even to those who have had no conthe gratitude I feel to the honourable and learned member for Bendigo for the manner in which he submitted the motion. In introducing it he gave not only the House, but the whole country, information of a far-reaching and valuable character, and placed'it on a plane so far above party considerations that it may be considered with no other object in view than that of the benefit of the whole Commonwealth. When tlie proposal has been brought to a successful issue, as I hope it will be in the near future, I trust that the efforts of the honourable and learned member will be remembered with gratitude by the whole of the people. It was pointed out by the honourable and learned member that it was not his desire that the Commonwealth should launch into anything like so great an undertaking as is the Agricultural Bureau of the United States of America. Although he quoted telling instances of the magnificent assistance which the bureau has given to the advancement of the United States, he wisely recognised that it would be better for the Commonwealth to found the Department on moderate lines, and to allow it to grow as the needs of the Commonwealth should direct. In the United States of America over 1,000,000 per annum are spent in connection with the work of the Agricultural Bureau, and the Federal Government do not look for any immediate return from this outlay. They realize that the value received from it filters back through so many channels-man y of them wholly unobserved-that it would be unwise, and, indeed, useless, to attempt to make any computation of the actual gain derived. I think that we can best follow in their steps if we profit by our knowledge of the enormous waste in this direction which is at present occurring in the Commonwealth. The laudable efforts made by the Agricultural Departments of the several States have resulted, and are resulting, in very substantial progress, but the saving in energy and money which would be made if the work were brought under Commonwealth authority would more than justify the adoption of the motion,, and action being immediately taken upon it. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo, in enumerating the various branches of work carried out by the Agricultural Bureau of the United States of America, dealt with them in such a way as would appeal, I nexion whatever with the agricultural industry of Australia. But I prefer rather to call attention to the good work that might be accomplished by a fusion of the forces at present operating in the Commonwealth, and to the saving of expenditure which might in that way be effected. I need only point to one matter in which uniform action would be of immense value. Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been spent within the last few years by the several States in endeavouring to secure an effective system of quarantine; but the work could be carried out to much greater advantage by a central authority. I need only allude, to the disastrous outbreak, known as tick fever which attacked' the herds of Queensland a few years ago, to recall to the minds of honourable members the enormous losses which accrued to Australia as the result of",28,Quick
159,Mr Salmon (Laanecoorie),"Afteran incomplete observance of the necessary precautions in regard to the quarantining of stock. lines were drawn by Queensland; but after the precautions laid down by regulations had been observed for a certain time, alterations in the boundary lines were made for some reason or other, and, in short, marked inefficiency was shown in carrying out what otherwise would have been a verylaudable and desirable work. ""Varying regulations were also drawn up by New South Wales and Victoria to cope with the same outbreak. fected by it in no small degree, and had to take precautions against the introduction, not only of infected stock, but also of infected hides from the northern State. dealing with this pest, there was a great waste of. effort, and even -if the Commonwealth took over only this branch, a great saving would be secured. I need not allude to the various insect pests from which the orchards and cultivated lands of Australia have suffered from time to time, nor to the different measures which have been taken by the several States to deal with them. These pests have had a marked effect upon our markets abroad, and the fruit industry, of Victoria more especially, has suffered seriously owing to the want of a proper uniform system of dealing with them. It seems to me that the Commonwealth 'Department now proposed to be created would be able to do much which individual State agencies cannot do in opening up foreign markets. We ought to have not only in the United Kingdom, but on the Continent, and especially in the Far East, accredited agents thoroughly familiar with all our branches of production, and prepared to open up markets, not for the benefit of a single State, but for the advancement of the whole Commonwealth. At present the representatives of the different States frequently come into competition with each other. We know perfectly well that when competition between commercial travellers takes place, one invariably proceeds to praise his own particular line, and to decry the products of his competitor, and such proceedings jOn the part of the representatives of the different States cannot fail to have a very bad effect upon the products of the Commonwealth as a whole. We require to send representatives of the whole Commonwealth abroad, whose business it will be not to take advantage of the misfortune of anv one State, but to endeavour to open, up markets for the producers of Australia as a whole. The honourable and From time to time, arbitrary learned member for Bendigo dealt at length with the matter of transport, and I would remind the House that in Victoria we have recently had an illustration of what may be done, and what ought not to be done in regard to transport arrangements. The Department which it is proposed .to create would undertake the work of making transport arrangements for our produce its own special care. We should then have an assurance of a regular system of transThe southern States were afport, of which aid our producers would be able .to take f u l l advantage, instead of their being placed entirely at the mercy of those who trade upon the seas. Arrangements In in regard to freights could be made much more advantageously by the Commonwealth than by the individual States. Hitherto the States which have been doing a large business with the great ocean-going steam-ship companies, have been able to secure much better terms than have the smaller States. Tasmania, for example, has not been nearly so well treated as has the larger State of Victoria, and Queensland has also had some very grave cause for complaint in this regard. Under a Commonwealth system this varying treatment would be abolished. We should have uniform rates, the producers of the Commonwealth would be placed on an equal footing, and we should get rid of 'that cut throat competition which has had such prejudicial effects upon our primary industries. There is no doubt that those who have settled upon our lands are in need of assistance. I entirely approve of the suggestion that we should endeavour to secure the settlement of a great population, provided that we take care to place the people on land which will yield them a livelihood, but I am specially anxious in regard to those who are already settled on it. We have primary producers who stand at the very forefront of their calling for laborious industry, and for the intelligent handling of their land and its products, and it seems to me that it should be our aim to assist them by giving them advice with regard to the constituents of the soil which they are endeavouring to work, and as to the products for which it is best suited. I have to admit, with deep regret, that in Victoria we have lagged far behind so far as this matter is concerned, but in Queensland a magnificent system is in force, 1 under which chemistry is brought into the very home of the farmer. An opportunity is afforded him to obtain information regarding the nature of the soil which he tills such as, I venture to say, is ngjt given in any other State in the union. I should like the Commonwealth to take up this work, and to establish laboratories all over Australia, so that those engaged in tilling the soil may be able to obtain full information as to what can best be produced on their land. I do not wish to occupy the time of the House, because I feel that we are all at one as to the desirableness of carrying this morion. interest which I take in agriculture, having been connected with it from my earliest youth, that I venture to address myself to the question. It is our bounden duty not merely to pass the motion, but to impress upon the Government the necessity to take active steps to carry it into effect. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo and those who have so ably followed him have expressed a desire that this matter should be treated as one of the very first importance. It affects every member of the community. It affects the city worker just as intimately as it does the individual upon the land, because the former is one of the first to benefit from the increased production which the adoption of improved methods of agriculture insures. The individual who resides at Port Darwin is just as much interested in these matters as is the resident of the southern extremity of Tasmania. Therefore, I feel that' the . Government should not be permitted to allow this motion to be relegated to the limbo of forgotten resolutions, but that there should be some practical outcome of this most interesting and instructive debate, in the direction of placing the producers of the Commonwealth, and those who are dependent upon them for their food supplies, in a very much better position than they occupy at the present time. There is no doubt that this motion is one of very great interest to the people of this country, because upon our primary productions our prosperity must, to a very large extent, depend. Whether the establishment of a Federal Department of Agriculture, by combining the existing State Departments, would prove a greater success than have the latter institutions themselves, is a question which can only be determined by experience. Personally, I do not hold the opinion that we always derive the very best results from centralization. If each State of the union administered its Department of Agriculture in a proper manner, there can be no doubt that the farmer would be benefited verymaterial ly. In New South Wales most valuable object lessons have been afforded the producers by the Department of Agriculture-objec t lessons which should enable them to conduct their operations in future more successfully than they have done hitherto. For example, the Government farm at Wagga, which is situated in It is only because of the deep dry country, has produced by cultivation a very much larger yield of wheat than have the surrounding farms. Upon the outside farms the wheat was sown broadcast, and weeds were permitted to grow up with it, whereas upon the Government farm the seed was sown by means of drills, and the weeds were kept down. The result was that the extra yield considerably more than compensated for the additional amount of work involved. In this way Government farms feave afforded object lessons to our agriculturists regarding the best methods of production. Of course, we are frequently assured that we need a large population, and there is no doubt that we do. If we numbered a few more millions we should not constantly need to trouble ourselves about the development of our manufactures. These would develop themselves. Our difficulty is that we have not a sufficient demand for that which we can produce, and until we secure the necessary population, we shall always experience that trouble. Sometimes I feel amused when I hear honourable members clamouring about the necessity for obtaining foreign markets for our produce, because these very gentlemen are constantly condemning the importation of foreign products. They frequently counsel the Government to send commercial travellers into the Far East, and to every other portion of the earth, for the purpose of gaining trade for Australia, and to enable us to dispose of our products there. If they understand anything about trade relations they must know that if foreign countries purchase our goods, we must be satisfied to accept their products in return. If we sell our commodities to the despised races of the East, we must import the goods of these cheap labour countries in return. I say at once that we must trade everywhere, but it is amusing to listen to the arguments advanced by some honourable members in favour of the develop-",29,Quick
160,Mr Lonsdale (New England),"ment of a great trade outside our own borders. If the individuals to whom I refer advocated the retention of all our own products, so as to exclude those of other countries, I could understand their position. Surelv they must recognise that there is only one way of obtaining payment for our exports, namely, by accepting imports in exchange. I have heard a good deal recently in reference to the hard cash which we have to pay away. of it. heard it stated that the British Empire pays away Â£800,000,000 annually in hard cash for its imports. The gentlemen who talk like that cannot understand that when England exports goods it must accept the goods of other countries in return.

We are producers of gold. or wheat, to Japan, we must accept goods from that country in return. goods. There are many ways in which the farmers can be assisted. In this connection I read two very good articles which appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of Saturday last. know everything. with the question of the advancement of agriculture. They contained extracts from scientific contributions upon the subject. One extract described how the productiveness of land can be wonderfully improved by means of bacteria. It explained that the free nitrogen of the air can be attracted to the earth by means of bacteria. Scientists have succeeded in so developing these organisms, that they can be cultivated by the farmer for the purpose of enriching his soil. As honourable members are aware, nitrate manures are very expensive, but this method of increasing the productiveness of the land is a very inexpensive one. Incidentally I may mention that a German scientist formed a company to place this product upon the I should like to see a little market, but soon ascertained that the bacteria did not successfully serve the purpose for which it was cultivated. A scientific agriculturist in America thereupon took the matter up, and.he has made of it a success. It now appears that the German scientist had treated his bacteria too well. He fed them too luxuriously, and likeall things which are being constantly supported, they did not properly discharge their functions. The American scientist, however, has developed in these proportion of organisms a strength which has added to the. productiveness of the soil in the way I have heard somethat was desired. We sometimes indulge in too much ""coddling,"" and the bacteria cultivated by the German suffered in that way. I do not know that I need say much more upon this motion. I realize that anyYet individuals like myself thing which we can do to assist our agriPerculturists, when they cannot assist themselves, is a step in the right direction. I Nevertheless, we ought to avoid any suggestion of too much ""coddling."" By so doing, we shall develop a better class of citizens.

I am quite in sympathy with the general object of the motion, but I should not care to have it thought that 'we were going to establish a Department of Agriculture in regard to which there would be a risk of our overlapping the various Departments of the States. Sir myself on that point in my opening speech, in which I urged that there should be no duplication. the Government to arrange. 'Having that always in. view, I think there pan be no harm in passing the motion. The question whether we should establish a Department, pure and simple, is a matter for detailed consideratiori later on. meantime I would strongly commend to the Government the necessity of endeavouring to make some arrangement with the States in regard to this matter, which has not been specifically handed over to us, with a view to facilitating, so far as we can, the dis. posal of our products in the mother country. pleasure in supporting the motion, which I think is a step dn the right direction. Department of Agriculture, under the control of the Commonwealth, would be in a position to afford very valuable assistance to cur farmers. have agricultural farms, by means of which information of a technical and practical character is furnished to our settlers. Of Possibly it course, the work carried on at these institutions ds of an experimental character, and no farmer could afford to carry on his operations upon quite the same expensive lines. They are of value, however, in so far that farmers can see for themselves the way in which work should be done. In the same way that in our technical schools youths are taught the right way in which to proceed about their work to saw a piece of wood, or to mark out a line-so our farmers are taught, through the instrumentality of experimental farms, . to appreciate the advantage of carrying on their operations according to the most approved methods. Whilst we are considering this subject; we must pay due attention to the fact that our farmersI speak more particularly of New South Wales-objec t to any State interference in carrying out their work. They are averse to the coddling to which some honourable members have referred, and desire to work out their own salvation. They have hewn out their own pathway to success so far, and all they expect is the assistance of the States in affording them ready and cheap access to the markets of the world. A Commonwealth Department of Agriculture would prove ot # great benefit by working in that direction. 1 I do not for a moment wish to say one word JOHN QUICK I carefully guarded against the methods adopted by the Victorian Government to encourage the dairying industry. No doubt the butter bonus gave That would be a matter for a great impetus to dairy farming in Victoria. In New South Wales, however, our dairymen, without any such stimulus, have been able to hold their own and have placed their products upon the world's markets with results quite as satisfactory as those which have attended exportations from Victoria. such a high price as that produced in New -Zealand, where the closest State supervision is exercised. a d'rastic and very beneficial Dairy Act.

I believe that the Victorian dairy farmers will take to heart the lessons taught by the Butter Commission, and adopt a similar course. An Honorable MEMBER -There is Export Board in New South Wales. Prime Minister came into office as Premier of New South Wales, he appointed an Export Board, not for the purpose of supervising or interfering with the export of produce, but with a view to opening up markets, instructing exporters as to the and cheapening freights for thenx. That board in its early days did yeoman service, but it broke down when those appointed to it were persons interested in these matters themselves. I am not a great believer in commercial agents. one case in which a commercial agent telegraphed from Japan that there was a good market there for lead at so much a ton, but when the authorities made the information known to the persons interested in Australia, they said that they -were already supplying Japan at Â£ 1 a ton more. So far as the dairying industry is concerned, such agents give no assistance to the farmers, whose produce is purchased by persons who come out here from London, and make arrangements for the supply of the home market. What our farmers require are experts in whom they will have confidence, practical men who can show them where they are wrong, and what they should do to be right. I think, however, that the motion is a good one. .There should be no interference with the farmers; but they should be assisted with technical knowledge, which they cannot obtain for themselves, for the development of their industry. Similarly, other industries, such as siik culture, which has been started on the Clarence River, and olive growing, might be assisted. A t the present time, Queensland is using for the raising of cattle land which, if it were under cultivation by intelcorrect in saying that ligent farmers, would be producing much more wealth than is obtained from it in its present stage of development. I shall support the motion. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume) -The honourable members for Cowper and New England seem to be in favour of carrying the motion, but to' be opposed to ' putting it into operation. They wish the farmers to bt left alone. Every farmer in New South Wales, however, would be glad of the information which would be available to him from the experiments of a Commonwealth Department of Agriculture. So far as I can see, the Commonwealth cannot deal with this an matter in its detailed branches without the concurrence of the States. If it did so, it would be against the Constitution; but a Federal Department of Agriculture, though the term is almost a misnomer, would be of assistance to our producers in finding markets for our produce outside Australia, and in giving them information as to the channels through which their produce could be best methods to be adopted, best disposed of. In addition, it could inform them of new inventions, and give other information which would assist them. That is what the motion has in view, and therefore it is absurd for honourable members to ride the high horse, and to say that I know of the farmers do not want anything. Some are, at times, very glad to accept seed-wheat and other assistance from the Governments of the States, and are quite justified in accepting it after the terrible series of droughts experienced; and they would be equally glad to obtain information from the Commonwealth which would enable them to increase their production of wheat, potatoes, bananas, or anything else. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo. wishes to establish a Department which will provide our farmers with information which, in their position of isolation, they cannot obtain for themselves. In Canada the work of the Federal Department extends to the work done by the States here. . It is a large Department, and does an immense amount of work. The last Prime Minister opened negotiations with the States to see if they would co-operate with us, and I hope that the present Prime Minister will dosomething more in the matter. If we have only SJtates Departments, one may act in one direction and one in another r but with one central Federal Department harmony of action can be secured. If the honourable member for Cowper is the farmersdo not require assistance, why does the Farmers' and Selectors' Association of New South Wales; which is at all times in correspondence with the Government, approach the Minister after their meetings, and ask for information and consideration ? The establishment of the Hawkesbury College, of the Wagga Agricultural Farm, of the",34,Quick
176,Mr Lee,"Yes. When the presentMurray Viticultural Farm*, and of the other experimental farms which are scattered over the State, was due to the agitation of the farmers and selectors of Mew South Wales. At present the farmers can obtain information, not only in regard to agriculture, but also in regard to viticulture, horticulture, and other kindred subjects. The farmers require all the information they can get. The honourable member for New England, speaking of the Wagga Agricultural Farm, said that it produces more than could be produced from any other farm of its size, having the same class of soil. cause the farm has been worked on scientific lines by very able men. a farmer who was just commencing tried to work his farm on those lines, he would find it very expensive at first. that he could make the Waffga farm a commercial success, and could do better with it than was done by any farmer outside. Sir WILLIAM LYNE pute the truth of that statement. be remembered, however, that that farm has now been in existence for many years. Although the soil is comparatively poor, and the climate dry' . experience has shown the r value of constant working. farmers do not plough more than once, or, at most, twice, before sowing their crops; but Mr Valder and his successor have kept the land constantly moving in order to enrich it. Furthermore, they take advantage of the new machinery which is now obtainable for the drilling in of wheat. I represent probably the largest wheat-producing district in Australia, and, -during the last election, I was interested to find on many occasions that, where there were two fields of wheat similarly situated, and with the same soil, on opposite sides of the road, the crop which had been drilled in was sometimes producing two bags an acre more than that which had been sown broadcast. The use of phosphate manures has also increased our production. I should like to remark, however, that so-called manures are being sold to our farmers which are of no value at all, and the States Governments should take the duty. steps for the testing of all manure sold, lo prevent such imposition. have been made in Victoria. still being made in this State. been brought in. Sir WILLIAM LYNE It is very necessary to prevent spurious manures from being sold, because the farmers who use them not only lose their money, but their crops and time too. so-called manures is sand. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I , therefore, would, strongly impress upon the Governments of the States the need for a thorough inspection and testing of manures. Let inspectors put their mark on manures which No doubt that is so; but it is beare to be sold to the general public. If , however, the Victorian legislation. I believe. Competition is now so keen, and the price of wheat is sometimes so low, that it is essential that our producers should get good results, and they cannot do that if they obtain useless manures, whose vendors, if they know what they are selling, are nothing better than swindlers.

During a debate in this House a few days ago, reference was made to the harvesters which are manufactured in Victoria, and which, although invented in this State, are also being made in other parts of the world. It seems to me that information that would enable the farmers to secure ""the best machinery of this kind at the cheapest rate would be of the greatest value to them. We know, as a matter of fact, that a class of harvesters which may be purchased in certain parts of the world at about Â£ 2 0 are imported to Australia and sold for something like .Â£70 or Â£ 8 0 each.

The latter has fallen into a slight error if he imagines that the adoption of this motion will be tantamount to establishing a Commonwealth Department of Agriculture. In stead, it merely expresses an opinion in favour of the creation of such a Department. It is true that the establishment of that Department will follow as a practical step upon the expression of opinion by this -House. But there will be a sufficient interval between the two things to enable the Government to get into close touch with the Governments of the different States. As honourable members are aware, one of the leading features of the proposals of the present Government is a Conference with the Premiers of the States, with a view to discussing a number of matters of mutual concern-matter s in which, in some cases, the powers of one Government overlap those of the other. sanguine that the overtures which have been made by the present Government will be received in the same friendly spirit in which they have been offered. When we speak of the "" Federal spirit "" we ought to remember that such a spirit involves a just recognition of the rights and powers of the States. Within their own jurisdiction they are just as independent Commonwealths as is the Commonwealth of Australia within its jurisdiction. point is that we should all strive to act up to it. When we use such a term as "" Federal spirit,"" it should be interpreted to mean the most cordial and friendly desire to recognise the powers of the States, and to work in harmony with them in matters of mutual concern. That has been the motive, I think, of every other human being in the universe, and I am only desirous of adding that it is the motive of the present Government. vernment. ral phrase "" every human being in the uniproposal, if they had thought fit to do so, verse.""

To the extent that I am following a and the Prime Minister. It is a motion good example. I hope that my hands will which all may join in supporting, subject to be strengthened by those who have conthe qualifications which have been expressed trolled the Government in the past. Whether rightly or wrongly, there has been a great deal of sensitiveness on the part of the Governments of the States, and a number of complaints have been made, whether ill or well founded, as to the absence of such a disposition on the part of the Commonwealth Government. I do not for a moment suggest that such views are correct, but as a practical man, my anxiety is-irrespectiv e of whether they are correct or not-to endeavour to remove them. If I thought that this motion was objectionable in any way, I should certainly advise the honourable and learned member for Bendigo to modify it. But I see nothing in it to which anybody can take exception. I accept i i as the Minister of Trade arid Customs did at the beginning of this able arid valuable discussion. The Government accept it as entirely in a line with, perhaps, the greatest work which any Government can I am very perform. It is one phase, and a very important one, of one of the most useful opportunities which can present themselves to a Federal Government. But, feeling deeply that any work of a Federal character which overlaps State jurisdiction will be imperfect unless there is a cordial co-operation between the two authorities, we should use every effort in our power to bring about that harmonious action.

It would be very interesting to follow'out the development of cases in which a similar state of affairs has existed, but I am afraid that even if we studied such valuable precedents as 'might thus be presented, we should find that, a number of features in Papua were quite different from those existing in the countries referred to. The white people in New Guinea constitute practically a white aristocracy, and my feeling is that it would not be wise to give them too much power over the immense years ahead. in that light I look upon this measure as making a start in regard to a very difficult subject, and I look forward to the time when we shall greatly improve on the Constitution provided for in the Bill.

I should like to mention the latest figures relating to the white and black population of the Territory. According to the Australian Year-Booh, there are 500 white residents in British New Guinea, and 460,000 blacks. figures, I cannot recognise the claim of the white population to any special representation which is denied to the half-million of blacks. The theory of the Ministry isand I hope that effect will always be given to it-that the interests of the black people of this Territory shall be safeguarded by a paternal Government. In maintaining our sway over these uncivilized blacks, it would be an odious thing to regard the Government as anything but their friend and protector. that it has been otherwise. which the blacks have been treated by the dominant whites, constitutes some of the worse pages in history. We can easily conceive that representatives elected by the white elite, whose business interests may often conflict with the welfare of the black races, might really form a body antagonistic to the general interests of trie population. If the few white residents in British New Guinea were granted three representatives in the Legislative Council, they would possess an enormous power. Further, the white population consists merely of birds of passage. No white man settles in New Guinea with the idea of spending his whole lifetime there. I quite appreciate the motive of the honourable member for Kennedy. ThisB ill , however, follows the lines of all British precedents in the way of colonization, and marks the first stage in an experiment which is surrounded with very great difficulty.

We know of only one instance of a lapse of judgment, which led to deplorable consequences. An emergency arose which tried the presence of mind of an unfortunate man beyond his strength, and which led to tragic results. But from all I know of the Government of New Guinea, I say In the light of these that it has been marked by a degree of humanity and consideration for the natives which will contrast favourably with any similar administration elsewhere. The spirit exhibited by the Government has always been a benevolent, paternal, and protecting one. I am afraid, that it would be unwise to give the few white residents of this Territory the proposed share of representation in the local Parliament. I am very sorry that I shall be obliged to oppose the amendment. support the amendment, but, in view of the statements of the Prime Minister, I ask the honourable member for Kennedy to modify it, so as to provide that some of the non-official members of the Legislative Council shall be elected and others appointed. I take it that the non-official members should occupy an independent position. Certainly the Legislative Council should contain some representatives of the white people. I can recall two or three places in the British Empire where there are non-official members in the local .Parliament. provided for under this B ill . by the Lieutenant-Governor, and to that extent they are not independent. It necessarily follows that their appointment must be recommended by some resident of the Territory. In order to meet the views of the Prime Minister, perhaps the honourable member for Kennedy might modify his amendment so as to provide for the election of one non-official member of the Legislative Council. It is the officials posal would involve the use of expensive machinery for the sake of one man. we should look to that individual for a true expression of the opinions entertained by the white settlers.

Similarly, at Malta there are nine non-official members who are elected by the Italian population, as against the British residents. A little time ago, when a difficulty occurred there in regard to the language question, in order to demonstrate the opinion of a majority of the people, these nine non-official members resigned their positions, and were elected again and again.

Prime Minister might very well agree to a compromise under which three representatives of the Legislative Council would be chosen by the residents of New Guinea. All that the honourable member for Kennedy desires is that the white residents shall be directly represented by some non-official members of that body. I admit that the clause would have to be amended further down, because I do not think that the honourable member for Kennedy desires that the non-official members should increase, as provided for in subclause 3, since, if they did, they would outvote the official members.

We know that there is a precedent in the Empire for the course we propose to adopt. In India, for example, native races under the Crown are not allowed to exercise the franchise as British subjects in other parts of the Empire, where there is responsible government, are able to do. British New Guinea is as yet in its infancy. It is not a State of the Commonwealth, but simply a territory on whose development we are expending a considerable sum. At present the white men in the Territory may fitly be described as visitors rather than settlers. They have gone there to see if they can make a rise for themselves, and I am rather inclined to think that in their interests, as well as in the interests of the natives, it is well that we should allow the clause to remain as it stands. we shall act wisely in passing the clause as it stands. As a matter of fact, it provides for something slightly more liberal than the usual' Crown Colony form of government, inasmuch as there is to be a larger number of non-official nominee members of the Council than is usual. of the natives will be quite as secure in the hands of a Council, consisting of members nominated by "" the Governor-Genera], and with the Commonwealth Parliament ready at any time to step in to remedy any defects, as they would be if representatives of the few white inhabitants of the Territory were elected to it. Fiji is administered under the usual Crown Colony type of government, an.1 its Legislative Council consists of the Governor and six official, and six non-official members. The Constitution with which we propose to endow British New Guinea is similar to that which all of the Australian States had at their foundation. When a colony is founded, it is granted, the Crown Colony form of government of the severe type in which all the members of the Legislative Council are nominated. As its population increases, however, nominee and elective members, in addition to the official members are returned to the Council, and finally it is granted what ds called responsible government, such as that under which we live. Considering that there are only about 250 British white subjects in New Guinea, I fail to understand why there should be any desire to introduce the elective system at this early stage in its career, and I do not think that it is necessary in tlie interest of the native population to do so. The Crown Colonies of the Em-, pire, such as Ceylon, Mauritius, the West Indies, Fiji, the Straits Settlements, and several others, are governed under a very similar system to that proposed in the Bill, and no one would say that in Crown Colonies the interests of the natives are not safeguarded. On the contrary, the complaint is often made that they are safeguarded to too great an extent, and that the white population do not receive theconsideration they deserve. I think that the proposal to introduce an elective system of representation into the Government of this Territory in the early stages of its career would be regarded as rather Quixotic. Local residents will be recommended to the Govern or-General for appointment to the Council. We may be sure that proper inquiries will be made before any appointment is made, and that the gentlemen nominated as members will be largelv interested in the development and progress of the Territory. I therefore see no reason for taking exception to the clause. port the amendment, which embodies a proThe interests posal that I voiced in the last Parliament. At that time, in view of the limited information at oiir disposal, it was considered that it would be unwise for us to concede this measure of self-government to the white settlers of the Territory ; but. upon inquiry I feel more .strongly than before that the proposition is a sound one. The white population of British New Guinea consists mostly of miners and traders who are really pioneers developing what no doubt will become an important part of the Commonwealth. These persons have been trained in the exercise of the powers of self-government in the States from which they come, and we need have no fear in granting theni a power which they have already enjoyed.' I believe that the interests of the Crownand of the natives are amply safeguarded by the Bill. There is to be a Legislative Council, consisting of six members, nominated, in the first instance, by the Lientenant-Governor, .and approved by the Governor General.

The objection has been taken that it would be very difficult to secure such an expression of opinion on the part of the white settlers as would lead to their being fairly represented. objections that have been mentioned. the Government regard that objection as a trivial one, because in the last Parliament it was considered a very serious objection. I agree with the Prime Minister's view, because wherever there is a fair population it will be just as easy to take a poll, as it is in our back-block districts. fetched. is. I have never visited New Guinea, but those who have assure methat no more difficulty would be experienced in taking a poll in the mining centres there than in the back blocks of Australia. those living in isolated districts, why should we not permit them to vote through the post, just as we allow settlers in, the remote parts of the Commonwealth to do? abused. It seems to me that.the white settlers would do their utmost, to secure the proper expression of their views at the ballot-box. Until the population of British New Guinea exceeds 2,000 it would be impossible under this proposal for them to exercise any greater voice in the management of the affairs of the Territory than they would, at the present time. It is provided that for every increase of 1,000 in the population after the limit of 2,000 has been passed one additional member shall be elected, until a total of twelve representatives shall have been returned. When that stage is reached the white population will probablv be large enough to warrant some alteration of the Constitution. view of the fact that there is no insurmountable difficulty in the way of securing a vote of the people, I think that they should be given some opportunity to select the men who are to specially represent them. injury would be done to the native population; on the contrary, it seems to me that their interestswould be more likely to be JOHN FORREST -They are not all safeguarded by a Council constituted as the honourable member for Kennedy proposes than they would be by a purely nominee Council. object which the honourable member for Kennedy has in view is a very good one, and I think it can be substantially obtained under the system provided in the B ill . H is object, in so far at it tends to independent representation in the Legislative Council, is a good one. I would point out, however, that the object of having non-official members is not that we may secure some echo of the official members. If that were the principle of the Bill it would be a mere waste of effort. The principle underlying this proposal is that these non-official members of the Legislative Council shall really be different from That is rather farthe official members in the sense that they will to a greater degree represent the non-official elements in the community.

That will be one direct hold which the House will have upon any Government which may bring this Bill into operation, or exercise any powers under The system might be this particular section. It will be the constant desire of the Government of the day here, and I think also of the Government in Papua, that .the non-official members shall, in the fullest and highest possible sense represent the best independent elements of the community. We have many methods of attaining that end. For instance, the Lieut -Governor cannot make an appointment under the Seal, of the Territory, except with the consent of the Governor General, who will, of course, act under the advice of his Ministers. Therefore, it will be the duty of the Government of the day to see that the three non-official members are of the class that the honourable member has in view, and that, I think, we all desire to see recognised in these appointments.

If this were a business concern some of these keen spirits might make the best kind of directors; but in view of the paternal Government we have in view, we must impose some check upon the kind of men who are returned. In a constituency of this kind, very limited, and with strong conditions of selfishness surrounding its enterprises, it would not be impossible for some person to be elected who would be the last man my honourable frieivl or any one else would desire to place in such a position. I submit that we have a far higher duty to the 500,000 blacks in Papua than to the 50O whites. The latter can look after themselves much better than the blacks can.

I have no official information relating to .the matter, but a book recently published under the title of Sunshine and Surf, and written by Mr Douglas Hall and Lord Albert Osborne, makes some reference to it. This book describes a cruise among the South Sea Islands, and the statements made by the authors can be regarded only as ex parte declarations of tourists.

The present Governor decided that the six Government officials were bound to vote with the Governor pn any measure which he might bring forward, thus one can see at a glance that, as he ihas a casting vote, with his six satellites, he can carry any measure for taxation or for the spending of the revenue he chooses.

F i j i as we do about Papua. Papua and F i j i will be entirely different, because we shall have the whole of the Government under our immediate observation. At some future time it may be advisable to proceed upon the lines proposed by the honourable member for Kennedy; but, at present, I am sure that his scheme would be absolutely impracticable. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) The Prime Minister has assured us that the appointments to the Legislative Council will lie made upon a principle very different from that followed in connection with appointments made up to the present time; but the whole administration of Papua has been so unsatisfactory ihat I think some radical change should be made. I have had scores of letters from miners, who state that the conditions there are very far from what could be desired. who go to Papua resort there for the purposes of personal gain; but at the same time they are performing valuable development work, which is not likely to be undertaken by anv other class of settlers. But in doing that, they incur an enormous risk. It is that risk which makes it possible for others""to subsequently settle there, and to live in comparative comfort. Under the circumstances, I think that these men should receive better treatment than has IO Q been meted out to them. I can assure the Minister that the mining population of British New Guinea is very much dissatisfied with the manner in which the administration of the Territory has been conducted. One'of the principal things of which they complain is that a little band of residents who are located around Port Moresby practically controls the whole island. Whilst all sorts of concessions can be obtained by settlers in the vicinity of that port, the miners who desire that pathways should be cut to the different mining centres-and honourable members must recollect that the jungle of New Guinea is almost impenetrable-experienc e great difficulty in getting their requirements attended to. When it was proposed to take over .the administration of this Territory, I voiced the opinion that we were embarking upon a Papua is very very dangerous course, inasmuch as we were undertaking the control of 500,000 blacks, some of whom are of a very warlike disposition. I quite agree with the Prime Minister, that the black residents of the Possession should be protected in every possible way, and I trust that the scandals which have occurred in connection with the treatment of Australian aborigines willnot be repeated there. The way in which our own natives have been treated constitutes one of the blackest pages in our history. In the northern portion of Queensland they have been shamefully treated. .treated there at the present time. MrM c DONALD I will not say that. The Queensland Government has done a great deal to alleviate their sufferings. But whilst we should protect the natives of New Guinea, we should also encourage our white settlers to develop its resources.

That fact evidences the necessity for having the white population in a Crown posal in the B ill practically amounts to this : If the Governor is dissatisfied with the action of any member of the Legislative Council, he may remove him at any time.

If it could be shown that a nominee Council would safeguard the interests of the blacks better than an elective or partially elective Council, my position would be different; but our experience in Australia has been that the blacks have suffered the greatest amount of injustice, not under representative government, but under a government similar to that which is proposed for New Guinea.

310,Mr Reid,"That is so. The principlemay have. There is the further guarantee that Papua is not like the form of Crown Colony with which many of us are familiar. It has been suggested, for instance, that the ment? Lieutenant-Governor might immediately dismiss any official member of the Legislative Council who crossed his path. There is absolutely no foundation for such a suggestion. The Lieutenant-Governor will not be able to dismiss an officer unless the -Governor General-and that means the Governor General and his' Ministers-ap proves of his action. will be able to disn.iss a man on the recommendation of the Lieutenant-Governor. and the Lieutenant-Governor are two different persons. In this Territory, unlike the old type of Crown Colony, where the Governor was a sort of despot, who could do as he pleased, it will not be possible for the Lieutenant-Governor to appoint a single Officer without the approval of the Australian Ministry. Under the Bill there is not one official whom the Lieutenant-Governor will be able to remove. He will be able to suspend an officer, just as the head of a Department might do, but the case must ihen be submitted to the Governor General in Council, with cause shown for the action taken. The Governor General in Council will then decide whether the man is to be dismissed or not. I think that honourable members will see that we are keeping a fairly close grip, after all, on the working of this experiment, and in a way which is unknown in any Crown Colony with which I am familiar. statement made by the Prime Minister as to the position of the white and coloured races in Papua reminds one of the situation in India. India has a population of some 350,000,000 coloured British subjects, and 1 I doubt if there are as many hundred thousand whites to be found there; but neither the white nor coloured races are allowed to exercise the franchise. We know, however, that in two small districts in the peninsula -Chandernagore , and Pondicherry-whic h belong to France, the people have the privilege of electing a member to the ChamBer of Deputies, and the Senate in Paris. I mentibn ithis only as. showing that one European nation, at all events, allows representatives to be elected in respect of a -small part of the peninsula of Hindustan, whilst 350,000,000 highly civilized human beings in the main part of the peninsula, are not pem.itted to exercise the franchise. white settlers in Papua should have representation. something more than that; it says in effect that the whites shall exercise half the power of the Legislature-60 0 whites against half-a-million blacks. position. have: some measure of representation, but unless the number of members be increased from three to six, they will not be properly represented.

I would point out, however, that sub-clause 2 provides that the appointments shall be made by the Governor General, under the seal : of the Commonwealth, or by the Lieutenant-Governor in pursuance of instructions from the Governor General. If these instructions are of a general character, and are issued immediately the Bill is brought into operation, any subsequent Governments will be relieved of the responsibility .for the directions given by their predecessors. I should like the Prime Minister to consider the advisability of amending the clause by providing that special instructions shall be given in every case. 'In that event, the Government of the day will be directly responsible to Parliament for any action that may be taken.

No intoxicants or opium shall be allowed admits that he does not know the number to be imported into or'manufactured or sold or otherwise disposed of in the Territory except for medicinal purposes to be disnensed on the order of a medical practitioner, or person duly authorized by the Lieutenant-Governor, and any ordinance passed before the commencement of this Act providing for such introduction or sale is hereby repealed. I have considerably altered the scope of the clause since it was last submitted to the House. When the Bill was before us last session, it was provided that no intoxicants should be sold except for medicinal purposes on the order of a medical practitioner, but honourable members will notice that I now propose .that liquors shall be dispensed by a medical practitioner ""or person duly authorized by the Lieutenant Governor.'"" I desire to direct attention to the objections raised by Sir Edmund Barton upon a' former occasion, and also to the information gleaned by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat from residents in Papua. Sir Edmund Barton, in opposing the clause which was previously agreed to, laid special emphasis on two points. In the first place, he stated that a considerable 1 loss of revenue would result from the prohibition of the sale of liquor, and, in the second place, pointed out that the precautions taken to prevent the sale of liquor I to natives had proved thoroughly effective; and that no real danger was to be appre-J hended. He directed attention to the fact that the ordinary licensee was allowed to sell liquor only for consumption off the premises, or for consumption on the premises by bond fide residents in such premises, and that the conditions were such as to preclude the natives from obtainingliquor. He represented that the loss of revenue would amount to something like; Â£s> &3> and said, further, that there were 2 fourteen licensees to meet the requiremnts of 500 white people. The opinions expressed in the paper laid upon the table, which gives the answers to a series of question submitted to residents of the Territory by the honourable and learned n.ember for Ballarat, were offered in respect.to the clause as it was embodied in the former Bill, which precluded any one but a medical practitioner from dispensing spirits for medicinal purposes. The evidence of the missionaries was particularly based upon that restricted provision. I would direct the attention of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat to the fact that some of the statements made are of the most remarkable character. of licences issued. of putting it. words. He saysI regret to say I am not yet in possession of the results of the Government Secretary's inquiries as to the number of licences in force. They are granted by the Resident Magistrate in each division, but no general record of them has been kept at head-quarters. Therefore the Administrator has so little control over the issue of these licences that he knows practically nothing about them.. The statement that there are only fourteen licences is proved to be wrong, because there are actually twenty. A further remark is made by the Acting-Administrator to the effect that if the proposed prohibitionbe carried out neither missionary nor miner on' the gold-fields will be able to procure a bottle of spirits to alleviate pressing sickne-.s except on a certificate from a medical officer, and he points out that there is only one medical officer at Port Moresby, and another at some place far removed from the gold-fields.

Barton also stated that, no retail licences were issued, and that no intoxicating spirits were sold, except in bottles, for consumption off the premises. The Acting-Administrator states, however, thatYour Excellency will have observed that Section IV . of ""The Liquor Ordinance of 1S91"" does not authorize what is generally known as a "" bar trade,"" but such a trade seems to have been permitted, and the hotels at Port Moresby and Samarai and the stores in the more remote places sell liquor by the glass under the licence granted them. This shows conclusively that the conditions demned, all the missionaries agree that if of the licences at present issued are being prohibition could be made effective it would evaded, and that liquor is being sold apbe in the best interests not only of the parently without any restriction. Now let natives, but of the white residents. me quote the opinions of some of the missionaries, to which great prominence is given in the papers laid before the House. The stainers ? Bishop of the Church of England Mission saysThe laws dealing with the sale of alcoholic liquor generally have been observed, so far as the authority and influence of the Government officers have extended, but there are stores on better for them and for the cause which the gold-fields, and at least one township where they desire to serve. Another remarkable at times no officer is present, and then excessive objection which is urged by the missionaries drinking has been resorted to. The present unrestricted sale of alcoholic liquors, bringing large ' is that they cannot get wine for sacramental gains to the vendor, or to the licensed victualler, purposes. One would really think that the or storekeeper, whom he represents, needs immetime had gone by when such an argument diate attention. It has led to unchecked orgies, would be advanced. Why, there are thouwhich have disgraced and lowered the white race in the eyes of the native, and while the 'state of sands of churches all over Christendom in Samarai in this respect has greatly improved durwhich non-intoxicatingwine is used for ing the last five years, in more remote places sacramental purposes, and many others in disgraceful scenes have occurred more recently. Another missionary saysThe morals and health of the white community and natives would probably, as a whole, be slightly improved, but members of the former would perhaps be driven to dishonest, acts to procure spirits. The fear is expressed by most of them that liquor will not be obtainable for medicinal purposes, and their objection is based upon that ground. They agree that the mora^ and the health, of the people will be greatlyimproved. Another missionary remarksThe laws of the Possession arrange for bottle licences, and forbid liquor to be drunk on the premises where it is sold. This prohibition is universally disregarded. liquor is sold by licence has a bar at which it is drunk. Sir Edmund Barton made a strong point of the fact that the native residents could not obtain drink except for consumption off the premises, and' stated that there were no licensed houses in the sense in which we understood the term in Australia. Another missionary testifies thatNatives have undoubtedly obtained drink. The Sir Edmund sources at present are : the stores, private individuals (whites), hotels, and Kanakas. I don't think that natives get it from the stores with the knowledge of the storekeepers. Private individuals are not always careful to lock up their whisky bottles. Hotels have, it is supposed, supplied Kanakas, with or without permit, secretly. It will be impossible to safeguard the supply to natives unless Kanakas are placed absolutely on the same footing as the Papuan, and the sale of drink taken over by Government, and no licences issued to private individuals, t Although prohibition on the lines indicated in the clause as previously adopted is conwhich no wine is used whatever. I recognise too well the value of missionary work to say one word which would reflect upon missionary sacrifice. But I cannot refrain from' declaring that the whole of the evidence which is advanced by the missionaries in this Parliamentary paper is about upon a par with the statement to which I have referred. Then again, great prominence is given by the missionaries and the officials to the question of revenue. I should like to direct the attention of the Committee to the fact that this matter was recently discussed in the New Zealand Parliament, which found it necessary, in the King Every place where country and Cook Islands, to absolutely prohibit the use of intoxicating drinks except for medicinal purposes.

Continuing, Mr Seddon is reported to have saidThere were, during the year 1901-2, 4,271bottles of spirits consumed at the Cook Islands amongst less than eighty whites, including Chines: and women and children. The women and children number thirty. This, added to 11 respectable quantity of wine and beer, is a bad record.

At the same time, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that the picture that is frequently drawn of the cbr.dition of things in the King countryand especially if we compare it with other similar places, where licences exist-is over-drawn. I go to other places where there are a number of natives, and where there is a licenced house, and almost any time. I go to these places I see more evidence of native drunkenness and demoralization round about the licenced houses than I have ever been able to see on any visit to the King country. It is true t'hat the police and the magistrate have done their duty as well as possible under the law they have to operate, but it has to be remembered we have never had applicable to the King country the same law that is applicable to districts where no licence has been carried in other parts of fhe colony. orable member quoting? land Hansard. The same speaker proceededThe condition of things existing there will be very greatly improved by the adoption of the clauses in this B ill , or the provisions applicable in other districts, where no licence has been carried. It will thus be seen that provision is made for supplying liquor only for medicinal purposes. In urging that we should not grant responsible government to the white residents of New Guinea, the Prime Minister declaredthat their business interests might very possibly come into conflict with the interests of the native blacks. I quite agree with him, and I claim that it is apparent from this document, that the interests of the storekeepers of New Guinea are regarded as of infinitely more importance than are those of its black population. control New Guinea, the honourable member would not secure teetotalism there. examined this parliamentary paper, I say that the case for prohibition has been very much strengthened. It is patent thai the 1 licensing conditions are being evaded, and that liquor is being retailed to the natives. I contend that we ought to discharge our duty to these people. Like the honourable member for Parramatta, I do not think that it matters very much whether we develop New Guinea or not. It is of importance, however, that we should not carry and ruin them in the same way that we have ruined the Australian aborigines. We should absolutely prohibit the sale of intoxicants in the Possession except for medicinal purposes. the Committee will sympathize with the object of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports in submitting this amendment.

Then he must watch a coastline of 3,600 miles, f u l l of bays and estuaries..

The stricter our supervision, the higher would be the p-rice of the alcohol to the men who had the gold-dust to pay for it, and the more they would pay for smuggled drink. In these circumstances, what would be the result of amending the clause as proposed? It would not only lead to the natives being set an example; which they have not hitherto had, of white men defying the law, but would make it worth the natives' while to assist them to defy it. defy the law in this respect. and there, who is not under control, defies the law at the present time. If we passed this amendment we should have practically the whole white community intriguing through the natives for surreptitious supplies of smuggled alcohol, and should run a greater risk of demoralizing the natives of Papua by the liquor traffic than by any other means we could adopt. My opinion on the subject is worth nothing. repeating the evidence which has been expressed to me by magistrates, missionaries, and representative miners in Papua. They all tell the same story. They all admit that it would be absolutely impossible to prevent smuggling. We have not such a staff there, nor could we maintain such a staff as would be necessary to prevent the practice. The miners will have the liquor, and if we decide for prohibition, the only result will be to sacrifice revenue, and compel them to smuggle their supplies through the natives, instead of obtaining them, as at present, from the whites at Port Moresby. On behalf of the natives, and in their interests, I would emphasize the views that have been expressed by representative and independent men in Papua. I consulted no persons interested in the liquor traffic, but many others, including-total abstainers, and in every case the verdict was that .there was a much smaller risk to the natives now than would result from the encouraging of smugy-i'ig. It must be remembered that in Papua there is a penalty for supplying any person who is not a European with alcohol. Alcohol must not be supplied, either to .the natives of the country, or to any Kanaka, Malay, or other native who.may be brought there. liquor at the present time: Â£ 2 0 0 and six weeks' imprisonment may be imposed for supplying alcohol to persons other than Europeans. the Kanakas are continually being supplied with alcohol. not to Kanakas living on the island, but to those who fish off the coast and occasionally put in there. There are practically no Kanakas resident in the Territory. This is not a question of having to weigh reason against reason, or fact against On l y in isolated cases. fact. The whole weight of testimony secured by me is that it would be impossible to carry out this proposal. That is whyalthough I am. in sympathy with the object which the honourable member for Melboune Ports has in view, and would naturally wish to be on the same side with himI find it my painful duty to oppose his proposition. Having gone into the question thoroughly, I feel it my duty to speak as decisively as I now do against the amendment, and' to wash my hands of all responsibility for what will be the consequences of carrying it.

His arguments against it are that he fears, first of all, that if the sale of alcohol in British New Guinea were prohibited, there would be a considerable loss of revenuejection of all. learned member says that if we do not allow alcohol to be sold there, smuggling will be sure to take place. Assuming that his argument be correct, the loss of revenue which this proposal would involve would amount to only Â£ 3 , 0 0 0 per annum. The honourable and learned member, however, has forgotten to put the other side of the question. He has quite overlooked the fact that as long as we continue to allow alcohol to be sold in the Territory, we shall be put to the expense of "" policing "" the islands, and maintaining gaols. We have heard a great deal to-night about the coloured races, and I think it is as well that we should pay some attention to the position of the white settlers in the Island. If the 600 white settlers consume the whole of the liquor which, according to the official returns, is annually introduced into the Territory, I can only say they are the thirstiest individuals of whom I have ever heard. We are told that the liquor is conveyed to the Territory in schooners, and I am inclined to think that the white settlers there must drink it in "" schooners."" In 1902-3, the 500 white residents of New Guinea consumed 1,600 gallons of whisky, 800 gallons of brandy, 140 gallons of gin, 600 gallons of rum, 300 gallons of bottled beer, 4,200 gallons of draught beer, 1,000 gallons of wine, 64 gallons of sparkling wine, and 290 gallons of other liquor. There is a fine liquor bill for 500 whites. If the people of Melbourne and suburbs had the same drinking capacity to the square inch as honourable members would have us believe the white residents in Papua possess, the shares in brewing companies would be of much greater value than they are at present. traders obtain theirsupplies of liquor at Port Moresby and other ports in Papua. of the Opposition he describes Papua as a distant island which no one ever visits, but now he would have us believe that it is a I should rather be speakplace of call for thousands of people who require to replenish their stores of liquor. I should prefer to see He will next tell us that it is' in New Guinea that the Japanese procure their extra supplies. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that 100 traders called at New Guinea every year, and obtained supplies of liquor, that would bring up the number of white consumers to 600. Even though the average consumption were in that way reduced by one-sixth, I cannot conceive it to be possible for such a small number of persons to consume such a large quantity of liquor. iThe white population in Papua require a little protection at our hands. We should endeavour to break them off the excessive ""drunk"" in which they have apparently been indulging. I do not know whether their excessive drinking habits are due to the climate or to malaria, or whether they are accounted for by the fact that some of the more thirsty souls from Australia have gravitated there. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat said he did not like the idea of doing anything that would be calculated to encourage smuggling or ill i cit distillation. But the arguments used by the honourable member might, with equal force, apply to the circumstances of every State in the Commonwealth. "" I can assure the honourable and learned member'that he would be astonished if he knew of the large quantities of illicitly distilled spirits which pass down the throats of liquor consumers in the Commonwealth. This is not so much due to dishonesty on the part of hotel-keepers as to malpractice by brewers and wine and spirit merchants. I am not a professional teetotaler in the sense that I belong to any temperance society, but I have from conviction been a total abstainer for many years. Still, I have a very good idea of the drinking capacity of the average man, and I feel convinced that the small number of white residents in Papua could not consume the quantity of liquor imported into that country. The only conclusion at which I can arrive is that a large proportion finds its way into the possession of the natives. You, Mr Chairman, ardently supported the honourable member for Melbourne Ports when he made a proposal of this kind on a former occasion, and I heartily wish that you were in a position to assist us in fighting the opposition which is now being directed to the proposal before us.

If we permit the natives to obtain liquor, and their taste for it is cultivated, we shall have great trouble with them, and will probably have to incur very heavy expense in maintaining order among them. We have, at various times, heard a great deal with reference to temperance reform, and I believe that if we could make our people more temperate we should effect a great improvement in their condition. The leader of the Opposition, and those honourable members who support him, profess to be very anxious to elevate the masses, and they could adopt no surer means of bringing about that result than that of making them more temperate. We now have presented to us an opportunity of experimenting in Papua, and if we adopt the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports we may be in a position, within a short time, to point to that Territory as a glorious' example of the benefits of prohibition. I have much pleasure in supporting the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and I trust that the Committee will repeat -the vote which it recorded upon this matter upon a previous occasion. The only reason which has been urged against the adoption of the proposal is that it will be difficult to give effect to it. But I would point out that the same trouble, is experienced upon the mainland to-day. Smuggling is rife upon our coastline. Some honourable member with a fair degree of mathematical skill has calculated the consumption of whisky, brandy, and gin per head per annum amongst the population of British New Guinea. -.these figures, but they prove' incontestably :that the bulk of the liquor which is consumed there is not consumed by the white population, but by the black.

I anv as thoroughly in sympathy with the good object of the' honourable member for Melbourne Ports as anybody can be ;but I confess that the weight of the evidence which has been collected from all sources is so overwhelming that I cannot see any possible-justification for the amendment which has been submitted. It is urged that the proposal is made in the interests of the natives themselves. That would be a most serious matter to consider if it were necessary to do so. But the evidence which has been obtained from every conceivable authority in New GuineaI do not propose to detain the Committee by making a number of quotations-show s that there is absolutely no abuse in the consumption of intoxicants by the natives of New Guinea, except on the part of a few ""pearl fishers. The great mass of the natives of the Territory indulge in no sort of traffic in spirits, and the laws which are in force in the Possession are absolutely effective. Testimony to that effect is borne by a cloud of witnesses, including missionaries and storekeepers. The District Committee of the London Missionary Society, at a special meeting, dated 16th March,"" unanimously passed a series of resolutions for the consideration of the Commonwealth Government having reference to the liquor laws. These refer to the subject of prohibition, with the general principle of which many of the missionaries agree. I shall quote the final sentence of those resolutions. It reads thusWe are resident in New Guinea solely for the well-being and good of the natives, and in their interests, and for their sakes, we wish to deprecate the passing of this lawThat is, the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne PortsI do not propose to quote proposal then. proposal, because it is intended to supetsede the local ordinance by an amendment in the direction of prohibition.
