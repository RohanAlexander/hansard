Prime Minister promised that a Royal Commission would be appointed to investigate the base metal industry, and particularly the merits of the ease of the producers. I wish to know if anything has been done towards appointing the Commission, and, if net, what is proposed to be done? to me to fall within the category of those which could be placed on the notice paper, and I shall be glad if-the honourable member will give me notice of it. General, upon notice1. How many official post-offices were there in Victoria in 1901? 2. How many inspectors were there employed ? 3. How many official post-offices were there in 1919? 4. How many inspectors were there employed ? 5. What are the salaries of inspectors? 6. What are the salaries of postmasters at Geelong, Bendigo, and Ballarat? 7. Is it within the province and duties of the inspectors to criticise and report upon the work and duties of the above-mentioned postmasters ? 8. Isi t departmental!/ considered satisfactory that a lower-grade officer who may be an aspirant for ahigher-grade position should report upon the work of officers holding higher positions in the Service? fl.

If so, will the scope of"" the Commission's inquiry include the Bureau established at what used to be the model lodging-house, No. 211 Kent-street, Sydney? 3. What unions (if any) will have representation on this Commission? 4. Will the members of the whole of the unions comprising the Transport Workers Federation be permitted to appear and give evidence before the Commission? honourable member's questions are as follow:1, 2, and 3. Steps are now being taken to appoint a tribunal to inquire into the conditions of the Sydney waterside workers with a view to effecting a settlement of matters in dispute on similar lines to those adopted in the case of the Melbourne wharf workers, including provision for-(a ) preference for original loyalists; (6) preference for returned soldiers; (c) equality of opportunity for employment for all others. It is proposed that the"" tribunal shall consist of one representative of the ship-owners, one representative of the Waterside Workers' Federation, and an independent chairman, to be selected by the parties by mutual agreement, or, in the event of disagreement, to be nominated by the Commonwealth Government. 4. The tribunal will decide concerning who shall be allowed to be represented before it, and as to who shall give evidence. SALE : RE-SALES AND DISBURSEMENTS: ister, upon notice1. What is the total amount for (1) interest, and (2) storage on the wool held on account of the Imperial Government by the Wool Board? 2. Wihat is now the cost per day of these two items? (3) In what proportion are these costs borne by the growers and the Imperial Government? honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. It is practically impossible for the Central Wool Committee to compute the total amount chargeable to the Wool Pool for (1) interest, and (2) storage, without particulars of the quantities of Australian wool stored in England and other countries, the quantity of wool afloat, also the carry-over wools from auction sales. All these factors are changing daily. The British Government's financial year ends 31st March,' when detailed statements will be furnished by the British Government's auditors. 2. The cost for interest on, and storage of, wool in Australia alone is approximately £5,000 per diem. 3. As all costs are debited to the Wool Account in the preparation of a balance-sheet, it follows that His Majesty's British Government and Australian wool-growers bear such charges in the proportion of ,50 and 50, with, to Australian wool-growers, a guaranteed minimum of 15Jd. per pound of wool on a greasy basis, plus f.o.b. charges at Australian ports. upon noticeT h e answers to the 1.

I will have a statement prepared setting out the agreement arrived at originally and subsequent variations, together with the other information asked for by the honourable member, and I will lay the document upon the table of the House. notice1. Having reference to a statement made by the Treasurer on the l l t h of July last (see Hansard of that date) that "" action had been taken by the Government for recovery of moneys due to the Commonwealth and the Central Wool Committee by the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, and that a writ had been issued against the company on the 1st of March, 1919,"" was the case ever set down for trial; and, if not, why not? 2. What is the total sum of money received by the Government in connection with the agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company? 3. Are any moneys still due to the Commonwealth by the above company; and, if so, how much? orable member's questions are as follow:1. No'; the pleadings are not yet closed. The defendants delivered their statement of defence and cross action on 19th February, 1920. 2. £88,987 10s. 9d. In addition, the sum of £357,808 9s. 5d. has been paid by the company into trust accounts at the Commonwealth Bank, Sydney, to abide the result of the litigation now pending. 3. This question cannot be answered until the litigation is at an end. WAE PRECAUTIONS ACT. upon noticeWill the Minister inform the House of the date when the War Precautions Act ceases to operate? mated, in reply to a question asked in the House by the honourable member for Capricornia on Friday last, that the War Precautions Act will cease to have force and effect at the expiration of three months after the issue hy the Governor General of the Proclamation specified in section 2 of the War Precautions Act 1914-1918 declaring that the war with Germany and Austria-Hungary has ceased. COST OF LIVING AND BASIC WAGE : SECOND ister, upon notice1. Will he take steps to pay the cost of living award to members of the Public Service immediately? 2. Has he looked into the Statute regarding Public Service awards, with a view to bringing them into operation when Parliament is not sitting? 3. Has he considered the increase in the cost of living in New South Wales, with a view to increasing the salaries to Federal public servants within that State, so as to bring their salaries up to the basic wage? honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The cost of living bonus recently awarded by Mr Justice Powers cannot be paid until the fulfilment of the statutory requirement that an award shall be laid upon the table of the House for thirty days before coming into operation. 2. The action suggested by the honourable member would involve taking away from Parliament the power which it at present possesses of disapproving the operation of an award, and would necessitate an amendment of the Arbitration (Public Service) Act. I am looking into the matter to see how far an amendment of the Act is possible. 3. Commonwealth Public Service awards are Federal awards, and the Arbitration Court will not fix differential rates for any one State. Dr. EARLEPAGE asked the Prime Minister, upon notice1. Isi t a fact that the granting of the second period of furlough to Commonwealth public servants has been approved? 2I f so, is it now possible for an officer to secure the second period? 3. If not, will the Prime Minister make it available at the earliest possible moment? honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The Government has decided to introduce a Bill to amend the Public Service Act in the direction indicated by the honourable member. 2 and 3.

It will be supplied as soon as available. 6. The necessities of the case of the Commonwealth being at war, and the action taken being for the safety of the Commonwealth, made it inadvisable for the action suggested in the first part of the question to be taken. In the case of natural-born internees, internments took place after submission to the Cabinet, and with regard to naturalized subjects of enemy origin, on the decision of the Minister for Defence, after consideration of all the facts. Internees' cases were reconsidered from time to time, and, where the position justified it, releases were made. Subsequent to the Armistice, a release commission was appointed to consider doubtful cases referred to it by the Minister, and make recommendations to the Minister, such recommendations receiving consideration on the line of policy laid down by the Cabinet, and consequent decision arrived at and action .taken.

44,Mr Hughes,"Certainly .Since the adjournment on FridayI have had the opportunity of inspecting in the Adelaide Advertiser and the Adelaide Register reports of what is supposed to have taken place here on Friday, when the House was good enough to give me leave to continue my remarks to-day. Speaking of myself the Register saysHe considered that before it began to consider the propriety of the war gratuity, the House should have some explanation of what he considered reckless and extravagant expenditure. The Advertiser uses these wordsHe considered that before they began to consider the propriety of a war gratuity in a Committee of Supply, they should have some explanation of what he regarded as reckless and extravagant expenditure. I refer to these reports in order to correct a wrong impression that has been allowed to be conveyed 'to these papers, because every honourable member knows that, in the course of my remarks on Friday, I made no reference whatever to the question of the war gratuity. I did not suggest that there should be any postponement of the time when a measure should be passed in order to authorize the payment of that gratuity. In fact, it did not enter into consideration at all, and if the Government had thought fit to call Parliament together earlier the necessary B ill for the authorization of the payment of the war gratuity could have been passed long ago. So far as I am concerned, I shall give Ministers every assistance to have the passage of the measure facilitated. To-day I do not propose to deal with many matters that could very properly be discussed before agreeing to the Government's proposal to go into a Committee of Supply. quite a long list of incidents that have marked the career of the Ministry, incidents which the public, I am sure, are very anxious to have explained. might go back to the Ready incident, and to the occasion on which Mr Jensen, the ex-member for Bass, was gazetted out of the Ministry, or to otlier matters of a similar k in d ; but in the course of my remarks I do nob propose to deal with such things. as I can see at present, seen fit to give us the opportunity of turning out the present Government and cleaning out what I regard as a kind of Augean stable in connection with many matters affecting the administration during the past three years-indeed , during the-whole of the Ministry's term of office; but, no doubt, on some future occasion we may have an opportunity of discovering something in the pigeon-holes, or, at all events, of giving some one else the chance of making the necessary investigation. For the present I am mainly concerned with matters that appear to me to be of extreme urgency as affecting, not only the present, but also the immediate future. No one can suggest that the situation is not a difficult one. I do not suggest that the task before the Government is easy. There is a great burden of debt, largely increased, as I pointed out on many occasions, owing to the failure of the Government to have a proper regard for the interests of Australia during the course of the war. I believe that our debt is anything between £100,000,000 and £200,000,000 over and above what it would have been if the Government had had a proper regard for those interests. I form that opinion by a comparison on a population basis of the expenditure in curred by Australia w it h ' that incurred by Canada. However, there are some"" matters of immediate concern with regard to the expenditureof the Government, and also with regard to the profiteering which has been allowed to become rampant in the community, and I propose to occupy a few minutes this afternoon in dealing with them. It is entirely in the hands of honourable members to compel the Government to adopt a policy suited to the requirements of Australia, and to enable it to meet its great obligations. We have the power to do so. The question is whether we are going to exercise it or not. So far, One might go back over I have not had the opportunity of seeing exactly where honourable members stand with regard to such a policy, but I realize that if the Government will not conform One to what a majority of honourable members in this House consider to be in the interests of the country it is the plain duty of that majority to t u r n them out of office. When I was speaking on Friday last The electors have not, so far I made some reference to extracts from the Melbourne morning dailies relating to certain contracts for shipbuilding. Since then I have had the opportunity of perusing the report of the Auditor-General",24,Government Commissions And Com Mittees Wheat And Woolsales Cornsacks
45,Mr Ryan (West Sydney) [3.22],"with regard to these particular matters. I find on page 252 of his report a reference to an agreement made w i th the Patterson McDonald Shipbuilding Company, Seattle, on the 22nd June, 1917, for the construction of ten first-class wooden cargo-carrying steamers for 5,300,000 dollars. The Auditor-General writes thatextra payments had been made to tlie extent of 500,000 dollars in connection with these steamers. From a file of papers placed at my disposal by the Prime Minister's office, it appears that the original contract was amended, on the 18th December, 1918, to provide for the payment to the shipbuilding company of 8,200,000 dollars, subject to a deduction of 200,000 dollars reserved to cover displaced machinery, as it was intended to provide five of the ten steamers with Diesel engines instead of steam engines. I call special attention to the next sentence^From the papers, it appeared that there had been considerable misunderstanding on the part of the contractors with respect to some of the of the honourable member who has just terms of the contract, and the Commonwealth interjected, but he seems to be taking up Commissioner, acting under the authority of the Commonwealth Government, made conthe cudgels on behalf of the Government. siderable concessions. I should like to know from the Prime Minister and Attorney-General( Mr. Hughes) what led to "" considerable misstrumentalities of the profiteers. understanding on the part of the contractors."" Here we had a big contract jector, let me say that these are only illusmade by.the Government for the constructrations of a general looseness of expendition of a number of steamers, involving ture on the part of the Administrathe expenditure of a large sum of money tion. a contract which should have contained very definite and specific provisions, such than that. as would not lead to any misunderstanding. And yet we find the Auditor-General is much worse. I am merely referring to pointing out in his report that there was these as instances indicating a general "" considerable misunderstanding on the looseness. part of the contractors w i th respect to some of the terms of the contract, and that respect of the American ships exceeded the Commonwealth Commissioner, actthe contract price. ing under the authority of the Commonwealth Government, made considerable concessions."" I object to the Government One finds this .report of the Auditormaking indefinite contracts that are open General teeming to misunderstanding. It is not businessthe like, to say the least of it , and it should Government not have been necessary to make concesa couple of illustrations that w ill sions with regard to these contracts.

It is pointed out that the cancellation of a contract made with the Walof the Audit-Inspector of the 17th December, lace Power Boat Company Limited, of Sydney, shows a loss to the Commonwealth of £51,839 2s. 7d.; that the cancellation of a contract made w i th Hughes, M a r t in, and Washington Limited, of New South Wales, shows a loss of £72,500, less the progress payments that had already been made; and that the cancellation of a contract with Kidman and Mayoh, of New South Wales, shows a very large loss.

Some correspondence was seen in this matter, but no written authority was viewed for the sales. Papers are said to be at the Attorney-General's Department. It is stated that the Prime Minister, Mr W. Hughes, authorized the sale of the motors to Thompson and Company at cost price, on representation being made that they were to be used for the purpose of commencing the manufacture of motors. The munitions people say that a verbal agreement was made that the motors were not to be sold. The cost price was very much below catalogue prices, and from what can now be ascertained, catalogue prices of the motors soon became below the market price. It is further stated that the firm of Thompson and Co. were unsuccessful in manufacturing motors at payable prices, and obtained permission to sell at prices fixed by the Munitions Department, a stipulation to that permission being that the difference between the purchase and selling price is to be held pending a decision as to the ownership of same.

The latest report shows that this question is still unsettled, and also that the ""motors were re-sold in some cases at big advances on the purchase prices."" This matter has been brought under the special notice of the Treasurer. Before we go into Committee of Supply we shall, perhaps, hear something from the Treasurer ( MrW a t t ) as to what he 'has done in regard to this matter. All I can gather from tbe report is that it is alleged that the arrangement was made verbally, yet we are told that there are papers in the Attorney-General's Department. These papers are not forth coming, and the Auditor-General speciallv called the attention of the Treasurer ( Mr Watt) to the matter in order that he may investigate it . There may be some explanation, but one would have thought that if there be a satisfactory one, it would have been given before now. Another illustration of the Government's wasteful extravagance is given on page 301, paragraph 121, of the Auditor General's report121. Excessive cost of steel purchased hy Small Arms Factory -In March, 1918, an Audit Inspector reported that on 17th December, 1915, Messrs. 13. K. Morton& Co., Sydney, offered a quantity' of high-speed steel, "" Maximum"" brand, to the Small Arms Factory, Lithgow, at 4s. 6d. per lb. The Factory accepted this offer on 22nd December, 1915, and placed orders for the steel with this firm. B. K. Morton and Co. purchased the steel from the -Poldi Steel Company for £1,907 2s. 9d., sold it to the Small Arms Factory for £3,384 9s., and thus made a profit of £1,477 6s. 3d. on the transactions; and in the file it is stated the only expense incurred by B. KL. Morton and Co. was for cartage. The report goes on to show that the steel was to be of what is described as the "" Maximum"" brand, but the steel that was delivered, or some of it , was not of that quality, with, the result that Morton and Company had to make a ref u n d . The. Auditor-General winds up with this commentThe Factory should have purchased from the Poldi Steel Company direct, and thus avoided -the exorbitant charge made by B. K. Morton and Company. If time permitted, I could give illustration after illustration of the reckless exThe penditure of the Government, and that is a mild term, because some of these transactions are open to a more sinister suggestion. I particularly refer to what is said in the report, page 257, in reference to secret service expenditure, but I feel it quite unnecessary for me to go further. I have said enough to show that the charges I make against the Government are well founded-unbusiness like methods, injudicious expenditure, and wasteful .extraviagance.,' But, penhaps, the greatest indictment that can be laid against the Government is found in the report of the Economies Commission, which was appointed by the Government. There wasalso, I might say, a Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the administration of the A r m y and Navy, and a general perusal of the reports of these Commissions shows that there are very grave defects in the policy pursued by the Government. So far as I can observe, no steps are bqing taken by the Government to remedy those defects. We all believed that when the wax was over, the expenditure in the Defence Department, at least, would be reduced to something like pre-war proportions, if not something lower. Instead, however,",26,Government Commissions And Com Mittees Wheat And Woolsales Cornsacks

There has been no talk of applying the War Precautions Act to the operations of the companies I have mentioned. They have been allowed to raise their rates and fares as they liked, and the public have been bound to pay what has been demanded of them, or forgo the service. tions Act does not apply to the operations of these companies. not allowed under the Act to raise their rates and fares. these companies, and the incidents I have mentioned show the way in which it is being applied to them, we have conclusive proof that the Government has allowed the companies concerned to make the profits that I have mentioned. I thought that the answer of the Prime Minister would be that the Government had not the power to prevent profiteering, but I gather from the interjection that they have been applying the War Precautions Act, and that what has happened has been the result of applying it with a favorable leaning towards the big shipping companies and other combines. Not only has profiteering been allowed in the case of companies such as those that I have mentioned, but it has been allowed to the real detriment of the primary producers of Australia. I should like to know all about the transactions of the Government in regard to the sale of our butter; all about their transactions in regard to the sale of our wheat; and all about the sale of our wool. From reading press reports published during the electoral campaign, I learned that a very prominent member of the Country party-the honourable speaking at Camperdown-the report is from the Age of the 20th November lastsaidButter was sold for export at 175s. per cwt., while second-grade butter was shipped to the East at 205s. The fixed wholesale price in London was 252s. per cwt., and, as 13s. covered all the expenses, the equivalent on the London price was 230s., a difference of £64 per ton against the dairyman. member's statement that the profiteers were in the Nationalist party, and were finding the funds of that party ? bers of this House beside those sitting on These are the Opposition benches have very clear views regarding the attitude of the Government towards profiteering. There are on the cross benches on the Ministerial side of the chamber honourable members who know as well as we do that the Government are in power because of the assistance they received from the profiteers; and the question that the country The War Precauwants to have decided, and the question that we should decide, is this: A r e we going to allow the Government to carry on administration, and to propose legislation in the interests of the profiteers ? Of course, the members of the Country party must be the judges of what they shail do, If the Act applies to but I have no doubt that if they see the position, as we see it , they will bring about an alteration of the present state of affairs. The contract regarding the wool clip seems to be very vague. I should like to see the document itself; or the cablegrams, if the agreement was made by cable. gins has said that there was no contract. negotiations which led' up to an agreement which gives half the excess profit to the British Government. Why does not that profit go to the Australian producer, or why is it not used to relieve him of taxation, the wool being an Australian product? I desire some explanation of these things. I wish to know why the Government allowed trafficking in wheat scrip. Many of the small farmers were seriously hampered because the Commonwealth Bank did not go to their assistance, and l e f t them at the mercy of ' speculators, so that they were bound to sell their scrip at prices which did not give them a fair return for their labour and expenditure.

I have no doubt that Ministers are prepared to give a guarantee, because I know the Prime Minister of old, and that he would promise anything. When the conscription proposals were before the country, he asserted that he would not continue in office if they were turned down, and yet he d i d . When the last referendum proposals were before the people, he said that if the Government proposals were not carried, some one else would have to be obtained to lead the Government; yet he is still at the head, of affairs. doubt, he is capable of giving a guarantee regarding the Government's policy in the future, but what is needed is evidence that effect will be given to any such guarantee.. If we take the experience of the past, we know that guarantees have been given by the Government without any serious intention of giving effect to them, and merely to enable Ministers to hold on to office. It is a remarkable thing, in view of the circumstances confronting the people of Australia at the last election, that the present Ministers still occupy the Treasury bench. Yet the reason is not far to seek. It is tliat the big capitalistic and profiteering interests were prepared to spend tens, and hundreds, of thousands of pounds upon a campaign of misrepresentation, to enable Ministers to remain where they are. Some prominent members of the country party were very outspoken in regard to this matter during the election campaign. The honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) , speaking at TaturaI quote the Age report of the 14th November-said Mr Hughes and his party were being assisted in the election by profiteers, and they realize our duty, we shall compel the Gowere not likely to fight them. I agree with that. Then the honourable member for Corangamite, speaking at Camperdown-doubtles s with ample evidence of the truth of his statement, as has expired. otherwise he would not have made it said_ The National Federation was an organization of vested city interests, drawing a colossal ing of a reply from a Minister. fighting fund from the manufacturers and Flinders-lane.

Those profiteers could has been said by a prominent member of be shot with a short-range gun from an upthe Opposition. Those of us who were Mr Ryan. stairs room in Parliament House; but they were not likely to shoot the goose that laid such golden eggs. That statement commends itself to me. The reports of the Melbourne daily press of the evidence that is being taken by the Royal Commission now investigating the subject of the basic wage show that the people referred to by the honourable member are actually passing on their income taxation to the consumers. No Government which allows that to be done has any right to remain in office for more than forty-eight hours. No eight hours? to look through their pigeon holes. The war has cost Australia much blood and treasure, and has put a great burden of debt upon the whole community. The National Government have the power of taxation. They can say by whom, and in what amounts, taxation shall be paid. They have complete defence powers in t cluded in which is the power to say who shall pay for defence. A r e Ministers going to allow this passing on of taxation to continue? They have allowed it to go on for some years, so that wealthy corporations, instead of being worse off as a result of the war, have passed on their taxation to the consumers, and are better off. These companies publicly admit the facts. Surely every one ought to be a little b it worse off because of the war; but these big companies are better off. Persons whose salaries are fixed are not able to pass on their taxation, nor is the wage-earner able to do so. But the Government have allowed a system whereby the consumer is charged high prices which throw on him the whole cost of the war. If we vernment to prevent that from continuing.

76,Mr Fenton,"I think there is noin the last Parliament know something of the shipping contracts that have been alluded to. The Prime Minister, travelling to Europe by way of the United States, apparently discovered at Seattle a Yankee firm which was prepared to build wooden ships for the Commonwealth, and I believe without consultation with the Cabinet-entere d into a contract with that firm. I have no wish. t to say anything disrespectful of those whom we term our cousins, but I believe that the Yankees are sufficiently shrewd to make as many dollars as they can out of a deal. They could see in the so-called shrewd Prime Minister of the Commonwealth one who would be a willing tool, and would not hesitate to enter into a contract to enable them to make very many dollars in a very little while. One pleasant feature of this shipping business is that Australia narrowly escaped incurring a considerable expenditure, through the agency of the Prime Minister, in respect of the purchase of a fleet of concrete vessels. This transaction would have been typical of Mr Hughes. He was out to . impress the world, and would embrace any new idea which might be set before him at that juncture. Honourable members in the corner opposite are, no doubt, deeply Concerned in this matter. Then there are the wheat, wool, and butter, and other Pools besides. When the whole story of these Pools shall have been told the primary producers, who are lamenting even now. will be still more deeply sorrowful. Regarding the Wheat Pool, we have heard of certain discoveries as the outcome of investigations in New South Wales; the loss of millions of bushels of wheat has been reported. I do not wish to refer to a matter which is, in a sense, under legal investigation at this moment; but the remarkable disclosures in regard to transactions in New South Wales indicate what would assuredly come to light if similar investigations were undertaken in Victoria. The farmers of this State would then learn that they, too, had lost millions of bushels of wheat. Without doubt millions of bushels have gone somewhere. We have heard something recently of the Black Hand, and of various 'other nefarious kinds of hands"". Some hand has been operating -in this State, behind M i nisterial .and official authority, and that hand has delved deeply into the pockets of [6] the people and robbed them, probably, of many thousands of pounds. There will presently be a further opportunity for honourable members to enter upon a full-dress debate, when I hope that the sins of the Government will be exposed to the public, and that that exposure will have such an effect on the minds both of the people and of certain honourable members who have been sent here pledged to support the Government, that there will be no hesitation in voting out of office the present occupants of the Treasury bench. The outcome would be one of the best possible things that could happen to this country, for there would follow a better, cleaner form of government than Australia has known during the past four or five years. I desire to inform the House that it is my intention to move, in CommitteeThat the proposed sum be reduced by ' the amount of £2,803,500. order, whether it will be competent for the honourable member to move in the way he has indicated, seeing that the motion before the House is that we go into Committee for the purpose of granting Supply?

In certain of the big business firms operating in Queensland special 6taffs are required to do nothing else but attend to land and income tax forms, State and Federal. ( Mr Watt) has stated that there would be a saving of £3,000,000 per annum if there were but one system of taxation. there is sufficient justification for the Government to take action. Here we have a new Government, just returned to power by the people, and we learn from them of the certain annual saving of £3,000,000 of the taxpayers' money. The Government are aware of the position, but they are making no effort, and have promised none, to bring about reform. We know that the present methods are' rotten. me use that word; it is vulgar. Australian word, and the Treasurer knows exactly what it means. What effort is he making to persuade the Government to bring about a system of uniformity? In the past, State and Federal taxation officials have put their heads together. to consider the matter; but they have expressed the view that reform could not be brought about. not the Government compel a giving way ? If the sum of £3,000,000 annually could be saved, the reform is one upon which the Government should enter without an instant's hesitation. Almost every taxpayer is yearly confronted with a multiplicity of obligations in respect to land and income taxation schedules. year I myself was fined in respect to the Queensland land tax. It appears that I had returned a form in which I had answered a list of queries, and had been under the impression that I had sent in my schedule. I was fined-and rightly so, I suppose-althoug h quite innocent in the matter. As for the experiences of land-holders, I speak feelingly: One has quite enough to do in looking after his actual business responsibilities without being harassed with numerous and different taxation forms. The Government, however, are proceeding along the same old lines, although they very well know there is urgent need for action. This is no party matter. I dare say that the individuals who would be chiefly benefited are my political opponents. Nevertheless, I have no hesitation in pressing for fair play and a big saving.

Y o u have never heard give him the opportunity to do so. It is a good honourable member think that the Government have had sufficient opportunities in the past? If they still refuse to move, another course of action must be taken; another Government must be put into office. There is one other subject in which State and Commonwealth services are involved, and in regard to which the people should be given relief. Either the Commonwealth Savings Bank or the State Savings Banks should be closed. The Government should bring in legislation in order to authorize the continued existence of only one Government Savings Bank, and not two. In my own State there are in numerous centres two offices and two staffs.

It is time that something was done to lessen the difficulties which the men, women, and children in the remote parts of Australia have to encounter. I feel confident that the Government are going to -do something in the direction I have suggested, and believe that the Postmaster-General( Mr Wise),'as the representative of a country constituency, will take the matter in hand. I do not want something for nothing. The people whom I represent, knowing the position of the finances of Australia, do not ask the Government to spoon-feed them. They are quite willing to pay for their various services; but it is a bit hot to ask a few men to construct at their own expense a telephone line extending over several hundreds of miles and then to charge them for the use of it. Some friends of mine asked the Postal Department for permission to erect a telephone line, but could obtain no satisfaction. When they appealed to me for advice, I said, "" Shove up the line. Take no notice of the Government or any one else. When the line is constructed, the authorities will not make you pull it down. They may write a number of letters to you, but when you receive them put them in the fire, and that will be the end of the matter.'' That advice has been followed in more than one instance. The manager of a station owned by the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) was much concerned as to what be should do in regard to the construction of a certain telephone line. I advised him to pnt it up Tegardless of the consequences, and when he told me that he feared that the authorities might ""get to him "" afterwards, I replied, "" Put up the line, andleave it to Jowett, who is in Melbourne, to settle with the officials.""

I have no desire to go over the whole ground covered by the honourable member for Maranoa, but I wish as strongly as possible to emphasize the enormous disadvantages and burdens associated with the present dual system of Commonwealth and State income and land taxation. I should not have risen at this stage, but that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) stated that the Treasurer ( Mr Watt) had said that the cost of collecting the double land and income taxation of the Commonwealth and the States amounted to something like £3,000,000 per annum.

I had intended to move the adjournment of the House on the matter, but I find that I can deal with it on the question before the House. During the last week something like 200 men have been dismissed from the Factory. I wish it to be thoroughly understood that I have no desire to see the services of these men retained if their work is of .no value; if these men cannot justify their existence, I have no desire to advocate their claims. It has been shown to the DefenceD e p a r t I understand that further retrenchment ment, however, that there is a means by which the whole of these men can be successfully employed in the manufacture, not only of rifles, but of various other articles, which I shall presently enumerate.

Directly those notices were shown, I got into communication with numbered 182, of which there were 98 married the Minister Pearce), and accompanied a deputation to number of these married men have as many as him from Lithgow in regard to the posiAve, tion.

According to a report of the deputationSenator Pearce then went on to say that he would interview the military authorities as to quire for the present financial year, and when he had obtained this figure, he would see whether it would absorb the entire output of the Factory, and when he had ascertained this he would then endeavour to try and secure money I for the probable extra orders. In the meantime, he asked Mr Leighton to send instructions to the manager of the Small Arms Factory to cancel the notices of leaving that had been issued the day before, and no more dismissals were to take place until the manager received special instructions. Senator Pearce said he expected to put the matter before the Cabinet next week, and expected to have a decision by the following Thursday as to whether it would be possible to give the Factory a further grant of money to enable them to carry on with their then present staff. He also asked the deputation to assure the employees that he was doing everything possible to keep them employed, as he was in full sympathy with their claims. In addition to the dismissal of these men, is to take place, affecting an additional 200 or 300, over a period of possibly four months.

130,Mr Nicholls (Macquarie) [ 5 . 0 ],"have spent all their money, and find it practically impossible to leave the place. We have to consider that Lithgow has been placed in a more unfortunate position than many, other country towns, in asmuch as it suffered very seriously from the influenza epidemic, and the men feel keenly the responsibility that has been placed on them by the Department. As I said before, if it were a question of manufacturing rifles for the purpose of keeping these men in employment, I would not advocate such a course; but the deputation placed a proposal before the Minister to the effect that they should be permitted to manufacture telephones and the whole of the appliances necessary for telephones, typewriters, sewing machines, crank cases, and' various parts for motors and cycles, the whole of the tools necessary in the Public Works Department, and scores of other commodities. The Minister for Defence, however, having had some experience of a similar proposition, did not feel inclined to entertain it . We cannot, however, get away from the fact that the whole of the steel, and iron, and other material necessary are at hand, and the Factory certainly ought to be able to manufacture such articles just as cheaply as they can be turned out in other portions of the world, and at a smaller cost than that at which' they can be imported. All I ask at present is that tlie Minister for Defence will stay his hand for the time being, for if he will give those men an opportunity to consider their position everything will be all right. If the men are permitted to commence the manufacture of the commodities I have mentioned, I venture to say there will be no necessity for further retrenchment, as the Factory will be utilized to the fullest possible extent. Lithgow presents better opportunities for their manufacture than do most industrial towns in Australia. The Factory is equipped with perfect machinery, well adapted for turning out other things than rifles.. The Pearce) stated that it was a question of money and economy] but, if that be so, why did the Minister not commence operations' with the Arsenal money is not there to pay wages, the staff of the Arsenal would suffer in proportion ; but that is not the case. Earlier in the afternoon, during this debate, the Auditor-General's Mr NicholU. and' I noticed one portion of it which affects the Small Arms Factory greatly. I shall read the extract so that members may be able to decide for themselves whether economy was studied or not. The report saysExcessive cost of steel purchased by Small Arms Factory -In March, 1918, an Audit Inspector reported that on 17th December, 1915, Messrs. B. K. Morton and Company, Sydney, offered a quantity of high-speed steel, "" Maximum"" brand, to the Small Arms Factory, Lithgow, at 4s. 6d. per lb. The Factory accepted this offer on 22nd December, 1915, and placed orders for the steel with this firm. B. K. Morton and Company purchased the steel from the Poldi Steel Company for £1,907 2s. 9d., sold it to the Small Arms Factory for £3,384 9s., and thus made a profit of £1,477 6s. 3d. on the transaction; and in the file it is stated the only expense incurred by B. K. Morton and Company was for cartage. In fulfilment of the orders, largo quantities of steel of the brands OOOX and OOOX Extra were supplied by the firm, and paid for by the Factory at the price agreed upon for ""Maximum steel."" Tlie Audit Inspector, in April, 191S, found a large quantity of the steel in stock with the bars clearly stamped with the brands, ""Maximum,""' OOOX Extra, OOOX. It was stated the substitution of the lower grades of steel OOOX Extra and OOOX, was not noticed at the Factory, and the steel was brought to account in the stock records as "" Maximum"" steel. The Treasury was advised of the matter in May, 191S, and on 9""th January, 1919, B. K. Morton and Company refunded an amount of £324 5s., being a rebate of 9d. per lb. on 7,456 lbs. of OOOX Extra steel, and of Is. per lb. on 893 lbs. of OOOX steel. The Factory should have purchased from the Poldi Steel Company direct,.and thus avoided the exorbitant charge made by B. K. Morton and Company. The following are extracts from the Defence file in regard to the matter :"" The firm disclaim any wrongdoing in connection with the matter, but are agreeable to make the refund as above-mentioned."" "" The whole transaction is one which justifies the doubt which has been expressed as to whether everything has been open and above board."" "" There is no evidence to show that any undue influence or bribery has played any part in connection with the transaction."" From that extract it would appear that a quantity of steel was purchased by the Small Anns Factory at an exorbitant Minister for Defence (Senator price. Hoskins and Company have an establishment within a mile of the Small Arms Factory which is capable of manufacturing the best steel that the world staff?

On the mainland the States are in regular contact with each other by means of the railways; the mails are despatched each day, and the passenger traffic is maintained. The Government seem to accept the obligation of continuing that intercourse, and I maintain that they have a similar obligation to insure that Tasmania and Northern Queensland, which rely upon water transport, are kept in regular communication with the other portions of the Federation. The people generally in Tasmania feel that they_ are being neglected. Having had a long experience in this Parliament, I know thab honourable members do not wilfully and knowingly neglect Tasmania, but I find it very hard to make them understand the peculiar position of that State. The fact that it is separated from the mainland by water creates special problems and conditions which do not apply to otlier States. I am sorry that the members of the Federal Parliament do not visit Tasmania more often; if they did so, both their health and their intellect would benefit. In fact, it would pay the island State to invite members of the Federal Legislature to go across in batches and learn first-hand the resources and disabilities of the State. A t present I find it of Commonwealth vessels by the Tasdifficult to make honourable members grasp Tasmania's exceptional position, and in order to get a fair deal for that State one has not only to speak in the House, but to "" buttonhole "" honourable members in the lobbies and elsewhere.

If the shipping companies would not guarantee not to send away their vessels the Customs authorities could be in structed' not to grant clearances which would permit vessels to go to other parts of the world to be sold, or to engage in trade to the detriment of the Australian producer. The sooner the Government relinquishes its control of shipping the better it will be for every one. vernment has been ill-advised in controlling vessels under 1,000 tons which were not within the area of the recent strike. A vessel called the Timoru was chartered by a firm to carry Tasmanian produce, but' some one-probabl y a discontented person who was aggrieved because he could not get space on her for his goodscomplained to the Comptroller, and the Comptroller took possession of the vessel. Immediately he did so, the engineers left it, and the steamer has been tied up in Sydney Harbor almost from that day to this. fered she would have done something to relieve the congestion of produce in Tasmania. know what have been the difficulties of crossing the Straits during the strike, and how hard it has been to get produce away from Tasmania.

Tasmania great quantities of produce for I supported them which there is a good market in New South Wales, and a 4,000 or 5,000 ton vessel such as the "" Austral"" boats bought in London by the Prime Minister might occasionally be put into the Inter-State trade. Of course, if these vessels are better employed in transporting produce overseas,. I have not much of a case, but the suggestion ought. to be considered. Under those cirWe should be told why some of these vessels are not being used for the InterState trade.

I myself have urged that special consideration should be shown to those in the country. The GoEvery district suffers, and cases of hardship like those mentioned by the honourable member are frequent.

144,Mr Atkinson,"Yes. There are inGovernment to take the right and proper action in this matter. I should like to give the House the impressions of a new member, though I do not inteud to talk at length, because one feels that much speaking doth confuse great issues, and that iD Parliament it takes a very long time to do a very little. I am a member of a party that believes in sound government, though I do not say that members of other parties do not also do so. The rural community of Australia does not like party government, and showed that by abstaining for nearly nineteen years froni seeking separate representation in this Parliament. expected others to give the country sound government, and have now been forced by circumstances to create a political party to voice their views and needs. With a national debfeof nearly £700,000,000, the whole of our time can .well be spent in getting to the root of matters. We advocate economy without the impairment of efficiency; we agree with the Prime Minister that the only way in which we can meet our national obligations is by doing more work, and by producing more. According to Mr Knibbs, the people in the country, who number less than half the community, produce three-quarters of its wealth. therefore, a right to be heard regarding the national expenditure. The members of the Country party do not claim to be the only members representing the producers. presenting rural areas have promised to support measures for the encouragement of primary production, and to make country pursuits attractive. They meant well when they made those promises; but they were attached to some party or other which had its centre in the congested portions of Australia. They were caught in the whirlpool of that power which was associated with Capital and Labour. They were overawed and overpowered. they dare not vote against the Government and put them out. Ofttimes they were given a little sop to allow the producer to go on with his business; but the very fact that centralization continues to thrive, notwithstanding that every party in this House proclaims the principle of decentralization, shows that nothing tangible has been done. Evidently those who have proclaimed decentralization have [5.42] merely preached, and not practised. It appears, then, that in respect to that which the Prime Minister regards as most important, namely, the stimulation of production, something has been left wanting. This little party in the corner feels that, concerning those matters to which the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr James Page) has alluded, little time or attention need be spent in putting things right."" For every party agrees that those savings which can be effected should be speedily brought about. I refer to such matters as the duplication of offices beThey tween State and Federal Governments. Why should people of the same race and country, speaking the same language, be called upon to render distinct and separate forms of taxation returns? Have we not sufficient intelligence to ask the taxpayer to make out only one form for each phase of taxation, so th,at his taxes shall be assessed, and the amount involved rendered by him without vexation? Of course, it will be said that the one Government has not been able to agree that the other shall have control. But that is a very small thing. Surely, where the people of this country are so closely concerned, and when we are so "" hard up Their representatives have, against it "" financially, we should give swift consideration to these straightforward methods of effecting economy. Some primary producers would almost rather go to gaol for a month than make In the past, members reout their taxation returns; whereupon they proceed to an accountant or an actuary to have their returns drawn up for them. This individual does a little profiteering upon the producer, so that the latter often pays more to have his liability ascertained than is involved in the actual amount of taxation required of him. Governments of the past do not seem to have taken into consideration the tremendous expenditure which falls upon the shoulders of the primary producer. Shackled by partyism, When we are called upon to contribute money for the maintenance of the country, the operation should be made as simple as possible. The transference of our taxation quota should be as direct and effective as can be possibly devised, and the channel, of transference should be made as economical as possible. Has that channel been as economically de-",42,Mcwilliams Then I Do Not Have Put Up Hundreds Of Miles Of Tele
145,Mr Prowse (Swan),"signed and maintained as it might have been? under either Federal or State control, be appointed and empowered to collect taxes on behalf of both authorities? The same line of criticism may be applied to the Electoral Departments. In stead of keeping two staffs for the compilation and maintenance of the rolls, could not one staff easily and effectively do the necessary work for both Federal and State authorities? And the same applies to the statisticians of the States and Commonwealth. I am perfectly satisfied to take such statistics as I require from Mr Knibbs and his staff. To build up separate departments for State and Commonwealth statistical purposes strikes one as altogether unnecessary. On one other matter I also thoroughly agree with the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr James Page). Much sympathy has been extended to the poor "" cookie,'' the pioneer on the land. orable member for Maranoa would make a very good Country party man. ideal member of this little corner party. He pictured the privations and disabilities of the people outback, and who, nevertheless, are called upon to provide guarantees before certain public services are rendered them. Yet we were appealed to by the head of this Oovernment, before he went to England, to produce more. Mr Hughes has returned, and again he has said that the only way out from under onr tremendous burden is to produce still more. Can further production be expected of people when they are actually called upon to furnish guarantees for the rendering of services which are given freely to the inhabitants of the centres of population? How can one compare the national services of those who are favoured by three -and four and five postal deliveries daily with those of the men and women of the "" outback,"" who are fairly beneath the burden with which the Commonwealth is weighted today, and who are asked to be content with a postal delivery once a week or fortnight? There must be more generous consideration if we are to encourage rural industry-if we are to make rural production more attractive. That great I m perial agriculturist, Sir Rider Haggard, was asked to give the Commonwealth a message, and he said that the chief aim Cannot some Commissioner, of the Governments of all highly civilized countries should be to keep population on the land, to encourage those modest rural homes in which men and women grow up in health and prosperity and become endowed with those sober and enduring qualities which have made the greatness of our nation and maintain it to-day. Honourable members of this House have evidently scrapped Sir Rider Haggard's message. In Victoria alone, it appears that the population of the whole State has increased, during the nineteen years of Federation, by 196,000 persons; the increase of population in Melbourne for the same period has been 200,000 odd! That indicates a distinct and alarming decrease in rural production. Doesi t suggest that the lesson of Sir Rider Haggard has been really learned? I intend, at a later stage, to deal more fully with the population statistics of the Commonwealth, and to stress the general decrease of the rural population, concurrently with the marked 1 increase of the urban population. It isa matter which must be regarded seriously by the Government. No wonder that the sons of our rural settlers are nolonger finding country occupations attractive! They no longer care to undertake the tilling of the soil-whic h they have been asked to carry on as their duty. And' there is no lack of patriotism inferred thereby. The fact is that decentralization is being merely preached, 1 and neither practised nor assisted. In the season 1914-15 the wheat-growers of Australia planted 12,000,000 acres. Last year they planted only about 8,000,000 acres-a n astonishing decrease in a brief period. Can such facts afford encouragement to the Government, faced as they are by an enormous national burden of debt? In asking for the practice of economy, I am conscious of the tremendous load with which we are now weighted. I am cognisant of the huge amount of money represented in the individual share of the national debt. It is a greater sum than was borne by the United Kingdom prior to the war. In the case of the British people, however, there were 45,000,000 of them, the wealthiest in the world, and having the finest financiers on earth amongst their citizens.

I said a moment ago that other parties would pass on the price of commodities to an unlimited extent, but that is not to with the producer; particularly is it impossible in regard to that which he produces for export. The rural producers have said "" Amen"" to the claim of other sections of the community for the maintenance of a white Australia, but the policy has 'brought to them an obligation that has not yet been removed from them hy subsequent legislation. The fact is that the white Australia policy and the maintenance of it protects every other person in the community but the primary producers. ""Walls of tariff have been built by the joint effort of labour and capital, and as a result the man who makes harvesters or ploughs seems to get on very well indeed. .He can bring up his price to the waterline of the protective duty, and makes a' nice little thing out of it. labouring men approach him through the Arbitration Court and say, "" OUT party voted for that Tariff; we think that we should have some of the advantages."" The manufacturer says, "" Certainly you ought to,"" and, therefore, through the Arbitration Court, the request is granted. The net result is that the ""cockie"" pays them both, but has no means of passing it on. The Country party appeals to the reasonableness of honourable members generally. We contend that if the protection of secondary industries is to he continued to the detriment of the more important primary industries, those who hold the belief that the secondary industries are the more important should play their part by supporting those industries by establishing a bonus system to which all the taxpayers of Australia should contribute equally, and arranging that the burden shall not be wholly placed on the shoulders of the primary producers. If the burden were levelled over the whole community in this way, and if the people centralized in factories bore their equal share, there would be some reason in the demand for support for the secondary industries; but although I am told that it is a national obligation to produce wheat, and more wheat, £40 is taken from me when I take delivery of my harvester at the ship's side, which means that I am prevented from putting another 40 acres ing wealth to the amount of about £120. For what? To give Protection to secondary' industries in the centralized portions of the Commonwealth, and for the sake of giving employment to the very people who will vote against the interests of the primary industries. I feel that T might easily become a nuisance to honourable members by speaking at too great a length at the present moment, but, as a new member, I content myself with what I have said, except to say that I do hope that the Government, now that the war is over, and when we should get down to solid business, will give us an opportunity of dealing with the Estimates at an early date. I feel quite satisfied that Ministers will be only too willing to return to parliamentary government by the representatives of the people, and give reasonable and proper Then, the opportunity for the consideration of the annual Estimates of Expenditure. That this is necessary is shown very clearly by the first draft of the report of the Economies Commission, which reveals an astounding state of affairs, for which I do not think we should unduly lash any Government, because I dare say it has been contributed to partly by all past Governments. However, it reveals certain flagrant neglect, unbusiness-like methods, and a waste of public money, and if , when the attention of the House has been drawn to this matter, the Government will not take action to save the taxpayers' money where it may be saved without destroying efficiency, then, of course, further action will be necessary.

The Government are asking for Supplv. and it is said that the grant of Supply is being held up. If Supply is not granted within the next fortnight Ministerialists will no doubt declare that the Opposition have prevented the old-age pensioners from receiving their pensions and have delayed the payment of Public Service salaries. The Government have been asked to supply certain information, and they are justified in choosing their own time to meet thatjrequest. The Country party, when they endeavour to show the Government what they ought to do, meet w i th a rebuff, because the dignity of the Government must be preserved. that the Ministry wish to obtain Supply before the House is afforded an opportunity to consider any of the important ' matters awaiting its attention. . I know nothing about what took place on Saturday, but I am satisfied that the Government do not approve of it , and that they wish this matter to be debated in the it is in the House itself that we can have the fullest discussion, and experience shows that an Opposition is better able I apologize if the to obtain information fro m the Government in the House than in Committee. he did' say that there was The request made by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan)' could well have been met by the Government without, any loss of dignity, but it has been received by Ministers in solemn silence.

When the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), on behalf of an Opposition in this House, demanded of the Government of the day certain information he was met with the threat with which we have been greeted; but it has been used too often to have any effect upon us. The Government could have brought us together a fortnight earlier than they did, had they wished to secure Supply within a certain date. I know, of course, that they have many duties, and that the situation confronting them is beset with difficulties. A man who did not recognise that would be an as, because, as has been said again and again, the most able statesmanship will be necessary to deal with the financial situation during the next few years. I do not believe in the way in which the word "" statesmanship "" is applied in the present day, since it does not mean statesmanship in the interests of the people. In all communities, we seem to have, in some way, separated the people from the State. The man who, either by war or financial strategy, can make his country famous is called a statesman, but, in my It is evident opinion, the true statesman is he who has regard for the position of the people of the State rather than a desire to add to the renown of the State itself.

All thisis with right as the honourable member to fly the flag for political purposes. member deny that the Union Jack is flaunted everywhere for political purposes ? anyhow. honourable member is with have as much reverence for the Union Jack as they have for my boots when they fly it for political purposes. In Victoria there are people who demand that the I r i sh shall carry the Union Jacki n f r o n t of the St. Patrick's Day procession, and who say that it is appropriate to fly it on all occasions. If there is a hospital celebration, the Union Jack must be flown. If there is a demonstration against high prices, What harm can the Union Jack must be flown, although the high prices are due to those who are so keen on the flag. It is just as appropriate to fly the red flag for political purposes. I remember hearing a yarn, I often told the the whole of which I cannot very well tell now, about a picture of George Washington, which was held to be appropriate on all occasions, just as the Union Jack is regarded by some in Australia. The Prime Minister, of course, w ill take no notice of what I say; but I ask honourable members opposite whether they think they are gaining anything-whe ther they think they are adding to their own strength, and to the glory of the E m pire, and at the same time weakening the other side when they stop people, by means of the War Precautions Act, from flying flags in a time of peace? There never was any justification for the use of the Act, and there is absolutely none It is quite as now; but honourable members opposite are quite smug and satisfied, because they have all the liberty they desire. They can fly any flag they like, without being gaoled, but I cannot, and I claim as much liberty in this country as any man.

Do honourable members think that gaoling women for flying the red flag is going to do any good ? If they beating the lice out of the lion's skin was do not think so, I ask them to help us to prod the Government^ and especially the Prime Minister, and induce them to withdraw the prosecutions. liberty whilst we out-hun the Hun. We talk of trying Germans for war crimes, whilst, under tlie War Precautions Act, we have interned men in Australia merely because they were of foreign birth and our Courts have fabricated evidence against them. Men have been persecuted here because they were of foreign birth. I have nothing but contempt and horror for the Germans who perpetrated war crimes. I believe some of the statements on the subject have been exaggerated, but I think the perpetrators of those crimes should be punished. When we talk of punishing other people for war crimes we should be prepared to punish those who committed crimes here during the war. The Prime Minister should be punished. I can refer honourable members to a case that occurred here some time ago. The victim is a Pole by birth, who has been in Australia for 36 years and who was naturalized 24 or 25 years ago. Some peculiar circumstances are connected with his life. He was robbed on one occasion, and he caught the thieves himself. They were tried and were set free under a bond to be of good behaviour for twelve months and on condition that they paid back £10 of the money they had stolen. The State Government of Victoria took the £.1.0 from the thieves, but have refused to pay it to the man who was robbed. His shop was broken into, and he thought he had a right to protect himself. One day a. man leaving his shop left a revolver after -Armenians by the Turks and of the him, and the thieves who robbed him discovered that he had the revolver and gave information to the police. The police found the revolver at his place, and tried him for having it in his possession, and he was fined £20. At the trial a letter which he had written to a nephew, a Pole fighting in Germany, was read and translated in the following way:I am pleased you are helping to give the red trousers a thorough beating, and I hope you are convinced tliat you are knocking the lice out of the lion's skin. This will be a warning to both of them to leave us Germans alone for all time. This man denied that the reference to ever in his letter. He tried, through his legal representatives, to obtain the letter from the Defence Department without We talk about success. I also tried to get the letter, but the Department would not produce it because they knew that a lie had been told, and that the reference to the lice iu the lion's skin does not appear iii the letter. The Government interned that man and detained him for three and a half years, during which his business and personal property were left unprotected because of a lying translation of the letter referred to. Could they do worse in Germany? We cannot get the Defence Department to go into the matter at all. The Victorian Government will not hand this man's money over to'him. They say that if has gone into the Consolidated Revenue and they cannot get it out. His property was stolen while he was in the internment camp, to which he was committed because of a lie. Surely honourable members will admit that this man should be given a copy of his letter to prove that there is nothing in it about lice in the lion's skin. The man would have been a fool to have written anything of the kind. The letter he received from his nephew was censored, and he knew that his letter to his nephew would be censored.' We talk about liberty, but I tell honourable members of this House that we are building up a condition of affairs in Australia which will be tbe cause of more trouble than some of them anticipate. No self-respecting people would ever tolerate a Government that would permit such things to occur as I have referred to. We read with horror of the massacre of treatment by Germans during the war of people who came under their control. In our midst we have thousands of cases of the kind I have mentioned.

If that kind of thing is to continue, the troubles that will arise in Australia will be such as to overwhelm even the present Government, with all their might, and in spite of all the talk of what they intend to do when trouble does arise. They have a majority to-day, and have a right to be where they are, because the people put them there. They talked of liberty during the election campaign. They talked of beating the profiteer, and of what they were going to do for the people of Australia. One thing that they ought to do is to remove the blot upon the name of Australia which has been caused as the result of the gaoling of innocent men. ether side is equally blamable for what has been done if he will not help to secure redress for those who have been unjustly treated. I will be told that it is dramatic to make a statement of the sort, and that no purpose is to be gained by it if I say that, should this kind of thing continue, a condition of affairs will be built up here which will overwhelm the party opposite. They laugh when we say so; but we have evidence from other parts of the world of what can take place under certain circumstances. Honourable members may, if they please, laugh at the power of the workers in the cities. Some fair trouble had to be confronted in Great Britain, they are getting a bit of it now in Erance, and if we can believe half we hear, the condition of affairs is even worse in Japan. No member of this House will contend that the Australian is not as brave as the Frenchman or the Japanese, or that he will not be found equally determined to seek redress when he is wronged. If the War Precautions Act is keot in operation to be used as the Prime Minister used it in the late strike of the engineers, we ought to be told that that is the intention of the Government. Why does not the Prime Minister tell us that he is keeping the Act' in operation for the purpose of using it against the industrialists of Australia when they try to improve their position ? We have been assured that the Anglo-Saxon will not resort to the methods adopted by people of other nationalities, but that remains to be seen. We are supposed to be living here under much better Mr Muthews. conditions than are people elsewhere, but if this kind of thing is to continue, I say that, despite the War Precautions Act, the continuance of which only serves to accentuate the disturbed condition of affairs and to stir up the people, we shall within the next few months have a few more strikes. We in Tasmania have been shut off for nine months out of the twelve. old Conservative crowd over there, and deserve all they get. I have heard that the Tasmanians have brought forth a scheme to enable them in future to avoid fhe disadvantages from which they have suffered as the result of industrial unrest. Every honourable member on the a lot. that the Conservatives of Tasmania have conceived a means by which to avoid that suffering in the future.

When they use their powers under the War' Precautions Act to gaol labour men and women, not one of them is fit to live if they have considered the question at all. It is the duty of the Government to prove themselves British. The war is over; fighting ceased sixteen or seventeen months ago.

The Government who persist in keeping the War Precautions Acti n existence and prosecuting persons under the powers whicli it confers, and the people who supand I have no hesitation, on this motion port them in such a policy, deserve nothing but contempt from liberty-loving people. desire to bring before the House a small matter which concerns not only my own electorate, in which it is a burning quesHouse largely to the support they gave tion, but also the electorates of Darling Downs, Lilley, Wide Bay, and, no doubt, some of the constituencies represented by honourable members on the Opposition side. I refer to the disfranchisement of, and other restrictions placed upon, a great many of those who are known as German settlers, but who, after all, are fellow Australians. Those restrictions are at the present time a serious grievance and a handicap to the people in whose behalf I speak. T have no intention of reviving the old controversy as to whether those restrictions should ever have been imposed at all. AlthoughI was at the war when the restrictions were introduced, I quite realize that the Government were carrying, while the war lasted, the greatest burden ever placed upon the shoulders of any Government in Australia. But, thank God, the war is over; we have achieved a victorious peace, and, I think, it is fair to ask the Government-and in this appeal I hope other honourable members who are interested will join-that those restrictions should now be withdrawn. I hold no brief for disloyalty. A man who would do a disloyal act, who could be a traitor in either deed or thought to his fellow countrymen when they are at war with another great power, deserves no sympathy, but merits the severest penalty -that could be inflicted upon him. But honourable members will agree that many of the German settlers were placed in a cruel and most unhappy position. They were induced by the Government to come to Australia; they were welcomed as settlers, and a great portion of the coastal the fund's of the National party camearea in my own State and in other portions in Australia owes its present prosperi ty to the efforts of those people. A motion for the granting of Supply seems to me a particularly opportune moment for bringing forward this question, beoause the persons on whom these restrictions are imposed invariably say to me, "" We are not considered worthy to have a vote, but we are not exempted from any taxation."" That is the way in which the Government policy appeals to them, for the granting of Supply, in asking the Government to> reconsider tlie whole question and repeal the restrictions as quickly as possible. I cannot imagine any bigger I proof of the loyalty of the people whose cause I am pleading than the fact that I , a returned soldier, owe my seat in this me at the polling booth. That after the word "" That"" the following words be inserted:-""the Government be censured for (a) their failure to deal with profiteering: (6) their injudicious expenditure; (c), tlieir control of shipping, and of wheat, wool, metals, and otlier products."" I make no apology for moving this amendment. I believe the Government are deserving of censure, particularly in regard to the matters specified, but also in regard to many others. I know that some honourable members on the Government side say that there is no profiteering in Australia. Some people are never tired of assuring us that there is no profiteering in the community. If they cannot feel the results .of this evil in their own homes, they must be very fortunate in dividuals indeed. We have only to read the newspapers to learn the enormous profits which are being made by many sections of the community. Yet the Government have so f a r failed to l if t even a finger to deal w i th this question. When returning thanks to my constituents for having again elected me to this House, I said that I regarded the return to power of the Nationalist Government as a great victory for the profiteer. In this connection what did the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson), who attended practically every Caucus meeting of the National party during the last session of this Parliament, say? He had no doubt about the organization of the profiteers, and he had no doubt as to' where from . From the Age newspaper of 20th November last, I extract the following in regard to his candidature:The National Federation was referred to by the candidate ns an "" organization of vested city interests drawing a colossal fighting fund from the manufacturers and Flinders-lane, and,, perhaps, from other sources such a6 was indi-",51,Mcwilliams Then I Do Not Have Put Up Hundreds Of Miles Of Tele

These profiteers could lie shot with a short-range gun from an upstairs room in Parliament House looking east, but that they were not likely to shoot the goose that laid such golden eggs.

In the Melbourne Argus of 9th February last I find the following The report of the Committee appointed under the Profiteering Act to inquire into wool-spihncrs' profits has been issued by the Board of Trade. It shows that enormous profits have been made by spinners. In the highest instances, the excess percentage over the profits officially allowed, works out at 3,900 per cent., and in no case is the excess of profit over that allowed by the War Office schedule of fair prices less than 250 per cent. The Committee says that at least half of the forty types of yarn investigated showed a profit of not less than 25d. a pound. The excess percentage accruing to the spinners on some grades of yarn ranged from 2,500 per cent, down to S33 per cent. The spinners objected to the figures on which tliese calculations were based on the ground that they were misleading, and supplied their own figures, which showed profits ranging from 2,400 to 250 per cent. That cable was printed under the following headlines: I did not test it in all '-'Enormous profits made by spinners-"" "" Thousands per cent."" Talk about taking a chance in Tattersall's sweep. It is nothing like this. powers of the Commonwealth Government over those people ? the matter of how the Commonwealth Government have failed to suppress the profiteer in Australia. An extract from the Melbourne Herald readsThousands per Gent. Alleged. (Published in The Times.) London, 16th January. Extraordinary disclosures regarding profits on wool startled a meeting of the Central Profiteering Committee. Mr Mackinder, a Yorkshire warehouseman, reporting on tbe results of the official subcommittee's investigation as to the costs of six standard counts of yarn, said that the profits now made ranged from 400 per cent, to 3,000 per cont. beyond the War Office's former allowance. The spinners' own figures were quoted in every instance. The Government itself was still making colossal profits. The spinners themselves admit that they are making 2,400 per cent, upon these yarns. Honourable members who have any knowledge of the trade know that there are a number of articles that we are bound to import, because we do not make any cotton piece-goods in Australia. Buti n some cases the prices of these goods have advanced from 2j?d. per yard to more than 2s. per yard. Why? Because a Combine has got hold of the mills in Lancashire, and its agents are offering the shareholders in the mills five or six times the cost of their shares. A mill which was built within half-a-mile of where I worked on the borders of Cheshire, and which was equipped for £80,000 before the war, was purchased by the Combine last year for £500,000. Let any honourable member who is interested in this matter go down to Flinders-lane and make inquiries of the people who are using these goods. He will find. that cotton material which cost 4^d. per yard",52,Mcwilliams Then I Do Not Have Put Up Hundreds Of Miles Of Tele

The other day in England the firm of J . and P. Coats declared that its immense profits had been made, not in Great Britain, bub abroad. Australia, where women are now forced to pay 8d., 10d., and as much as Is. a reel for cotton thread that used to cost 2d. or 2-^d. a reel before the war, has contributed its share. the firm of J. and P. Coats? for its thread, ought we to remain supine ? The Government should see that our people are not robbed, either by a combination of importers or by a local combination. We ought not to sit idle when these things are taking place. It was stated this afternoon that an enormous amount is now being paid for harvesters. So far as I know, there is nothing to prevent any one from manufacturing harvesters in this country, and if the manufacturers have come together to put up rices, they are only doing what others ave done, and nothing is said by honourable members opposite against such action. But let the workers endeavour to raise their wages, and improve their industrial conditions, and there is immediately an outcry from honourable members opposite, and those whom they represent. The working man is denounced if he tries at to better himself. Knibbs proves beyond doubt that the cost of living has increased How can the at a greater rate than the wages in anytrade or calling in Australia. Some of the coal owners have increased their profits by over 100 per cent., but I do not No doubt the know of any calling in which wages have been increased by 100 per cent. We learned by cable towards the end of last These people who are year that the firm of J . and P. Coats had made a profit of £3,899,000-that is. practically, £4,000,000-a n increase of'50 per cent, over its profit for the pre-war year 1913-14, which was £2,600,000. There are only two ways in which a manufacturing firm can make big profits-by taking them out of its work people, or by raising prices to the consumers of the article which it manufactures. I know enough of the cotton weavers and spinners of Lancashire to be certain that they will not allow undue profits to be made out of them. We have been told by a member of the Country party that the Government has no right to touch the Tariff, and to These men could be start new industries in our midst; that we must leave ourselves at the mercy of the manufacturing sharks on the other side of the world. Many of these manufacturers would sweat the last drop of blood out of their'employees. I know that less than twenty years ago children under thirteen years of age were at work in Lancashire, going to the mills at 6 o'clock in the morning, and working every morning for one week while attending school in the afternoons, and in the next week attending school in the morning and working in the afternoon.

214,Mr Tudor,"I have said it before. IHolman Government shows that in the coal industry a profit of over 150 per cenb. per annum has been made. Let me read a newspaper comment on the report of the CommissionLet it be said, in passing, that the report proves right up to the hilt everything that has been penned in these columns from time to time regarding profiteering in tlie coal industry. Listen to this, during the war no less than twenty-eight coal companies in New South Wales showed profits of over 10 per cent, on the capital employed in production, seventeen made over 20 per cent., and nine each over 30 per cont. Three of them made profits of over 60 per cent., while one colliery was allowed to make a profit, in 1018, of no less than 1544 per cont. Capital District. in prosold. duction.

The policy evidently is to take it out of the poorest people who cannot afford to buy more than 1 cwt. While the war was on, I gave an account of the Wallaroo and Moonta Copper Mining Company, in the district of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster). In the three years, 1915, 1916, and 1917, the company made, adding the money that had gone to reserves, a profit of 186 per cent. Mr RrcHAHD FOSTER -That is a company which gives its employees a percentage increase according to the rise in copper. It is the best company in that respect in Australia. bigger percentage itself. I am not finding fault with the company for the way it treats its employees. I have always said that I would never defend a close organization, consisting of 100 per cent, of both employers and employees, if they combined together to put up the price of an article to the public. All I said was that the Wallaroo and Moonta Company made the profits I mentioned', as I proved in the House. they never made a penny profit. man who was selling everything cheaper than cost. He was asked how he could do it , and he said he made a b it of profit on the paper and the string. It is strange that so few of these people apply for old-age pensions. It is only in the poorer districts that the people are forced to do so. that these people combined to put up the price of copper? cause I know that the price of copper is regulated by the price in the world's market, and not by any particular mine. Honourable members are anxious to know what the Government can do to deal with these enormous profits, and what can be done with the people who are abroad. The following is a case that occurred in Sydney while the election was on;In the Central Summons Court to-day, Mr answer to his question which appeared Thomas Alfred Field was proceeded against by the Federal Income Tax Department on a charge that he had understated his income in a return submitted for the twelve months ending 30th June, 1917. Mr Lambert, KC., who appeared for the Federal authorities, alleged that Field had returned his income as £45,000for the year, but in a later return had admitted that he should have shown £03,000. Investigation, however, showed that his income for tliat year was really £71,000. That is only a matter of £1,400 per week, which is the decent minimum wage that Mr Field was making, and the Government do not l if t a little finger .to stop h i m from making those enormous profits. The Income Tax Department certainly tackled h i m for making a wrong return, but the Government take no action so far as profiteering is concerned. We all know what happened when the Government decided to deal with the price of meat. A deputation was arranged for in Melbourne, and these. "" poor "" people chartered seven special trains. It is only the really'poor people who can. get a special train. They were allowed to have their deputation in the Queen's H a l l , and I am informed by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) that, when my name was mentioned they did me the honour to hoot it . That is one of the finest testimonials I have ever received of f a i r treatment to the public. Those hoots came from the people who hung up the consumers' meat, and deliberately had stock trains and auction sales cancelled, so that no meat would be delivered to the Melbourne market. This Mr T.

237,Mr Tudor,"J . can quite appreciateThe Government requested the InterState Commission to inquire how much bhe increased cost of living had been brought about by Trusts, Combines, and the like. For particulars of the inquiry I refer honourable members to the report dealing with bread. Why did not the Government take action upon the report of the Inter-State Commission? professed to do so. They were furnished with a report, also, in respect of^meat: but before that document saw the light of day in the House, it was referred back to the Commissioners. Legal proceedings arose in Sydney, and as formidable a Bar was present in Court to represent the owners and producers and the meat companies of New South Wales as has everappeared in any case in Australia. Practically every King's Counsel in the State was engaged. at any rate, that-their side would be. heard. sumers. sion brought in a report concerning what should be done with regard to meat, but the Government did not act upon it ; they had ample power to do so, too. Then, recently, a report was presented upon the matter of house rentals. Honourable members must know that rents have been increasing practically everywhere. I have in mind certain habitations in my own electorate, which, by the way, has received a little publicity in the matter of housing accommodation during th«: past few months. There is a thoroughfare in my district known as Tennysonstreet. That is the name given to it by the municipal council, in honour of the celebrated poet. r ple who reside in the neighbourhood another There is a width of 10 feet from the extreme edge of the f r o n t verandahs of the houses in "" Pickle Alley"" across to the wall of the pickle factory opposite. The children ofTennyson-street have no other place but that alley in which to play. From the extreme edge of the back verandahs to the rear of the properties there is a depth of only 45 feet. The six houses have a total frontage of 115 feet, and honourable members can imagine the congestion that exists when they realize that they occupy a space not much larger than this chamber. Rents are increasing in Richmond as well as. everywhere else, and, although the Government have had the opportunity of dealing with this question, they have failed to do so. The honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Lamond) said a little -while ago that I was dealing with overseas questions, and he wished me to refer to instances in Australia. I have referred to the coal produced in the honorThey able member's electorate, and now call his attention to the rents cases. In the report of the Inter-State Commission, reference is made to the tweed manufacturers, and the fact that they had made enormous profits-u p to 40 per cent, in one year. Notwithstanding this, no action has been taken. The Inter-State Commission reported that this occurred at a time when the output was sold to the Government for Defence purposes. Those parties made sure, I have said before that the best way to stop profiteering is to fix a maximum No one appeared for the conprofit-le t the Government fix a maxiEven after that the Commismum income for the manufacturer, and commandeer all above the maximum so fixed. member mean a maximum profit or a maximum percentage of the profits on the capital invested ? should be fixed by the Government;.

241,Mr Tudor,"Yes; the Commissionto the conditions prevailing throughout the Commonwealth, by the time their labours are completed, it will be necessary to commence again. If it takes the Commission three or four months to complete its inquiries in Melbourne, a similar period in Sydney, and six weeks in Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth, honourable members can easily realize that its recommendations will be of little value at the end of that period. It would also be necessary for the Commission to visit Tasmania, because, if due attention is not given to that State, the threat of the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Atkinson) that the people of that State will take a referendum on the question of withdrawing from the Federation may materialize. ter's statement at Bendigo early in November will prove correct. that the referenda would be carried. for Illawarra ( Mr Lamond) seems somewhat perturbed concerning the referenda, and I repeat what I said on the floor of the House on a previous occasion that had the Government been sincere in their endeavour to deal with this matter, we would have supported them. Honourable members know my attitude on this question. If the Basic Wage Commission takes as long in other States as it is taking here, its recommendations will be of little value. long?

I made that statement at a public meeting, and one lady was very annoyed. Perhaps she would suggest placing a weight on the head of children to prevent .them growing, and thus enable them to wear their clothes for a period of years. A good deal was said during the recent election campaign concerning the alleged increase in the cost of living in Queensland under the Premiership of my friend, the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryau). I have before me Knibbs' figures to September, 1919, which are contained in the Bulletin distributed two or three months ago. In connection with the Brisbane figures, he said that in the third quarter of 1914, when war broke out, it would take £ 1 Os. Id. to purchase what the sovereign would purchase previously, but that at the end of 1915 it would take I hope the Prime Minis25s. Id. to do so. It must be borne in mind that the Labour Government did not assume office in Queensland until the middle of 1915, and so it cannot be blamed for what happened during the Denham regime. It will be admitted that it takes any Government a few months to get to work. At the end of 1915 the equivalent to the purchasing power of the sovereign was 25s. Id., but at the end of 1916 it had decreased to 22s. lOd. That is the only State in the Commonwealth where there was an appreciable drop in the purchasing power of the sovereign. mean. Id. at the end of 1915 to 22s. lOd. at the end of 1916. At the end of 1916, or early in 1917, the Federal Government took over the whole work of price-fixing, and the State Governments were told to ""keep off the grass."" If any increaseoccurred in Queensland the fault is not with the Labour Government, but with the National Government of Australia. One of the conditions of the coalition between the Liberals and the National Labour party was that price-fixing should be abolished, and in February, 1917, the Price Fixing Commissioners in each State received notice to wind up their offices. That occurred before the Ready incident, but when Senator Keating and Senator My Bakhap refused to vote for a continuation of the life of the then Parliament that order was withdrawn, and Federal price-fixing, although it has been abolished in the case of most commodities, still remains operative.

Such conditions are absolutely scandalous, and I am not surprised at the industrial unrest that prevails amongst some of the sections of the community. Indeed, I am surprised that there is not more of it . Yet honourable members smile smugly and laugh at these conditions. The Prime Minister knows that when he and I were piloting the Navigation Bill through the House we had determined upon a certain course of action so far as the life-saving provisions were concerned had there been any objection on the part of the other side. The housing conditions on some of these ships are not a credit to the companies that own the vessels, nor to any Government that' allows ithem to continue. Although the Government have suspended the operation of the Navigation. Act. I urge them to seriously consider the position. In some parts of Australia there are ports concerning which some exemption might be made, and I think there is provision in one of the earlier sections of firms, their business being tp prepare in the Navigation Act for this to be done. For instance, some ports on the north-west coast of ""Western Australia are not usually visited by Australian vessels, and so if a boat coming down from Singapore calls there, it might reasonably expect some exemption from the provisions of the Navigation Act. I am not in favour of cutting off any port in Australia from communication with the rest of the Commonwealth, but I say that better accommodation and better conditions must be insured to the men engaged in our coastal service. ""WhatI have said is absolutely true. I coiild make stronger statements if I wished, but I have no desire to do so. The conditions are not better than I have described. In some respects they are much worse, so if the Government are anxious to insure industrial peace they should take action. the north-west ports of Western Australia? If not, how would you put shipping in place of the vessels that call there able member for Gippsland ( Mr Wise), . now? in regard to ports not visited by Australian vessels, there might be some exemption. While debating the general question this afternoon, some statements were made by certain honourable members with reference to uniform taxation schedules, and when the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr James Page) was speaking, I interjected that the Treasurer ( Mr Watt) had declared that if a uniform schedule were adopted, there would be a Saving of £3,000,000 in the preparation of returns. The Minister has informed me I was not correct; so evidently I misunderstood him, but I do know that some people pay more for the preparation of their returns than they pay in taxation. tion has arisen in this State. I understand that Mr Eastwood, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation for Victoria, has retired from the Service, and intends to set up in business as a taxation expert.

The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) received to-day an answer to a question put by him which shows that there has been injudicious exof him. penditure in connection with Dr. Gilruth, who, until recently, was Administrator of the Northern Territory. that expenditure was provided for by the Government to which the honourable member belonged. when Dr. Gilruth, in one year, was allowed to remain in Melbourne for 207 days. Gilruth was appointed Administrator? years ago by a Government of which the present Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) and I were members. We used to work together in those days; that was before the right honourable gentleman had fallen from grace. I recognise that it is quite possible for any man to make a mistake. We can all be wise after the event, and I certainly thought that in selecting Dr. Gilruth for the position of Administrator the Government of the day had made a wise choice. is the personification of wisdom. ruth's six months' furlough in England of the Government, and the allowance of £2 2s. per day made to him while on sick-leave furlough also represents injudicious expenditure.

Having regard to the steady rise in the cost of paper, that publication, no doubt, costs even more to-day. Such expenditure is undoubtedly in judicious. I do not intend to deal with the shipbuilding contracts. The contract entered into with the Patterson McDonald Shipbuilding Company, of Seattle, for the construction of certain cargo-carrying ships, at a cost of 5,000,000 dollars, was subsequently increased to 8,000,000 dollars. for the cancellation of the contract £365,000, according to the report of the Auditor-General. I know that sometimes it is better to "" cut vour losses""; but, in monwealth a Board of Management recently my opinion, the building of those ships was a mistake from start to finish. They were not built with seasoned timber, and ib cost more to repair some of them than it did to construct them; in short, as the Auditor-General shows, it was a bungle and a blunder from beginning to end. There are other subjects with which, no doubt, other honourable members will deal, such as the sale of wool and the handing over to the British Government of half the profits from the sale of wheat; and if ever there were transactions into which there should be not only a State, but a Commonwealth, inquiry, they are these. I have never been greatly in favour of Commissions of inquiry, and I do not know that I ever voted for the appointment of one; but, certainly, there are some matters into which inquiry should"" be made. The wheat sale is one of them, the purchase of the Shaw Wireless Installation is another, and the mysterious resignation of ex-Senator Beady is a third .

Honourable members in the Government corner, the so-called "" Country party ""-the party christened itself with this fascinating name.

278,Mr Parker Moloney,"Becaus ethe Government. For the six months ending 31st December, 1919, there was an increase in the expenditure of £3,676,000, and a deficit on the transactions for the six months of £345,372. In the last six months they have gone to the bad by over £360,000, and to that extent they have been living beyond their income. There is not a private business in the country the managers of which would think of carrying on in the same way. I have just said that the promise made by the Prime Ministeri n regard Board of Management for the public Departments has been absolutely ignored, and I suppose it is going to meet the fate of all the other promises of the Prime Minister. He promised to "" shoot the profiteers,"" and said that if the referendum proposals were not carried he would not continue to lead the Government; yet he continues to lead. I do not propose to dwell on these matters, because I know something of the Prime Minister, and do not expect h i m to live up to these promises any more than he has lived up to any he has ever made. When the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan), the late Premier of Queensland, was speaking to-day with regard to profiteering, the statement was made in this House, which was often uttered during the recent election campaign, that he should not speak about profiteering orthe high cost of living, because in* the State of Queensland the cost of living was higher than in any other Statei n the Commonwealth. That might have been all right as electioneering tactics. What was said was that the honourable five, or six children upon a wage which, member had equal powers to stop proin view of the intense cost of living in fiteering. also said that the cost of living was higher in Queensland that in any other they are only existing. State of the Commonwealth. literature circulated by the party opposite scarcely be said that they are living.

A reference has been made to the matter already by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), but I have here a concrete and definite statement which appeared in the daily newspapers of 27th November last, just a few weeks before the election. I presume that honourable members opposite had this in their possession, or knew of it , while still repeating the misstatement to which I have re-, f erred. The newspaper statement is plainly that according to the latest comto the appointment of a pilation of finance statistics, Mr Knibbs, the Commonwealth Statistician, shows what it now costs in the various States to purchase what the sovereign purchased before the war. And it shows very clearly that the purchasing power of the sovereign was greater in Brisbane than in any of the other capital cities of the Commonwealth. That is not my statement, or a statement loosely made by the members of the party on this side, but by the Commonwealth Statistician. Having been made by him, it should have been accepted by those who continued to repeat the misstatement that the cost of living was higher in Queensland than in any of the other States of the Commonwealth . I leave this matter of profiteering, because if one is to touch it at all there is so much to be said about it that one does not know where to begin and where to end. I have only to add that I do not know for the life of me how many of the families in this country are living to-da.y. It is a puzzle to me to understand how the heads of households in this country, with wages of £ 4 or £ 3 a week, or less, Australia to-day, can only be regarded as a miserable pittance. be given of what is taking place to-day And it was a gross misin this country than the simple example I used at the last election, and which I They get the material direct",64,Profits On Wool Startling Disclosures

If any man in this country wishes to purchase a similar suit made of the same material, it w ill cost him £ 1 0 10s. or £ 1 1 l is . The difference in these prices represents the toll which has to be paid to-day to those who belong to the class that toils not, neither does it spin, but lives on the toil and industry of others. cost of these suits to the Victorian railway employees is accounted for by the fact that the material does not go through the hands of middlemen before it passes to the railway servants. I do not wish to enlarge upon that, but I regard it as one of the simplest examples that can be given to show to what extent the people of this country are being fleeced by those who stand in between the producers and the consumers in Australia. I listened with considerable interest this afternoon to the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) when he was speaking about the influx of the people from the country to the cities of Australia. We are all aware of that. In Victoria, practically half the population of the State reside in the city of Melbourne. Wales, practically half the population reside in the city of Sydney. knows that the reason is that men are discouraged from remaining on the lands of the country, and others are discouraged from going out of the cities to take up the work of primary production. sume that the honourable member for Swan is as well aware as I , or any other member of the House, of the causes of the condition of affairs of which he complains. During the last four years there has been a greater influx of people from the country into the cities than at any time hitherto within my recollection. The Government who have occupied the Treasury bench during the past four years are more responsible for that state of affairs than anything else I know of. From figures that I have, I find that during the past three years the area under wheat in Australia has declined by something like 4,750,000 acres. lieve that the real reason for that has [ 7 ] -2 been the dissatisfaction that has existed among the wheat-growers of the country in regard to the manner in which wheat has been sold, and the incomplete and bad arrangements that have been made by the Government. drought, of course, to a certain extent. only been during the past two years that the drought has had: any really great The lower effect in reducing the area under cultivation for wheat. There are a number of people, and perhaps some honourable members also, who do not seem to realize that we have a drought in Australia today. I have only to say that I believe that the drought which now exists is one of the worse this country has ever experienced, but it only intensifies the dissatisfaction created by the incomplete and injudicious arrangements for the marketing of our primary produce overseas. Knowing the hardships suffered by the primary producers, I feel so strongly on the subject that, had not this motion of censure been moved, I should have moved the adjournment of the Housei n order to draw attention to this matter, and with a view to having some inquiry instituted into the oversea marketing of In New South our primary products. Everybody who takes an interest in this matter knows Every one that the wheat growers of Australia have not received half the price paid to the farmers of Canada and Argentine. The glib excuse offered by the Prime Minister and his supporters is that the difference I asin prices is accounted for by the difference in the freight charge on wheat from Australia, and that sent from North and South America. I w ill not accept that statement, and I shall not rest u n t i l I have found out what han been the real cause of the disparity Ui prices. One could not have a more emphatic answer to that statement than tilt statement of the Prime Ministeri n my electorate, during the recent campaign, that the freights from Australia were the same as those from the Argentine. As far back as March, 1917, he stated that the freights from Australia were about the same as those arranged from Argentine to Europe on behalf of the farmers.

303,Mr Ryan,"They adopt the policy of the worse it is for those in Australia, who are waiting to share half the profits in the re-sale of the wool. We know that our clips have not been disposed of to the best advantage. things said by Sir Arthu r GoldfinchHis Department was striving to increase tlie quantity offered at tlie auctions, and thereby, probably within two or three months, reduce the values by 10 to 20 per cent. I could nob ask for more complete proof that there has been a systematic forcing down of prices iu connection with Australian wool sold overseas. Isi t any wonder, then, that members wish to find out in what manner the sales in Great Britain have been conducted ? opinion, a bad bargain was made by the Government. I do not think that any one outside the Ministry knows the cir-> cumstances under which it was agreed to give the Imperial Government one-half of the profits which might be made by the re-sale of our wool. I do not know who instigated that arrangement, and if a binding contract has not been entered into, I am ready to make one to put an end to it . If we remove the present Ministry, who are largely responsible for what has been done, we shall have an opportunity of probing these matters to the bottom. Members of the so-called Country party committed themselves in their busting speeches to an attempt to find out about these things, and the amendment provides them with an opportunity to do so, and to prove whether they are, or are not, merely a wing of the Nationalist party. If I were to speak about all the misdeeds of. this Government, and to show how these have reacted on the primary producers of the country, there would be no end to my speech. What greater charge could be brought against a Ministry than that to which they laid themselves open during the last Parliament by re-selling at the end of the harvest some 40,000 bales of cornsacks, which they had purchased in India, ostensibly for the benefit of the primary producers? sell these cornsacks to bhe primary producers at 9s. 6d. per dozen, but, instead of doing so, they sold them to private speculators. to the co-operative companies. that that statement has been made. have bought them just as well as any one else. have This is one of the the cash. not expected to give away the sacks. sold on bills. middlemen. The statements made by honourable members on the hustings will not do here. I know it has been said that the primary producers had an opportunity to purI n my chase these bags through their co-operative agencies; but when these agencies said that they could get accommodation from the banks, they were told that they must do so within three days. The Government were assured, on behalf of the primary producers, that the money required to pay for these sacks would be forthcoming, but only .three days were allowed by the Government for the finding of the necessary accommodation, and therefore the farmers were prevented from getting the sacks. The Government turned to their real friends, to those to whom they looked for support, and from whom, no doubt, they got it at the elections; those who contributed largely to their election expenses. The cornsacks were handed over to the middlemen at the cost price of 9s. 6d. a dozen, and, subsequently, farmers in my electorate had to pay 16s. 6d. a dozen for them, the sum of £300,000 odd thus being pocketed by men who live by farming tlie farmers, and prosper by the toil and industry of those on the land. A t the present time this country is suffering from one of the worse droughts that it has ever experienced, a drought that is probably unprecedented. Many men who have lived on the land for years are being forced off it , and it They promised to would be a godsend to them if the contract handing over half the profits on the sales of wool to the Imperial Government could be altered. I believe that, if proper representations were made to the I m perial Government, and stress laid on the fact that these people are to-day suffering hardships which are unprecedented in I know this country, the Imperial Government would do the f a i r thing.

311,Mr Parker Moloney,"Yes.know, the contract is not a written one, and even the cable messages have not been ratified. I will make one in this House to find out who were responsible for it, and,' if possible, to have it cancelled. That matter, and .the arrangements in regard to the sales of wheat overseas, are enough in themselves to condemn this Government for the bad deals they have made on behalf of the primary producers. So far as I am concerned, I want nothing more to commend the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. The cotton-growers of Egypt received every penny for the sales of their cotton overseas in Great Britain. They were not asked to give up half of the profits to the Imperial Government, nor' did that Government ask it in the case of the primary producers of India. ""Why is it that Australia, the one country in which the primary producers aTe suffering to an unprecedented degree, has been picked out, and the producers asked to hand over half of the profits on the overseas sales of their products? I protest against it on behalf of the people who are to some extent responsible for sending me here. I will go to any length to help any party in this House to make the Government give the necessary information to the House and the country. Failing that, I will assist any other party to remove the Government from office, so that we may be able to probe these matters right to the bottom. adjourned.
