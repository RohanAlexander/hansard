The expense of making good the depreciation occasioned by the wear and tear of the coin so issued will be borne by the Commonwealth. 3 and 4. The Commonwealth is to bear the expense of replacing all worn gold coins of future issues by Australian mints. possible to differentiate between the Australian coins which are, and those which are not, used in Australia, as they travel all round the world.

It is quite true that there have been keen differences of opinion upon some very important provisions of this measure, but when we consider the novel and difficult problems with which it deals, I do not think, the fact that there have been such difficulties can excite surprise. I believe that these difficulties of opinion have been honestly fought out on -the part of aovery large number of honourable members of this Chamber. I do not think a better proof of that fact can be found than is afforded by the circumstance that the members of the Senate-mos t of them highly competent to judge of the merits of a measure of this character, both from practical spite of the number of large questions of great novelty and difficulty which are involved in legislation of this nature, have found owing to the thorough vision of the Bill by the Houseit necessary to make only four amendments in the whole measure.

ThisB ill , so far from aiming at a sort of benevolent despotism, which would enable every man working for another, or every employer having an individual in his service, to bring his individual grievance before the Court, has a totally different object. No person is attempting to create what I should call a domestic jurisdiction of that kind. No Court on earth, could grapple with the inI do dividual disputes of persons throughout the whole range of industrial employment. I refer to the fourth The main object, and the main effort, of this new departure, as I understand it -and even in.this aspect I have looked upon the proposal as one involving many difficulties-is to deal with organized bodies, both of employers and workers, and especially with bodies relating to industries where the conditions are uniform, or approach uniformity -We can neve; forI f the honourable member get that we are dealing with the industrial life and effort of a comparatively small number of human beings, scattered over a continent embracing an area of 3,000,000 square miles. Any attempt to follow individual difficulties in industries round the whole continent would commend itself only to some person not quite in possession of his faculties. From the very first mention of a Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Act, I think that every one, both in the Conventions and out of them, has kept steadily in mind the view that it would apply to large bodies, the conditions of whose employment are practically the same throughout the States-that it would apply to such disputes as those affecting perThe Government do not propose sons engaged' in maritime pursuits, shearers Coming to the ways. relate to disputes affecting railway employees.

But the view which the Government take with reference to the inclusion of persons working in agricultural industries is to be expressed under one or two very simple heads. In the first place, we consider-and in so considering we rememI t has to deal with orber the vast variety of conditions which prevail owing to climate, owing to seasons, owing to the varying capacities of the soil -the infinite variety of conditions affecting labour and employment, and remuneration, which are presented by an attempt to bring persons engaged in the rural industries of Australia under the scope of a measure of this kind.",17,Order Of Business Commission

The term "" industrial organizations "" shows that. may be included as associations. have to take up time by admitting that they are human beings; but I wish to point out that the Arbitration Court, in our opinion, will have a sufficiently, formidable task, even to deal with these highly-organized industries, whose conditions of employment are practically the same all over the Commonwealth, without entering upon an attempt to deal with difficulties of the character to which I have referred. That is one observation which I have to make. The second observation which I have to make is this: There have been Arbitration Acts in force, as we know, in various parts of Australia-in New South Wales, not so long in Western Australia, but for a good many years, and in New Zealand. tern Australia. Western Australian Act was more recent. ThenI understand that the Western Australian Act has been in existence even longer than the New South Wales Act? that Compulsory Arbitration Acts have been Western Australia, and New South Wales far as I know, there is not a single union in existence in connection with these rural industries throughout the length and breadth of Australia. I believe that is an accurate statement. No union of any kind has been organized in New Zealand which embraces persons who come under the definition of persons employed in agricultural, viticultural, horticultural, or dairying pursuits. the States Acts. which even lawyers may differ. opinion about it . getting that lawyers can differ about anythingthat, so far as the structure of the New Zealand Act is concerned-the Western Australian Act is not quite so clear either one way or the other tion I take up. under the New South Wales Act. quite right; though domestic servants are expressly excluded. That strengthens the I hope that I shall not remark I wish to make. We will take it as indisputable that there is nothing fo prevent persons engaged in the agricultural and the other industries mentioned from forming unions in New Zealand, New South Wales, and Western Australia, and getting the benefit of the compulsory arbitration law. Now, I say that the fact that, having the opportunity to avail themselves of such laws, the agricultural workers of New Zealand and New South Wales and Western Australia have never made the slightest effort to form a union for the purpose of getting fhe advantages of such legislation, is surely one of the strongest proofs that we need not be so desperately anxious about them with reference to a measure of Federal concern. excluded. friends opposite will recollect that I am aware that, in what I am saying, they are entirely opposed to me, and they need not give any evidence of that fact by way of interruption. I know it , and admit it . I only point to the notorious fact that, in spite of the zeal the creditable zeal in force in New Zealand, which has been shown in the organization of trade unionism throughfor some . years past. So out Australia, by forming as many trade unions as possible, the agricultural workers have not been organized. So far as I am concerned I have never made a secret of the fact that I am a thorough believer in that form of organization. I believe that, in times long gone by, the advantages of combined action were altogether in favour of different classes and different interests, and the position of the workers in past ages was very much owing to the absence of this development of trade unionism which exists to-day. able gentleman wants to cripple it. presently, and in doing that the honourable",18,Order Of Business Commission

First of all, there has not been an attempt to form a trade union; and, secondly, that is an acknowledgment of the impossibility of applying conditions of the sort contemplated, after investigation by this kind of j judicial authority, to the varieties of circumstance and want of uniformity which exist in connection with the agricultural industries.

The next matter to which I proposed to refer was with reference to the inclusion of domestic servants.

But we are not dealing here with conflagrations, lighted by incendiary means, but with honest disputes between people who have honest grievances. are not dealing with persons who have a mere desire to extend the area of industrial misunderstanding. In the first place, I say that we cannot accept the inclusion of domestic servants for the reasons which I gave in dealing with the inclusion of those engaged in rural industries, anrs I think that the argument is even stronger, if that were necessary, against the inclusion of domestic servants. In connection with the history of this particular measure, it must not be forgotten that there was an express -provision in this Bill when it was introduced by the Barton Government, excepting domestic servants from its operation. that, but when the Watson Government Came into power and took up the Bill, the)' gave notice of a number of amendments they intended to move upon it, and if I am correctly informed, in the schedule of amendments submitted by that Administration, there was no proposal to retheir inclusion. move the exclusion of domestic servants.

But, as a matter of fact, the Watson Government did not propose to do this, while the honourable member for Kennedy did propose it, I do not deny and then, no doubt, the Watson Government very heartily supported it . That involved a change of their policy on this particular matter.

I think I can dispose of that position without any difficulty. honourable gentleman if he could not do so! grounds of reason, which will recommend themselves even to the intelligence of my worthy friend who interjects. that he has the numbers. I am correct in saying that, in respect of those three differences between the Senate and this House, the majority of the members of the Senate, and of honourable members sitting opposite, are one party, sailing in the same boat. That is a fact which has to be remembered. affinities. the attraction' of the law of gravitation applying to bodies in near juxtaposition. man said the same when the Tariff was before Parliament. I am. the body of opinion expressed in those three proposed amendments represents the battleground of honourable members opposite-n o more and no less. The Labour Party, as we all know, is in strong evidence in both Houses. But it is the same party-it is the same body, and the same struggle; and when honourable members wish to make out that, instead of the old battle coming on again in the same quarter, it is some impartial and august distant tribunal which is appealing for the revision of our views, I say, with every respect to honourable members in another place, that the fight which If the honourable member was fought out on this floor is the same fight repeated in the Senate by the three It amendments. entirely different. Sir WILLIAM LYNE 1 think the right honourable gentleman's remark applies more particularly to one amendment. member for.Hume is perfectly right when he suggests that my remark applies more particularly to the preference amendment. As to that amendment, and also with regard to the inclusion of States' public servants, it must be recollected that honourable members who sit on this side have, many of them, made most serious concessions in I hope I shall do so upon order that this Bill may be brought into operation. It .is an unusual fact, but it is a fact that one Prime Minister, who was in charge of the measure, felt it his duty to do the incredible thing, namely, to resign his distinguished position; and that gentleI n the first place, I think man, and others on this side who also held similarly strong opinions against the inclusion of State public servants, are now allowing the Bill to go through, so far as they are concerned, with this provision to which they have such serious objection. I do not think that that concession is to be underrated. If those mischievous tactics, to which honourable members refer, of men voting against their principles in order to achieve a certain object, were put in vogue, it would be only necessary for one or two of those who have strong opinions against the inclusion of States public servants, to do a pretty good stroke of business in the way of wrecking the B ill by changing their vote.

It is difficult for my friends of the Opposition to realize that other human beings are as capable as themselves of taking disinterested views of public matters.

But I do not object to the restlessness of my friends opposite, because it is a sign that things are going well; it is one of those familiar signs which I am. well able to appreciate. I believe honourable members opposite would be much more disappointed if I were to accept the three amendments. opposite would be infinitely more disappointed if the Government were to accept these amendments. make any fair and reasonable concession, I take up the position that .the three matters appealed to the people, and appeal to Pardealt with in these amendments are of too great importance for the Government to surrender upon. That is the view which the Governnient take; and they take it, of course, on the responsibility which devolves upon them. But I should like to point out another sacrifice that a very large number of members are making in order that this Bill may be passed into law. It will be remembered that the question as to whether there should be any preference at all to unionists, was the subject of difference of opinion, and that a large number of honourable members on this side-no t by any means a majority of the House, I admit; but a considerable minority-too k a view against preference. The majority of the House decided in favour of preference, which is provided for in the B ill ; and although we do not approve of the principle of preference, we are accepting it as a sacrifice we are willing to make in order that the measure may become law. posite are sacrificing nothing according to the present position. 12 D 2 terruptions to cease before I proceed with my statement. not seem, to like the interjections. at another stage; but when a Government statement is> being made on important matters which are before us for consideration, there ought to be a certain amount of order, especially on the part of those who are familiar with the traditions of office. I was saying that this very provision for preference represents a sacrifice of the strong opinions of a large number of honourable members of the House. honourable gentleman help it ? ia which I could help it. My honourable friend naturally makes that interjection; he belongs to the helpless school of politicians. But I have many ways of helping things which I disapprove of. In the in terests of passing this measure, we should do our best, as far as we conscientiously can, to surrender our individual views. government. and I now think, that I am expressing the views of honourable members opposite as faithfully as my own. They have always liament, in favour of a-compulsory arbitiation law, on this ground-that strife has pushed physical endurance on the part of employers and physical endurance on the part of the workers to 'the last stage, involving tens of thousands of innocent persons in suffering and misery, and that the peaceful arbitrament of these trials of brute strength in a Court of equity was a noble object. not got. acknowledgment of what should be a notorious fact. The very soul of this Bill is not to serve any one's individual interest in business, whether unionist or employer, 'not to make trade unions popular, or to force men to join them. That is not the sphere of a Court of justice; that is not the duty of a judicial tribunal.

Would not our Constitution become a source of degradation; would it not stink in the nostrils of the world, if we used our powers of legislation and our.

I am against preference, but I accept that golden rule which has solved so many practical troubles in politicsI acto limit its operation, and it shall not be cept the principle of majority rule. Many of the most difficult questions which have divided individuals have been solved by that rough, and ready method. And in the interests of this great measure and the noble object which it has in view, we accept loyally!and 'honestly the principle of preference to unionists. The next point is that the late Government acknowledged the difficulty attending this matter. I suppose that the members of that Government will not forget their corporate conscience and intellect now that they sit in opposition.

But, as the Watson Government were prepared to accept the Bill, the principle of preference to unionists was absolutely destroyed, and they were prepared to say: "" We shall not ask for this as a principle; but we are prepared granted unless the party before the Court substantially represents in numbers and competence not only the trade unionists but all the workers engaged' in that calling throughout the Commonwealth.""

It put the Court in the position of a the opinion of the jury-that is the Judge presiding-ther e is a majority favorable to the application, preference should be granted."" So that the difference between the attitude of the late Government and the attitude of the House was a very small one. I point that out to show .that the greatest possible concession made in the interests of the trade unions that could fairly be made. Surely it is a great concession, if a Court of Justice ber of the Government, and those sitting is empowered to give preference to one man Over another in the opportunities of earning his living? If a majority in a calling are willing to place a man in that privileged position, surely that is a large concession to the personal interests,, and the trade interests of trade unions. Much as one admires the spirit of trade unions, much as one recognises the grand work which they have done in elevating the masses in Australia, even the highest and the greatest in the land must be regulated by some consideration for the rights of other persons. And with every desire in the world to help the cause of the trade unions, when we are asked, without any safeguard at all, and in spite of a majority of those in the calling being against it, to create a state of things under which perhaps 250 men in a trade union in Sydney or Melbourne, might get a preference over hundreds and hundreds of their fellow-workmen in the same industry, that in my minddoes not represent a. substantial regard for the position and wishes of the people in those industries. I do not desire at this stage to make any longer statement than is absolutely necessary. I acknowledge with great satisfaction the fact-and a very valuable fact it is -that the Senate has upheld the attitude 'which this House took with reference to the political character of trade unions. I do not wish to diminish the significance of that fact, and, in view of its acceptance otf that provision, the least we can do is to accept a similar provision with reference to the employers. leader of the Opposition is that the Committee should have some time to consider my statement. two first. After the leader of the Opposition has a decision of the Court in respect to thisbeen heard, I suggest that we should go very question of preference to unionists? into Committee on the PapuaB ill , and' resume the discussion of this matter tojury, and it said, "" If, in morrow. the Prime Minister .in going beyond a mere Ministerial statement, and entering into the argumentative aspect of the subject before us, renders it necessary for me to say a word or two, although I do not wish to take up any great amount of time. was I'must express my sense of disappointment that, after assuring the House and the country of the anxiety felt by every membehind it , to have the Bill passed, the right honourable gentleman should appear so little alive to the importance of the position assumed by the Senate, and should evince so little recognition Of what is due to that bod)% as to be prepared to accept only amendments relating to what he has admitted to be matters of absolute] y_ no importance. He spoke of the sacrifice which he and those with him have made in regard to preference, but I would point out that the provision for preference in this measure is but the most vile of pretences. It professes to give to the unionists, the organizations on which, as he has admitted, the Bill is based gentleman has done so. He used that fact as an argument against the inclusion of agricultural labourers and domestic servants. He said, ""They have no organizations, ergo, it is impossible to apply the provisions of the measure to them.""

But where organizations do exist, he is not prepared to admit the need for preserving them, so that the Court may have some machinery by which to carry its awards into effect, and to give value to them. tions themselves will not deal justly.

If we are to attach any importance to the opinions of the Prime Minister with regard to the practical value of the Bill, he is askhas been of such an extraordinary characing us to accept a measure that will be of little or no use. Tfie Prime Minister says, in effect, that he is now offering the labour unions that for which they have been asking for many years, namely, majority rule. knows very well that he is conceding the advantage of majority rule only in instances in which it will be impossible to decide whether there is a majority. He says that the Senate has done its duty marvellously well, and yet he is not prepared to accept the results of their labours. We are not prepared to accept legislation which will prove ineffective. No Bill would be better than a bad one. I recognise that the Prime Minister is very anxious to get into recess, and that he would be happy to see this troublesome Bill out of the road. I can assure him that all his fervent appeals to the patriotism of trade unionists, and his expressions of admiration for them, will have no effect when he tells them that,, alt/hough they ask for bread, he is prepared to give them only a stone. The history of this measure does not reflect much credit upon some of those honourable members who have professed to support it. The Deakin Government went out of office because they would not accept the provision for bringing the public servants of the States within the scope of the measure. The Prime Minister was one of those who voted against the inclusion of the railway servants, and yet he is now ready to swallow a Bill containing that provision, and, at the same time, lay down a rule which will prevent the measure from being applied with any satisfactory results to the great majority of our industrial workers. I shall not be content to allow the Bill to pass until we receive some assurance from the Prime Minister that our labours are not to end in smoke. This is really the only practical measure that has been under consideration this session, and -we are now being asked to accept it in a form in which it will be useless. I shall oppose the motion until some more definite assurance has been given by the Prime Minister. rather surprised at the action of the Government. ever anything but surprised? at anything that the right honourable gentleman may do, because his political record ter that no one need feel astonished at any course he may adopt. I think it is desirable that we should proceed to deal with tbe. Bill at once. No advantage can result from delay. The measure has been The right honourable gentleman very fully debated, both in this Chamber and in the Senate, and no new arguments are likely to be brought to bear upon it. Therefore, a postponement can result in only waste of time. The fact is that the Prime Minister is not prepared to proceed with the consideration of the Senate's amendments in this Bill, because he has not a majority present. Indeed, if the members of the Opposition sit tight it is very questionable whether he can command a majority in favour of an adjournment of this debate. In endeavouring to defer .the consideration of the Bill until fo-morrow, he is acting very shrewdly. Personally, I would rather see the measure discussed, and, if need be, thrown out this afternoon. I notice that there is a conference between the Prime Minister and the Government whip. Probably the latter has informed the right honourable gentleman that he has not a majority present. opposite. the reason the Prime Minister does not desire to proceed with the Bill this afternoon is .that he cannot command a majority.

Those who are most interested in the Papua Bill will probably be absent for hours, under the impression that the debate upon the Senate's amendments in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill will occupy some time. that the Prime Minister will agree that up to the present time. I have occupied very little time in discussing the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. I can assure honourable -members, however, that the inclusion of domestic servants within its scope commands my whole-souled support. term "" slaveys "" has to a great extent been warranted by reason of the extremely long hours which this class of employees have been compelled to work. I admit that in Australia they enjoy a little more freedom than they do in England, and that they are better treated, though they do not receive t'he consideration which they deserve. But I would point out to the Prime Minister that in the constituency of Melbourne 40 per cent, of the domestic servants who were entitled to vote at the last election were practically disfranchised. In many cases they were most severely treated by their mistresses, who drove them to the polling booths and took good care to ascertain how they voted. I claim that it is unjust to make any distinction as -between citizen and citizen. member for Kennedy that it is idle to traverse old ground in discussing this measure. If the numbers are up, I am perfectly prepared to come to a division without delay, and to rely upon the Senate, which has proved itself to be the more democratic Chamber of the two, to again return the amendments which it has already inserted in this measure. If .we cannot then come to an agreement, I think that there should be an appeal to the country. Personally, I should be very loth to see that course adopted. The Prime Minister can readily understand that any person w'ho has been compelled to contest two elections and a suit before the High Court within four and a half months is not particularly anxious to see a general election. Nevertheless, I feel so strongly upon this matter that I am prepared to face that ordeal, if necessary. I trust that the conflict upon this measure will be short, sharp, and decisive.

It seems to me that the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Cowper and others who support the proposed hew clause will not hold water. To seek to apply a prohibition law to such a territory as that of British New Guinea would be to endeavour to do something absolutely. impracticable. With a coast-line and borders that can be approached from any point, British New Guinea would offer considerable inducements to smuggling and to the illicit distillation of liquors. It must also be remembered that the island of New Guinea does not belong entirely to the Commonwealth. tions of it which are under the control of Germany and Holland. would be exce*edingly difficult to apply a proshow that the missionaries, by ten to one, hibitive law effectively to that portion of the island which is under our own control.

Unfortunately, we have no reliable statistics on the subject: If we had it would no doubt be shown that liquor is consumed in British New Guinea both by coloured people and understood whites. There is no better way to control the traffic than to put it under Government management. I am satisfied that that is the safest plan which we can adopt. The opinions of missionaries who have been in the island from five to seventeen or eighteen years show us that it would not be safe to prohibit the importation of liquor absolutely. The amendment of the honourable member for Herbert would permit of its use for medicinal purposes, and under the instructions of medical men. We ought to regard the opinions of such people as missionaries and doctors, and who all tell us that liquor is essential in such a climate as prevails in the Possession. then? have other articles of consumption which serve the same purpose, and which they like better than the liquor which is drunk by civilized communities. Those who are living on the spot are far better qualified to There are two porgive an opinion on the subject than we are.

I am beginning to understand how far one can go in discussing matters in Committee, and I should not be allowed to discuss the question of land settlement on the amendment now before us. I shall oppose the application to the Territory of prohibition. is much to recommend the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and also .the amendment upon it moved by the honourable member for Herbert. When this Bill was before the last Parliament, it will be found on reference to page 2995 of Hansard, that on the 4th August, 1903, I moved an amendment in the following words :Notwithstanding anything contained in any ordinance there shall be no sale or dealing in intoxicating liquor or opium in the Territory, except by the agents of the Lieutenant-Governor, and the receipts therefrom shall go into the Treabe effective to attain the object which the sury of the Territory. I still hold the opinions which I then submitted, the reasons for which will be found in Hansard of that date; and when I hadthe honour to administer the Department of External Affairs, differences of opinion as to the wisdom either of prohibiting or assigning to the State weighed so much with the Department that I decided to lay the Bill before the House practically as it now stands. shall be, in favour of having this traffic under the direct control of the State. I prefer that to prohibition, because I consider that the reason for prohibition, which I admit is usually tenfold strong where one has to deal with native races, is absent in this particular case, since, as I am credibly informed, the natives of New Guinea have absolutely no leaning towards liquor in any shape -or form. and learned member think that it would be wise to keep it away from them, in order that they might be prevented from acquiring a taste for it? ample opportunities for getting liquor as have the aborigines of Australia. If the honourable member for Lang has any experience of the blacks of this country, 1 he must be aware that, in spite of the law, which is very stringent, a blackfellow can and will get drink, and does get opium. the Fly River take liquor as fast as it was given to them. Australia has been that opium or liquor can be bought at any time in this country in spite of the law. Liquor can be secured by black or white, on Sundays or week days, and in spite of Customs law or climate. I am told, and I must believe the statement, rhat, as a matter of fact, the natives of New Guinea have no desire for liquor, and I hope they never will have such a desire. I am exceedingly thankful to be able to say that personally I have no desire for it, and I believe that those people who have an unquenchable desire for liquor are perhaps more to be pitied than is any class of people on the face of God's earth. I do not believe that the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Herbert will honourable member desires, and I therefore propose to submit a new clause in the form of the amendment which I moved on the 4th August of last year, and which I have already quoted. The honourable member for Herbert proposes thatNo intoxicant or opium shall be allowed to be imported into or manufactured or sold or otherwise disposed of in the Territory, except under Government control. ""Government control"" there might meanPersonally I am, and always nothing more than Government supervision. That is to say that the Government might appoint any person to sell liquor, just as persons, are appointed to sell stamps. WhatI believe the honourable member wants, and what I'desire, is to make the Government itself the sole purveyor, manufacturer, and importer of these articles. I believe that would be provided for by the amendment I suggest. Any delegation of the power of "" "" the Government to any individual would,",29,Papua British New Guinea

It must be remembered that the Government, as here understood, is not only the Cabinet or Executive, but also any subordinate body authorized to act on behalf of the Government. amendment presents the question, prohibition versus tbe present condition of things. The honourable member for Lang is very earnest in this matter; but I presume that he would infinitely prefer effective regulation and control to the present loose, unsatisfactory method. Whether that be so or not, it ought to be pointed out that the effect of the amendment is merely to permit !the present system to continue. DoI understand you, sir, to rule that it would be out of order to move the new clause I had suggested ? new clause would be sufficiently near to an amendment previously disposed of to prevent its being discussed. It is impossible for the Committee to go oyer ground already traversed; and if the Committee came to the decision that they would not agree to the amendment of the honourable member -for Herbert, honourable members were against Government or State control. Honourable members will understand that I am not supposed to give decisions with regard to legal interpretation, but only to state what, in my opinion, would be the effect of certain words if they were incorporated in the B ill. I am afraid that I shall be compelled to rule that the suggested new clause has already been discussed by the Committee, and a decision arrived at. The suggestion has' been made that the Committee might decide the principle on this amendment, and that it would then be competent for the Committee to further amend the clause in the direction suggested, because that would be quite in consonance with the amendment arrived at. orable member for Herbert that he should insert the word "" direct"" before "" control,"" which would indicate with sufficient clearness to the Committee what the amendment would serve to do. If the amendment of the 'honourable member for' Melbourne Ports should be defeated, and the clause as amended by 'the ^honourable member for ""Government control"" Herbert accepted, then we might, as the Chairman has suggested, introduce such other words as would give effect to our intention. willing 'to accept the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for West Sydney.

Getting the amendments into line is a matter for subsequent consideration, when the principle has been affirmed. I desire to say a word against the proposal submitted for bringing about a drastic alteration regarding the drink traffic in New Guinea. I have always understood that when alterations of the kind are suggested, it is customary to give some consideration to I suggest to the honthe wishes of the people affected, and to endeavour to obtain from them an expression of opinion.

We find that although expressions of opinion by missionaries and Government officers have been laid before us, the opinions of men who have been resident in the Territory for periods ranging from five to twenty years, and who know the conditions thoroughly, are thrown aside. Those men are opposed to the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and it is only rightthat, as they will be affected by any radical alteration, their opinion should receive consideration. Any reform of the kind, if -reform it be, must, in order to be permanent, bo based on the concurrence of those affected. We find that a number of honourable members say to the 600 white residents of the Territory, "" Upon no consideration shall you have liquor, unless you are sick. Although you may be prospecting in those wild lands, and may run the risk of catching malarial fever, yet until such time as it is contracted, you are not .to be permitted to get liquor."" The honourable member for Franklin is laughing; but did not the honourable member for Melbourne Ports propose that until a man got sick, and required liquor for medicinal purposes, it should not be obtainable?

The Arms, Liquor, and Opium Prohibition Ordinance of 1888. imposes very severe restrictions upon the white population as regards supplying drink to the natives. In section 1, it says"" Native"" shall mean and include in its reference every person in the Possession not of European descent. It will be generally admitted that that definition covers most of the residents in British New Guinea. Section2 of the Ordinance saysNo person shall, except as hereinafter permitted., supply to any native by sale, g if t, or in any other way, either directly or indirectly, any firearm, ammunition, explosive, intoxicating liquor, or opium; and any person offending against any provision of this section, shall, on conviction in a summary manner, be liable to a fine of not less than ^20 and not exceeding £200, and to imprisonment for any term not less than one month and not exceeding-two years. My honourable friends will admit that the restriction contained in that section is a pretty severe one. The conditions upon which drink may be supplied to a native are laid down in section 7, which reads as follows:It shall not be an offence under this ordinance for any person to give to any native, for any urgent cause or necessity, and without recompense or remuneration, any intoxicating liquor when such intoxicating liquor is given solely and purely for medical purposes, but it will rest with the person giving such intoxicating liquor to prove to the satisfaction of the Court the existence of such urgent necessity, and failing such proof, in a clear and conclusive manner, such person shall be liable to the penalty provided in seetion 3 hereof. In face of the barriers against the natives getting drink, and the statements from the missionaries that the natives do not get drink, and have no desire to get it, we should not impose restrictions upon men who desire to get a reasonable supply of liquor without first getting an expression of opinion from them. If the majority of the people in this Territory were' to express directly their opposition to the admission of drink, I should say that their will ought to be reproposal for Government control gives good of New Guinea are not getting drink under the present control.",31,Papua British New Guinea

My honourable friends must know that it is difficult for white men to live for any length of time in this Territory. It has been proved by past experience that no other remedy for malarial fever is so speedy as quinine and brandy. On the island, quinine is an absolute necessity to a white man, and it cannot be properly administered without brandy. I should not be so greatly opposed to this proposal if a man were permitted to take a supply of brandy with him when going to the interior. is no medical practitioner, men often get sick and require liquor for medicinal purposes.

267,Mr Brown,"There is no doubt thathibition cannot be applied to the Territory, it will toe open to us to adopt some other system to cope with the evil. believe that the most effective course to adopt would be that of placing the traffic under State control. Whilst the missionaries, whose evidence has been placed before us, are opposed to prohibition, they show that the present system is far from what could be desired. They claim ""that the drink traffic has not extended to any perceptible degree to the coloured races, but they admit that it is having a demoralizing effect on the white residents, and therefore its indirect influence on the natives must also be demoralizing. They tell us of scenes that are enacted on the gold-fields which certainly are not creditable, and I think we should endeavour to put an end to them. In the interests of the coloured races of British New GuineaI propose to vote for prohibition. If the experiment proves to be a failure, I shall then be ready to join with others in an effort to meet the evil in some other way. not have spoken, but for the statement made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh that at Thursday Island and Bundaberg there were Kanakas in charge of hotels. I wish to deny that assertion. The liquor laws of Queensland are even stricter than are those of Victoria: From many years' experience as a licensing magistrate, I can say that a license is not issued to either a Kanaka or any other coloured person in Queensland. When this B ill was before us last session I voted for the proposed new clause, and I intend to do so again, unless it be withdrawn in favour of that -foreshadowed by the, hondrable member for Cowper. orable member for Cowper's proposal. Friday last that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports had withdrawn his amendment. posed new clause foreshadowed by the honourable member for Cowper would be an improvement on that moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, although I think that the latter would carry out the object that we have in view. The principle of prohibition, which we have been discussing, has been advocated for many years, and I regard it as a very important one. We are now passing a law I for the administration of a new Territory, arid I think we should avail ourselves of the opportunity to put the principle to the test, and see how it will work. Papua, so far, is inhabited by a few hundred white persons, and some hundreds of thousands of native races, and I think that we ought to put the principle of prohibition to the test before any vested interests are created there. It would be difficult, for instance, to apply prohibition to Victoria, because of vested interests. inconvenient for many of us. would. Like the right honourable member for Swan, I occasionally take spirits for medicinal purposes. We are told in the Scriptures that we should use a .little wine for our stomachs' sakes.

The natives have very decided alien restriction legislation, so that there is very little inducement for visits from white men. One adult one vote is a sound democratic principle, but it appears that we have to give it up because of our inability to reconcile it with other legislation we have passed. I agree with the honourable member for Canobolas, that it seems rather extraordinary that we should have refused the white residents the power to elect their own Government and deal with their own affairs, while in the matter of the liquor traffic we are invited to allow them to decide for themselves. I voted previously for the State control of the liquor traffic, because I thought that the most practicable method; and the mover of the amendment, if he favours a vote of the white people-whic h I am not disposed to oppose-ough t to provide that they shall decide whether, there should be State control. If the power be given to the white residents, I desire to see it provided that they may decide whether there shall be prohibition or State control of the liquor traffic, though they have already been denied a measure of self government. I am sure that none of us would like any outside body to interfere with the liquor traffic so far as it concerns ourselves, because, while such interference might not affect all of us personally, there is a principle involved. I am opposed to an unrestricted liquor traffic in New Guinea, and desire it to be made clear that no drink shall be sold to the natives.

New Guinea depends on whisky? but, judging by the evidence of those who know New Guinea, as neither myself nor the honourable member does, it is evident that they think the point of immense importance. the land question-that if we dealt with that question as we proposed, we might as well "" shut up "" New Guinea. have said that. able member that they have. unalterable. whilst it is not necessary to waste time, I think that the suggestion that a poll of the white residents of New Guinea should be taken might be reasonably considered by those who desire that liquor shall not be imported into the Territory. Whether it be limited to them or not is a matter of detail, though I do not think that there is any practicable value in the suggestion of the honourable member. With regard to tlie remarks of the honourable member for Canobolas, the law at present prohibits the supplying of liquor to natives, and if local option is carried it can be made clear that the prohibition affecting natives will still be retained in the Constitution.

He tried to show an analogy European residents ! between a land policy and what is a matter of personal taste. The question of land alienation is one with which we can deal broadly in the interests of the natives, of the white population of New Guinea, and of Australia as a whole. The liquor question, however, is a different matter. I think that any reasonable community will We have obtained the agree that the individual should decide for himself whether he will drink alcoholic beverages, or be contented with water, and I intend, therefore, to support the honourable member for Fremantle in proposing what I thought embodied the whole principle for which reasonable teetotallers have fought.

340,Mr Robinson,"Fo r the past nineIt is a most astonishing thing to me to find the honourable members for Lang and Cowper advocating the most extreme restrictionist policy which could be imagined. The extent to which they are carrying their ideas is indicated by the fact that they are prepared to prevent white settlers from having any voice as to what liquor they shall consume. Notwithstanding that a Local Option Bill has been described as a measure to permit one man to prevent another man from having a glass of grog, yet there is a good deal to be said in favour of the principle. But those honourable members do not believe in local option. All they wish to do is to prevent other persons from satisfying a natural desire. able member can rope a man in and pin him fast to some idea, he will. It saddens me to see my honourable friends on this side who have been such ardent champions for liberty refusing to grant ordinary liberty to the people of New Guinea. I am informed that those on this side who voted for the prohibition amendment say, "" In this Constitution, we have refused a vote to the white settlers,"" and on that analogy they attempt to argue that therefore prohibition is necessary on the island, A more confused idea of logic I have never yet heard. not give the people of the island a vote for everything, why give them a vote with respect to one thing? to trust the Executive council of the Territory ; but the honourable member will not go to that length. Any one who 'has read the printed evidence carefully and dispassionately must come to the conclusion that the existing restrictions are sufficient for any to, have a temperance drink, and I took it. reasonable-minded man; with one exception, every clergyman and missionary said that they are. A considerable number of missionaries and clergymen said that, although they had been strict teetotallers on the Continent, yet the climate of the island was such that a glass of alcoholic liquor under some circumstances was absolutely essential. In spite of that evidence, honourable members insist upon thrusting their ideas on the people of New Guinea. Like most 'honourable members, I was approached at the last general election by the party advocating prohibition, and this local option amendment meets exactly the views which I then advocated. Victoria is against anything of the kind. It is confusing principles when the honourable and learned member' says that this is a local option amendment. tioned at the last general election as to this vote, I took an attitude which I can fit in exactly with this local option amendment. I said that I should allow the white residents to decide whether they should have liquor or not, but that I would prohibit liquor being supplied in any form to the natives, and empower the Government to fine in the heaviest possible manner any person found guilty of that offence, and to confiscate the liquor. The amendment before the Chamber carries out the idea here. I then expressed myself as being in favor of local option, and the amendment, which the honourable and learned member for Bendigo has given notice of will carry out the other idea. Those who believe in temperate living, and in a temperate consumption of alcoholic liquor as I do, ought to support the amendment. Only upon one occasion since I have been a Member of Parliament, which has been for about three years, have I consumed liquor in Parliament House, and that was when three gentlemen who have just voted for total prohibition, persuaded me to join them. and I had a ""soft"" drink. While I am temperate in the consumption of liquor, I am also temperate in applying my temperance principles to other persons. When I joined those three prohibitionists, I did not seek to force my will upon them. They wanted alcoholic drink, and I let them have it. All I asked for was that I should be allowed The amendment of the honourable member for Fremantle ought to be supported by reasonable-minded men who believe in temperance, live temperately, and wish to see other people doing the same. Coupled with the amendment given notice of by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, it should remove all reasonable ground for suspicion that the natives might be injured by the consumption of liquor in any shape or form. pose the amendment, because, on general principles, I am in favour of local option.

The recent division indicated very plainly the opinion of the Committee on this subject. I do not speak merely as a total abstainer, but I look upon this question as one which demands that we shall pay regard to the interests of the majority of the people concerned. The honourable member for K a l goorlie has stated that the majority of the people are entitled to have their wishes respected. In this case we represent the majority of the people-the 400,000 natives who live in the Possession-and we are bound to legislate in their interests. We are told that the natives are not able to obtain drink, and that there is no danger of opportunities being presented to them for cultivating a. taste for it. We have evidence, however, that some of the natives do obtain drink. kind is reported. been many others, because, as has been pointed out, it would have been impossible for the white residents in Papua to consume all the liquor imported into the Possession. It is a pity that confusion should have arisen, and that honourable members .were not free to vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Herbert as an alternative to the proposal contained in the clause as proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I trust that whatever may be the opinions of honourable members with regard to local option as a broad' principle, they will not 'think of applying it to the case of New Guinea, but that they will fully consider the claims of the blacks to protection from the evils of the drink traffic. the local option principle were applied to the case of New Guinea, the 600 white residents would have the right to impose drink upon the 400,000 natives. at present prohibiting the sale of liquor to the natives. understand that the 400,000 blacks are to have votes-that the missionaries in the stomachs of the cannibals will be entitled to vote on this question? The white residents should not be permitted to shape and I take it mar the destinies of the 400,000 natives. The white residents went to New Guinea to better their financial positions. They did not go there for their health, or because of their love of country, or of the blacks. They went there to make a profit out of the blackfellows, and they are entitled to exactly the same rights as the natives enjoy, and no more. the United States entitled to vote? are not allowed to have drink. British New Guinea. supplies an Indian with drink, he is very quickly transferred to dry Tartugas. There is no analogy between the cases in the United States which embraces a well-administered territory 4.000 miles long by 3,400 miles broad, and that of Papua. British New Guinea is far removed from the centre of government, and we should not permit the few white people there to run the country. I shall vote against permitting 600 white men to poison 400,000 natives. If the white settlers are not satisfied to live in New Guinea they should leave it. not wish' to prolong the debate, but I have heard so much with regard to the dire results to the natives that are expected to follow the sale of intoxicants to white persons in British New Guinea, that I desire to say a word or two. I believe that for every aboriginal who has died in Australia from the effects of alcohol fully a hundred have succumbed to diseases brought here by the white race. I have had some experience, and I have lived long enough to know how the aborigines in the settled districts of Western Australia were almost removed from the face of the earth. If other honourable meTnbers are old enough to remember the conditions under which the aboriginals in other States have been decimated, they will bear me out when I say that the evils of drink, so far as they apply to the aborigines, although regrettable, have been overN o ; there is an ordinance stated.

The havoc wrought amongst them by disease has been far greater than that which has resulted from the use of strong drink. Of course, in some of the towns decrepit and demoralized aborigines are to be seen, but these bear no comparison to the many hundreds of aborigines to be found in other parts of the State, who know little about strong drink. In the northern parts of Western Australia, of which I have personal knowledge, except for a few aborigines who are to be found in the towns, the natives obtain no strong drink whatever. The natives along the north-west coast and in the Kimberley district, except in a few towns, have no means whatever of obtaining intoxicants, and the laws are very stringent in punishing any one supplying it to them. It is very easy to make sweeping statements to the effect that our aborigines have been decimated owing to the excessive use of intoxicants, but in comparison with other influences which have tended to thin their ranks far fewer deaths can be attributed to the drink evil. Statements have been made, which I do not care to pass unchallenged, in reference to the .terrible cruelties practised upon the aborigines by the pioneers of this continent. those wise-acres who talk so glibly in that manner in the position of the early settlers of Australia, and to see how they would act in face of the trials, difficulties, and dangers by which they were confronted. It is all very well for the honourable member for Franklin to talk about a "" black page "" in our history, but he should recollect that in making observations of that character he is reflecting upon those whom we are most proud of. I have no sympathy with the desire of the total abstainers in this House, who wish to apply their theories to the far-off country of New Guinea. I think it would be much more reasonable if they sought to give effect to their principles much nearer home. Most of us possess very little knowledge of New Guinea, and apparently some hpnorable members are not prepared to respect the opinions of those who have had experience of it. I regard the proposal under, discussion as altogether too drastic in character. I do not see why we should prohibit the importation, of intoxicants into the Terfittest has prevailed. Despite all the senritory, for the use of the white population.' seeing that in other parts of the Pacific Ocean, where the aborigines have Sir John Forrest. come into contact with white men under British rule, effect has not been given to such an extreme proposal. 1 do not know that the Fijians have been decimated owing to intoxicants being sold to white persons in the islands which they inhabit, under strict supervision. Of course, nobody desires that the natives should be allowed to obtain drink, nor does any one wish to see the aborigines injured. I am very glad indeed to find that honourable members are animated by such a strong feeling of brotherly love for the natives of New Guinea. It , however, contrasts strangely with the sentiments which I have heard so often expressed upon previous occasions with regard to coloured races. Personally, I see no reason why a resident of New Guinea should be absolutely prevented from keeping within his own bouse whatever wines, spirits, or beer he may require. right honourable member that the proposal under consideration has reference to local option. option to no option at all, and, therefore, I shall support any proposal in preference to one for the enforcement of absolute prohibition. to me that this question resolves itself into whether seventy-five members of this House -mos t of whom know little or nothing of the conditions obtaining in New Guinea-ar e going to declare that intoxicants shall not be introduced into the Territory, or whether the 500 or 600 white residents there shall be allowed to determine the matter for themselves. I am of opinion that it. would be safer to adopt the latter course, and consequently I shall support the 'amendment of the honourable member for Fremantle. A great deal of false sentiment has been uttered in reference to this question. As an Australian of fifty years' standing, I repudiate a good deal of what has been said concerning the treatment of the aborigines, and, in this connection, I can endorse most of the remarks of the right honourable member for Swan.

This provision puts too great a power in the hands of the medical practitioner. It simply means tfhat the doctors in New Guinea can grant a man the right to have all the whisky he wants. If we pass the amendment we shall simply turn British New Guinea into a whisky saloon to be run by doctors. If my honourable friend the member for Cowper had been in the American prohibition States in former days he would see the weakness of his idea.

Other members of the Committee are just as anxious as are honourable members who are advocating temperance that no liquor should be supplied to the natives. The regulations already in existence provide for that. In these days a' man can purchase a still for ^ 2 5 , and these stills can be set up in New Guinea in a learned member suggests that if we make scrub through half-a-mile of wbich honourable members could not walk in a day. It will be impossible to prevent illicit distillation in New Guinea. We are telling the white residents of New Guinea, who are largely miners, who do not care twopence for laws of which they do not approve, that they shall not be able to get a glass of liquor, and as a result there will be many illicit stills established in ihe Territory, and twenty times as much liquor will be sold to natives as would otherwise have been sold. I object that honourable members who advocate temperance, and whose votes have shown how intemperate they really are, should suggest that other honourable members are not as anxious to prevent the sale of liquor to the natives of the Territory. It is, in my opinion, disgraceful that we should propose laws of this restrictive character. In New South Wales some twenty odd years ago, the duty on liquor was raised from 12s. to 14s. a gallon. I was surveying at the time, and I am in a position to say that as the result of the increase of the duty, twelve months afterwards I could have pointed .to illicit stills throughout the district in which I was engaged which had A medical never previously existed. We are to-day continually hearing of persons in the settled portions of Victoria and of New South Wales being fined up to £ 1 0 0 for having illicit stills. In some cases the attempt to promote temperance has had exactly tbe opposite effect, and it has led to the illicit distillation of bad spirits, which has been detrimental to the health of the people, as well as to the revenue. If the Committee is really in earnest in desiring to promote temperance amongst the natives. of British New Guinea, they The chief argument used in will do nothing which will lead to illicit distillation. I remind honourable members that there is an inland border, extending intemperate, they for 800 or 900 miles between Dutch New Guinea and British New Guinea, and it will be impossible to prevent natives being engaged in the smuggling of spirits across that border. In the circumstances, if is It is too absurd absolutely ridiculous for us to insist on passing this clause.

I had been prepared to follow blindly the honourable member for Cowper; so much so that I had not taken the trouble to peruse the proposal, really thinking that the honourable member for Cowper was sincere and honest on the question. I had, perhaps, some little doubt as to whether it would be advisable to prohibit liquor in the case of those engaged in prospecting and kindred pursuits; but we were informed by the honourable member for Cowper that Dr. Livingstone^ Stanley, and others had stated that drink under such circumstances is not necessary-that such work is better done without intoxicants. Yet here we have the honourable member for Cowper practically giving away the whole case, and prepared to permit doctors, or any other persons duly authorized by the Lieutenant-Governor, to dispense drink as medicine. Such a condition of things I regard as worse than State control, against which a number of us voted a little while ago. The present Prime Minister and his two predecessors are all in 'favour of allowing intoxicants under certain conditions, on the The majority of honourable ground that it is practically impossible for white people to live in such .a country without such stimulants.

K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A In Committee (Consideration resumed from 14th October, vide page 5629): Clause1 agreed to. Clause2 (Power to make survey of route). considerable regret that I rise to propose an amendment in a Bill in which a number of honourable members, including the right honourable member for Swan, take so keen an interest. I find myself in this position : I voted originally for the consideration of the measure, and afterwards for the second reading, because I wished to test in Committee the question which is at the bottom of my amendment. I have voted for the Bill so far, although I am opposed to the construction of the railway, because I wish now to prove whether or not the Western Australian representatives think that the verdict of the survey will be favorable to the construction of the line. Sir member is not asked to vote for the construction of the railway now. to the construction of the railway, I must also, in order to be consistent, oppose the initial expenditure now contemplated ? I merely wish now to ascertain whether the representatives of Western Australia are prepared to back their opinion that the railway will prove a great success as a business undertaking. I move That tlie following proviso be added :"" Provided that the States of Western Australia and South Australia, collectively or individually, undertake to refund to the Commonwealth the cost of this survey, in the event of the Commonwealth not deciding within two (2) years of the completion to construct the said railway."" will, under my amendment, have an opportunity of proving that the railway is likely to be a good Commonwealth invesfment. They tell us it will prove of such a nature. carelessly accept their assurances. are here as the trustees of the Commonwealth, and we are not entitled to spend money contributed by the whole of the States upon a work of this kind, unless we have some guarantee such as will be afforded by the proviso. . This Bill, alreport though almost universally unpopular, has been pushed to the forefront because the representatives of Western Australia have consistently presented a solid front in advocating it. Successive Governments have felt themselves compelled , owing to the exigen1 cies of the political situation, to push for' ward the measure. The Bill, instead of being where it would long ago have been deposited if the feeling of the people of Australia could have been properly sounded, namely, in the waste-paper basket, has been in the forefront of every Government programme. Honourable members who are advocating the railway, say that it will prove a good business investment. If their views are found to be well founded, my proviso will have no effect, because it will come into force only in the event of the Commonwealth deciding not to construct the line. That is the main point upon which I depend for support -Surely we should not be called upon to pay for an experiment which, in the event of our afterwards not being prepared to construct the line, would not have conferred any benefit upon any but the two States immediately concerned. If we build the railway, we pay JOHN FORREST -The honourable for the survey; if we do not build the railway, the States whose representatives misled the Commonwealth into expending this money are to reimburse the amount-that is my proviso. The right honourable member for Swan and other representatives of Western Australia have told us that it is not only upon the ground of the cost involved that they appeal to this Parliament. They have informed us time and again that Western Australia cannot make any progress in this matter, because South Australia will not join in making the survey. I would point out, however, that if South Australia objects to the construfction of the line, the Commonwealth will be powerless to proceed with the work. Subr section x x x i v . of section 51 of the Constitution confers upon the Commonwealth The States concerned power to construct railways through the territory of any State with the consent of that State.

I do not think that any State would care to have the principle which he wishes to establish applied to proposals for public works within its borders. that principle is an utterly objectionable one. To provide that either South Australia or Western Australia, or both, should refund this money, if the line were not authorized within two years, would practically impose a legal obligation upon those States, from which they could not escape.

I can assure the honourable member that every proposal will receive my best consideration. By a large majority the House has affirmed the principle involved in the proposed survey. In Committee expression was given to the view that a certain area of land should be reserved upon either side of the proposed route, and the Parliament of Western Australia has given effect to our wishes in a way which I have never seen equalled. Both Houses of the State Legislature have guaranteed that an area of twenty-five miles on either side of the projected route shall be reserved. tralia ? comes in.

I was very much gratified with the decision of the Committee to sanction the survey, with a view to ascertaining whether the enterprise is likely to prove justifiable from an Australian standpoint. The indirect results arising from an examination of this route may prove of vast importance.

We are not dealing now with the question of reservation of land. to show generally what I intended to convey on the occasion in question. I then expressed the opinion that we should either require the Governments of South Australia and Western Australia to find the money necessary to make this survey in the first place, on the understanding that it would be refunded in the event of the Commonwealth Parliament determining to construct the line; or that they should, as I have said, reserve the land for a distance of twenty-five miles on either side of the proposed route. learned member know the monetary equivalent of this reservation of the land on either side? that any one knows. land on the Western Australian side of the border would yield only £ 7 , 2 0 0 per annum. orable member does not yet know with certainty the nature of the country. aware that a committee of engineers, including Mr Deane, the Engineer-inChief for New South Wales, has expressed the opinion that in a very few years the railway would pay, and that the country through which it would run is of such a character as to make it at least worthwhile to carry out a . survey. If, ber for Swan reports, the lands which have been reserved will become valuable structed, we should be able to stipulate when the Bill providing for the construcI understand tion of the line comes before the House, that the proceeds derived from the reservation be paid into a trust fund to recoup the Commonwealth for any loss upon the railway. That being so, I am perfectly satisfied now to support this Bill, providing for an expenditure of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 on the survey, without the stipulation for which the honourable member for Wentworth asks. In their own State. I mention this only to show that I have not changed my opinion, but that I ithink that the Western Australian Government, in so quickly responding to the wish exI think the honorpressed by the House, have given a substantial earnest of their desire for the construction of the line. We shall be able byZ-and'-by, if the survey proves a very satisfactory one, to stipulate for some I merely wish substantial guarantee from both States in consideration of their having so large a sum of money expended upon the survey. very strongly opposed to this proposed survey at the present time, I have hitherto preserved silence, out of deference to the feelings of the right honourable member for Swan and the honourable member for Perth.

If South Australia adopted the same course the loss would be reduced by another £7,000 or £8,000 per annum, leaving a total loss of between £50,000 and £60,000 a year, if the whole of the land on either side of the railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta were reserved and leased in this way. These facts cannot be gainsaid. The Government of Western Australia offer liberal conditions to those who wish to take up land, and yet no one will touch this part of the country. The reservation, therefore, is practically of very little value. iimclcGrc]. amendment moved by the honourable member for Wentworth would protect the revenue of the other States, and I am sure that --hose who favour it would accept the suggestion made by the honourable member for Maranoa, 'hat the time limit be altered from two to five years. I desire to move several amendments, which, I believe, will meet with the approval of the Committee. First of all, I would strike out the words ""collectively or individually,"" and insert the words ""or one of those States."" That would be in accordance with the suggestion which has been made by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne.

But that is beside the question.

Sir JOHN.FORREST -What has Victoria got out of Western Australia? There is'no income tax in Western Australia, such as we in the other States have to pay. Why does not the Western Australian Government take advantage of the advice of the Bulletin, and other newspapers, and impose proper taxation? Why does Western Australia need to come here and ask us for £20,000 ? I really think that the people of that State will take it as an insult if we vote this money. That is how I feel upon the subject, and it is only my high esteem for the representatives of Western Australia that has kept me quiet so long. I move That the amendment be amended by leaving out the words "" collectively or individually,"" and inserting in lieu thereof the words "" or one of these States"" ; that the word "" two "" be left out, The with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" f i v e "" ; and that after the word ""completion"" the word ""thereof"" be inserted. I ask whether the vote on the amendments of the amendment will decide the whole question ? merely verbal amendments, which do not touch the principle of the proviso, the insertion of which has been moved by the honourable member for Wentworth. cide the whole question by a vote upon the first of the amendments of the honourable and learned member for Wannon? taken on the proviso, as amended. Amendments of the amendment agreed to. very sorry that I should have to speak upon the amendment of the honourable member for Wentworth.

If these hard-working men had gone away from Victoria to a'place where they were unable to save money they could not have sent £2,000,00 0 back to their families in Victoria, as has, I am pleased to say, been the case with those who went to Western Australia.

ProbablyI can see more plainly than do other members of the Committee that honourable members of this generation must die and a new generation be born before this Parliament will become national. Every question discussed in this House is discussed from the village blacksmith stand-point. The honourable member for Maranoa talks of the great State of Queensland being in -a state of starvation. members are talking of what Victoria has done for Western Australia. I say that, ten or twelve years ago, Western Australia was' a god-send to Victoria. That State was the promised land, flowing with milk and honey, and people from Victoria went over there by every boat they could get to carry them. Many of them filled their pockets with gold and sent it back to their wives and children in this State. Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been sent through the post-office from Western Australia to Victoria, and Victorians should be the last to oppose this proposal, involving a paltry £ 2 0 , 0 0 0. If he were imbued, with a truly national spirit, the honourable member for Wentworth would think nothing of paying the amount out of his own pocket. I remind honourable members that men and women who are subject to seasickness must, to Western Australia. Years ago, when, in the United States, they started the Union Pacific Railway across the continent, no one was ever heard to oppose it . Every man and woman on the American continent helped to build it, because it was a national work, and meant connecting and cementing We know the people of all parts of the United States. ment work?

But the genius of the American people enabled them to strike the magic rock, water was poured forth, and that country was made one of the most productive in the world. We ought to awaken from our sleep, and make the country between Fort Augusta and Kalgoorlie smile and blossom like the rose. I was amazed to hear the honourable member for Wentworth suggest that Western Australia should, in a certain contingency, repay this money. Suppose this Parliament, in its wisdom, or unwisdom, should in a few years decide not to carry on the work, would that be the fault of Western Australia?

MrM c WILLIAMS Federal Parliament at the time, but had I been, I should not have supported .that subsidy. We are not asked to be just, but to be generous, to Western Australia, and it is also right that we should be just and generous to the rest of the (Commonwealth. If there were a proposal to continue railway -communication from the terminus in Queensland to the far North or the far West, would it receive the support of Western Australian representatives? In my opinion, it is all -clap-trap to talk of this Inter-State line as necessary for defence purposes; I do not -believe that is a fair and honest view. If we are prepared to give direct railway communication with Western Australia, let us do so with our eyes open; but do not let honourable members say that this proposed vote is part of the defence expenditure. for the construction of the railway, but not the only reason. which were put forward by the right honourable member for Swan why we should not insert the amendment, and should carry the Bill as it stands, was that some thousands of persons had gone from Victoria to Western Australia, and were maintaining their families here. I am one of those who say that in the matter of that exodus Western Australia has had the best of the deal. Since Western Australia received the best men of Victoria, even if they do send a portion of their earnings to their families, it is decidedly the gainer, and to that extent Victoria is the loser. I think that the people of Victoria and their representatives would not be sorry to see -some thousands of able-bodied men come from other States, and earn good wages here, even if they did send remittances to their families. if Victoria had good laws such as Western Australia has. MrM c WILLIAM S The honourable member for Darwin will bear me out when -I say that some thousands of able-bodied Victorians came to the West Coast of Tasmania, and did there exactly what the right honourable member for Swan says Victorians are doing in Western Australia. I consider that there, too, Tasmania had the best of the deal. If the Government and the Parliament of the Commonwealth are in earnest, this vote is being passed with a distinct determination to construct the railway if the report on the survey be I was not in the favorable. Buti f it is simply, as the honourable and learned member for Wannon said, a political or personal proposal, the Committee has no right to pass it, unless, of course, it is intended to construct the railway if the report on the survey be favorable. If the report be favorable, and the railway be constructed, Western Australia will never be asked to contribute a shilling, towards its cost. It is not fair to handicap States like Queensland and Tasmania-in which public works are stopped, if not absolutely, to a very considerable extent, because of the condition of the finances-with what is not, I hold, a legitimate charge upon the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Darwin has given us a glowing picture of what has happened in the United States. But he did not mention how many years the States had been federated before that railway was undertaken, nor did he say that it was undertaken by a company for which the Government are not -responsible, and over which the people have no control, except by means of the sections which are in' every Railway Construction Act. of millions. MrM c WILLIAMS The conditions are not at all similar. This is distinctly a matter between the States which are directly interested. The people of the Commonwealth have no more right to be called upon to construct a railway in Western Australia, or South Australia, than a railway in Victoria or Queensland. done some day.

I have before me a copy of a notice which has been served on residents of Williamstown, stating that artillery practice will take place at Fort Gellibrand between the hours of 3 p.m and 6 p.m. on certain dates. A previous occupant of the office of Minister of Defence visited Williamstown, and was impressed by the very great destruction of property caused by the firing of the guns in the fort. Some attempt was made to meet the difficulty by regulating 'the character of the firing, but I would urge the Minister to take action to deal with the evil. Houses and their contents are being destroyed, owing to the vibration caused by the discharge of the guns. It is a very serious matter to property-owners in the neighbourhood, many of whom are poor persons, and I trjist that the Minister will do what he can to minimize the trouble.
