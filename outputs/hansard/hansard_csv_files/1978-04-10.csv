What happened when Dr CASSI am pleased to hear the Minister a particular type of program became popular? I admit that he read the report very carefully.

The Minister makes mention of that that way. The point I want to make is that it is an again later in his speech. He points out again that impossible task. the commercial sector necessarily has to cater for largely undifferentiated audience blocs via mass So when the ABC provides a particular type of appeal programming because the commercial program which appeals to those on one side of stations are out to make money. They are out to the spectrum, and that includes a relatively few make money by increasing their advertising people in the total community, complaints are revenue; they are increasing their advertising heard to the effect that reaUy no one is very revenue by having bigger audiences. So they interested in the ABC. It is said: 'Look, it has tend to appeal to the lowest common denomisuch a low audience rating. Why do we spend so nator in order to get the largest audience possmuch money on it?' That is in direct conflict with ible. Ironically the national service is left to cater the case of the ABC successfully providing a for the rest. Of course, it could not do just that, program for a mass audience. Then what we and the Minister puts the paradox very clearly hear is this: 'Whoa, that is not where the ABC when he says: ought to be'. Of course, the way in which to look at the ABC's minority programming is to try to The national service . . . tended to program for ascertain what is the potential audience. Say the mass audiences, albeit across a wide geographical service area, while at the same time tending to concentrate on more ABC gets an audience rating of 5 per cent for a specialised educational and cultural interests. program.
