If there is any justification at all for the position of the Government on the Treasury bench, it is the restoration of parliamentary government in a better sense than we have had it previously in this Federal Parliament. But I ask honourable members to contrast the present ignominious attitude of the Ministry in relation to the vote of the honourable member for Wilmot with the most recent observations of the Prime Minister on the subject of parliamentary government. ' They are contained in his manifesto to the electors of Australia, and I shall read themThe existence of three parties is also destrucpute among ourselves as to the meaning of tive of parliamentary government as all authorithe words, ""fiscal peace,"" this much, at ties describe it.

Not so. Therefore, that he will himself admit, when I have I say that at the very beginning of this finished, that I have at least gone a very matter the Prime Minister has swallowed long way to prove my case. I am about to his own words so recently uttered. He has ask the attention of the House to the manshown that there is not even the one justifiner in which that transformation took place. cation that was pretended for the formation The dominant party has been deposed and of his Government, and he has, in a spirit divided. One part of it has been engulfed which I think none of us envy, determined by the free-trade section. The other secto cling to office in order to escape that certion of it has, I am proud to say, pretain expulsion by the people which alone served its identity, although it is true that, was the avowed merciful consideration of standing alone, owing to its small proporthe honourable member for Wilmot for tions, it was almost absolutely helpless. But adding his name do the division list we have this consolation-whic h is fortuon the Prime Minister in this regard able to enter into an alliance honourable, reminds me of that of an individual who and I -believe powerful, and full of possome years ago, passed through our Law sibilities and advantages for the CommonCourts, and declared that he was honorwealth greater than our opponents are willably acquitted on a point of law.

Does it justify their existence ? than eve.n the most sanguine of its supporters So far from relieving their position, it only accentuates the need for an immediate reference to the people, and makes it all the more necessary for us on this side of the House to review the circumstances which, in the very brief period that has elapsed since we met as a Parliament, have brought us into our present situation. Nine or ten months ago three distinct parties were sent here to transact the legislative business of this country for three years. There was the Protectionist Party, which ""was returned to power; there was the Labour Party, the other wing of the liberal parliamentary contingent, whose members came here as our friends; and there was the Free-trade group, under the leadership of the present Prime Minister.

9,Mr Isaacs,"If the right honorablecan yet fully discern I will show why: The alliance has been entered into for a limited term, and for the present has a limited platform, but if , while the two parties forming that alliance preserve their respective identities and their own special aims, there can from time to time be something like a delimitation of a common standing ground, and the ascertainment of the extent to which mutual assistance and help can be given in the support of that common standing ground, what bounds, 1 would ask, can be set to the advantages this Commonwealth must derive from the union of the robust vigour and the dauntless enthusiasm of the Labour Party, with the deliberate, cautious, but no less progressive earnestness of the Protectionist Party? agreement in all the main essentials, in all that is chiefly contained in the single phrasea phrase that can never die, a phrase that must not be allowed even to slumber, a phrase that must .not be permitted to lose one tittle of its significance a White Australia. That is the emblem of our alliance, and when a little later on I deal more particularly with the formation and platform of the alliance, it will be seen that that too was the spirit of our compact. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Can the honourable member claim a monopoly in that respect? we find ourselves to-day has, we all admit, been' approached by a very thorny path. Difficulties began' to spring up immediately after the elections. The then Prime Minister, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, appealed to the three parties in this House to compress themselves into two. tentions, but such an appeal is always, I think, better made to the electors than to honourable members, after they are elected. Of course, we all saw the difficulties in the way of carrying out the desired end of re-forming ourselves into two parties, and almost immediately the ferment commencedI can describe it by no other words -whic h has eventuated in the present crisis. Parliament met and the Deakin Government went down on the Conciliation and Arbitration Billa Bill which seems destined to become the grave of Ministerial reputations. They went down because the Prime Minister honorably stood by his declaration that he would not, even at the risk of the resignation of office, permit the inclusion of the State servants within the scope of the Bill. Then what happened? The Labour Party, who moved the amendment upon which the Government were defeated, plainly evinced that they had no desire to displace the honourable and learned member. They demonstrated that in more l ways than one,. that they did not care whether or not the Government lived. sion they intimated plainly and directly that the amendment was moved not with a desire to displace the Government, and the hope was expressed that it would not be regarded as a vital matter. They went further. In order to divest the proposal of any party significance the amendment was moved, not by the leader of I say, further, that we are in the party, but by the honourable member for Wide Bay. But, in addition to that, it was known that the leader of the Labour Party was perfectly willing to take another course, that would not have had the effect of embarrassing the Government, if the Prime Minister could, consistently with the preservation of his honour, have seen his way clear to retain office. But I think, unfortunately for the country-the Deakin Government went out of office. Then what happened? We have heard a great dear lately about 'Socialism. Was there at the period to which I have been referring any fear expressed of any socialistic tyranny? Was it then believed that the advent of the honourable member for Bland to office would mark the beginning of a reign of revolution and confiscation ? No; and we have the best proof of that. Does any one imagine for a moment that if the honourable and learned member for Ballarat had thought He did so with the very highest inthat to be the case he would have ever advised His Excellency the Governor General to send for the honourable member for Bland to form an Administration? Does any one believe that the honourable member has not the interest of his country too much at heart to advise His Excellency to send for a revolutionary as his chief adviser? NoThere was no thought of such a thing then. The socialistic bogy that we have paraded before us to-day was not then in evidence. The socialistic scarecrow was not then dressed up as it is now. The fact was that the honourable member for Bland was sent for, and he formed a Government, and, what was more, when they came into this Chamber, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, with the full consent of the whole of the members of his party, promised that the Government should receive fair play.",13,Motion Of Wan T Of Confidence

20,Mr Isaacs,"I am reading from theThis Conference was called for the purpose of framing a free-trade programme for the whole of Australia. Amongst what was designated the ""conservative"" section, I find the names of the present Premier of New South Wales, the honourable and learned member for Parkes, and Senator Pulsford. I mention their names merely because they are representative free-traders. A committee was appointed to draw up a programme. clause 5 of which reads:That the Customs and Excise duties to be imposed by the Commonwealth be confined to intoxicants and narcotics. Clause6 is as follows:The Free-trade Party will advocate that any deficiency in Federal accounts, clue to compliance with clause 8 of the Commonwealth Bill (Braddon clause) be made good by -pro rata contributions from each State, so as to avoid the imposition of direct taxation by the Federal Government, and consequent double expense of collection. That meant, I apprehend, that the onlyrevenue to be raised through the Customs was to be collected upon intoxicants and narcotics, and that all the rest of it should be obtained as the result of direct taxation by the States. That was the proposal -practicall y the single tax. When that proposal was put to the Conference, it was not carried. clauses 5 and 6, and carried in lieu thereof the following resolution:That while the Conference affirms its ultimate -bject to be the abolition of all duties except those imposed on narcotics and stimulants, yet, under the circumstances existing in most of the federated States, it will support all candidates who pledge themselves to keep the Federal Tariff as low as possible, while opposing all duties giving protection. a and b clauses? marks, the honourable member will learn something of the a, b, c, of his position. of that Conference who are in this party today. from the rather lengthy and somewhat confusing report contained in this newspaper, a compromise was eventually adopted, .but the following clause, I understand, still find's a place in the free-trade programme: That the Federal Tariff should, as far as the exigencies of the several States will permit, embrace a number of duties somewhat similar to those in Great Britain, with the intention of, as soon as possible, establishing a free breakfast table, any deficiency of revenue in such latter case to be made up by direct taxation. programme of the Free-trade Party, nor has it been during my leadership, which extends over a period of four years. The absolute contrary is the case. enough. followers still preach it. It drew up a programme, from a copy of the Constitution of the Free-trade and Liberal Association of Victoria, which was obtained only a few days ago. I particularly desire to direct attention to two clauses, which are taken from its objects and platform. They are numbered 4 and 5 respectively. No. 4 readsThat Customs and Excise duties, imposed by the Commonwealth, should be imposed only with the view to provide for the wants of the Treasury, and in no way to give support to any special industry at the expense of the general community. How, then, can the party be consistent in promising assistance to the farmers and others ? 5. That the Federal Tariff should, as far as the exigencies of the several States will permit, embrace a number of duties somewhat similar to those in Great Britain, with the intention of, as soon as possible, establishing a free breakfast The delegates struck out table, any deficiency of revenue in such latter case to be made up by direct taxation. And yet the right honourable gentleman stated a few moments ago that it was not in any platform of the Free-trade Party. Party. right honourable gentleman calls his supporters; but I do know that this was portion of the avowed platform of the president of one of the local free-trade associations in my constituency. He published it in the newspapers and it stands there to this day. This is the platform of the men who would oppose me to-morrow if the Prime Minister's threatened opposition tc me came, and who elect the members who support him. I desire to say to my honourable friends, the protectionist members of the Ministry, that this is the position in which they find themselves. They are supported by a party, the majority of whom were distinctly pledged to direct taxation as soon as they could secure it.

The stage laugh, led by the Prime Minister, that we have just heard is charming; it is the only thing in which the Government supporters are in unison. honourable member be fair in dealing with facts ? I have ever heard. refer to the position occupiedby the Watson Government. When that Government took office no one suggested that they were confiscators. which has since been raised for special purposes. The Watson Government, who took office with a promise of a fair trial, soon met their fate upon the Dark Continent of the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill ; but did they f a l l in a fair fight ? the explanations and excuses we have heard from the other side, it was not a fair fight in which the Watson Government fell. With one reservation, I would admit that it was a fair contest. If my honourable friends opposite are willing to acknowledge that they intended to turn out the Watson Government irrespective of its merits; that they intended to turn it out irrespective of the merits of the McCay amendment, or any modification ofit-that they intended to defeat the Government, regardless of the loss of time necessarily attendant upon a 1 second change of administration in so short a period, and quite irrespective of the disarrangement of public business-then , I am fiee to admit on that condition, and that condition only, that it was a fair fight. But from the moment that the pre-arranged surprise of the honourable and learned member, for Corinella was sprung upon the Watson Government and this House, no one was so. blind as not to see that the intention was to insult the Ministry, to take the busiI t is easy enough to ness of the country out of its hand's, and to prevent it from carrying the Bill into The single-taxers went round the Committee. It was further intended by some of my honourable friends opposite, that the position of parties in this* House should Having disposed, fairly be definitely and materially altered. From that moment, the change took place which has resulted in our present situation. It oh ! has been said that the vote which resulted in the defeat of the Watson Government was in reality a noble stand taken up by honourable members opposite, in the interests of the non-unionist workers'. Can any reasonable being believe that that was' so? Some honourable members opposite have the made that assertion, and I should like to place them, together with the honourable member for Bland and numbers of other honourable members on this side of the House, on a public platform before a mass meeting of the non-unionist workers of Australia and to call upon that meeting I am just putting in a word. to say, ""Who are your friends."" I think that there would be but one response. Honourable members opposite take refuge in the word ""preference""; but there is really no refuge in it. If they were to approach the That is merely a party cry non-unionists of this country, and to say to them, ""Our fight was in order that you should have equal rights with the unionist workers of Australia,"" how would they prove their case? They would have to admit that under the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill non-unionists are not placed on as good a footing, independently of preference, as are unionists; that, for the sake of employers, more than for the sake of unions, non-unionists, whilst penalized and made subject to the liabilities of the B ill , are not given rights as non-unionists. A non-unionist who strikes in combination with other non-unionists may be fined, and, if need be, ultimately imprisoned; but if he went to my honourable friends, who pose as his champions, and inquired, "" Well, if I , as a man, am brought under the penal provisions of this B ill , do I , as a man, obtain a corresponding remedy?"" they would have to reply, "" No, -for the sake of the employers chiefly we refuse to allow you as a man to go into Court to redress your grievances.""

The great object was to give employers a hold on the funds and moneys of the unions. While that is so, how can my honourable friends turn round and say that we should put all men on an equal footing, when they would not dare to do it? I say that, even in the interests of the employers, they would not dare to do it. do it, they have been false to the matter, because they have not ventured to do it. If they know what it is right to do, and then do not do what is' right, they are doubly to blame. M i . ' DUGALD THOMSON -We proposed it. with honourable members opposite are made very evident by their interruptions. I propose to consider now what the result would be if there were no preference in the Bill. One of my honourable friends opposite, and I think it was the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, suggested that there should be 'no preference in the B ill , and I think he instanced the case of the Victorian Factories Act. was not necessarily the essence of arbitration. my honourable and learned friend's argument further than he intended. I think that what he contended was that, as this provision was not found necessary under the Victorian Factories Act, it could not be considered to be necessary in a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. But the distinction between the two is evident. Under the Victorian Factories Act a decision come to is practically a common rule, and a common not rule that does not require any preferenceat least, it does not require it nearly so much as it would be required in connection with a decision under the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. It is. in order to relieve the Court of the necessity of doing a considerable amount of hardship to employI showed how ers by insisting on a common rule that an alternative power is given to award a preference in certain cases. It seems to me that my honourable and learned friend must acknowledge, when 'he comes to consider the matter more carefully, that the analogy which he suggested is altogether wanting. But why is a preference necessary? Why is the Court necessarily armed with a power personal liberty, js to ' give a preference in proper and just cases ? Because since unions,, and unions alone, can bring their cases before the Court -unles s in exceptional cases where the registrar chooses to make a special certificate, and we need not take them into consideration-if an award is made, that award may, to say the very least of it, be confined in its benefits to the members of the union. If we can imagine that the Court makes an award ordering that a particular organization of employers shall pay a particular organization of employees certain wages, give them certain hours of labour, and certain rights; what would be the result? The plain and almost immediate result would be that the employers, in order to get outside that award would take, care that the next men they employed were not unionists, but non-unionists. der the same conditions. is not clear, and the award may not provide it, and then when they employed these",17,Honourable Members O H

58,Mr Isaacs,"Perhaps not. The Billnon-unionists, although they are. forbidden to dismiss any employee merely because he is under an award, a few months or a few weeks perhaps would see the absence of many of the men who had struggled and fought to gain the rights conferred by the award. This might be continued for a very long period of time, and the ultimate result might be that the very men who had fought for the rights of workers would be the only men who had lost them, and the whole trouble might have to be gone over again. Therefore, I say preference is necessary. When we come to discuss the vital question whether the honourable and learned member for Corinella proposed an amendment that is beneficial or detrimental in the interests of the Bill, I have no hesitation in saying that the honourable and learned gentleman's amendment is absolutely fatal to the whole measure. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat is reported to have said that the difference between the two was as fine as a razor's edge. To mv mind the difference is vital, and I shall endeavour to show it. In the Bill as it stands, in the first place, preference must be understood to be only the right of a unionist to priority, "" all other things being equal."" If two men present themselves for employment, one a unionist and the other a non-unionist, the (unionist, if inferior in experience,. competency, or for any other valid reason, has no right of preference. that ? that. It contains the qualification "" all man, and get a reply from each? It would other things being equal."" masters or the trade unionists? under this Bill? Then any union that I say that to enable an organization to has any political object cannot claim precomply with that provision, unless some .exference. I think that there is also a protraordinary meaning is given to it by the vision inserted, at the instance, I believe, Court, would be absolutely impossible, and of the honourable and learned member for I say that the B ill , so far as preference, Bendigo, that ample notice shall be given and, through that, so far as prevention of when any application for preference is evasion is concerned, is a legislative corpse. . made, so that all persons and organizations I wish to show how different that prowho may desire to oppose the application posal was from the proposition of the honmay come in and be heard. One would orable member for Bland, which ran in have thought that these safeguards would this waybe considered ample . 1 Then came the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, and it proshall be given to the members of an organizavidesThat no such preference shall be directed to be given unless the applicationHonorable members.will notice the words usedthe application for such preference is, in the opinion of the Court, approved by a majority of those affected by the award who have interests in common with the applicants.

It means that a premature dissolution would not release honourable members. came about they would still be bound by the forfeiture of their liberty of action, and they dare not go to their constituents and say, "" We ask you to give relief to these industries.""

Now, what becomes of the taunts levelled at the Labour Party, who are sought to be covered by the odium of having forfeited only their own rights, which they were frank enough to place in the hands of their own constituents? In this compacl there is a plain written invitation to honourable members to say that they will not even ask their constituents to do right and justice should necessity arise. Mr G. B .

81,What Mr Isaacs,"Having made that agreethem. able, or ashamed to give us that information, they must accept responsibility for their action. tion, I should like to refer to the alliance programme. somebody did so. trast that programme with the coalition agreement to form a just estimate of the position which we occupy, and the work we have so far accomplished. When my honourable friends opposite affect to sneer at the alliance, I do not think for an instant that their gaiety is real. the forced laughter that a few minutes ago, it is not sincere. I believe that they see a great deal more in that alliance which they are anxious about for their own sakes than they acknowledge. I wish to say at this juncture-becaus e misrepresentations have been made in regard to it-that I have the utmost faith in the loyalty and honour of the Labour Party. I believe that they will honorably abide by that agreement. From first to last, with the exception of the open statements that we have heard-and which, I think, came from one quarter only-ther e has never been the slightest suggestion that the Labour Partywish to break away from it. The statements which appeared in the public press the other day are without any justification whatever. It is quite true-as some of my honourable friends have said-that the alliance has not been universally approved. But it has not been far short of it. I should like to ask, "" When was there a step of similar magnitude and importance consummated so swiftly, or one which attracted to itself such a large measure of public approbation?"" When we regard the matter in that way, it is astonishing-no t that we should have failed to secure universal approbation-bu t that our agreement should have been so speedily and largely approved. What was its justification ? I will tell honourable members. We found ourselves suddenly faced by a common foe. We regretted-and we still regret-the absence of our friends, but we hope and believe that their absence is only ""temporary. We found in the fires of sudden adversity sufficient light benefit of all the States. to see, and sufficient heat to weld together, certain political points of contact, which demonstrate to me-and I think to the whole of Australia-that upon some of the chief ideals of liberal policy there is a substantial agreement between our two parties. If my honourable friends are unWhen we found that to be the case, our discussions were conducted, not like those which have evidently taken place between In contrast to their posihonorable members, upon the other side of the House, in secret, but in the open light of day, as far as such discussions could possibly be so conducted. The public have seen the result of our deliberations. They have.followed them from first to last. I claim that we have reason to be proud, not only of the manner in which we came together, but of the results of our negotiations,, as they appear in the formal document which the country now has in its possession. Honourable members Like have chosen to criticise the alliance agreewe heard ment, I will not say severely, but without due regard to a. consideration of its terms. That agreement is as follows: 1. Each party to retain its separate identity.. 2. Alliance to be for the life of this and next Parliament. 3. Each party to use its influence, individually and collectively, with its organizations and supporters to secure support for and immunity from opposition to members of the other party during the currency of the alliance. 4. A joint election committee to consider contested seats, and make recommendations to both parties. 5. Any Member of Parliament who agrees to these articles may, subject to the approval of both parties, be admitted to tliis alliance. 1.

Either party may at any time submit to either party any other subjects for consideration with a view to joint action. Let us consider the first plank in that agreement. Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and is not a proposal to conduct a funeral march behind that measure, as the Ministry have done. Instead it is a proposal that the Billshall be framed as nearly as possible in accordance with the terms' of the measure as it was originally introduced by the Deakin Government, but any honourable member is to be at liberty to adhere to the votes which he has already given. upon the other side of the House will presently begin to realize that the Labour Partv is not a mere machine, and that it does not require everybody to become members of that machine. The supporters of the Government tell us in one moment that nothing can be done except by means of the machine, and that the majority are to coerce the minority. In the next breath they sneer at the statement in the alliance programme, that its members are to be at liberty to adhere to their former votes. If they do not realize the full significance of those words, perhaps they will allow me to explain them. When our agreement sets out that members of the alliance are at liberty to adhere to the votes which they have already given, it does not mean that they are to be coerced into repeating those votes without modification. It does not mean that we could not work together, and do what we should have tried to do had the Watson Government been allowed to take the Bill into Committee for the consideration of any modifications or suggestions. learned member for Werriwa does not often grace us with his presence, and when he does I hope that he will allow me to proceed without interruption. This clause is evidence that we are anxious and willing for honourable members to have the fullest opportunity to. place their most mature views on the subject before the country. The next point in the programme is2. White Australia legislation. Maintain existing Acts in their integrity, and effectively support their intention by faithfu l administration. I wish to contrast that with the avowed intention of the Prime Minister to break down the essential portion of the White Australia policy at the first opportunity. Then, in the agreement we also find3. Navigation Bill -Report of Royal ComI t relates to the mission to be expedited, and subject to this Bill to provide for (a) The protection of Australian shipping from unfair competition. We put in the forefront of our navigation proposals the protection of Australian shipping from unfair competition. Is there any proposal corresponding to that in the Government programme? The agreement then mentions the Trade Marks Bill, the Fraudulent Marks Bill, and the High Commissioner Bill. Why has the Government dropped the High Commissioner Bill? Is it because the alliance in this clause provides that the selection of a High Commissioner shall be subject to the prior consent of Parliament ? It is very singular that until this agreement appeared in the public press, there was no suggestion from the Ministry that they were not going on with the High Commissioner Bill. Then the. agreement goes on to deal with the Electoral Bill, the Papua Bill, and anti-trust legislation. Are my friends on the other side, who assume to",23,Joint Platform

86,Mr Isaacs,"The honourable andbe the friends of the people, prepared to pass this legislation? Or do they expect, in the event of an election, to have the weight and influence and money of the trusts behind them? I wonder if that is what they are looking for. Then we come to that part of the agreement which deals with the tobacco monopoly. I do not desire to anticipate any finding of a Royal CommissionI do not wish to say anything to prejudge the matter-bu t there is sufficient ground for a very searching inquiry. And it will require a very searching inquiry to ascertain whether fhe tobacco monopolists of this country are, or are not, sweating the retail sellers. member voted for the big difference between the excise and the duty. learned member for Werriwa always says something irrelevant. The agreement then goes on to refer to the question of the Iron Bonus Bill. I do not think that the Minister of Trade and Customs quite apprehended what is meant by this paragraph, and my desire is to remove any misconception the honourable member is under. The paragraph in the agreement means that all the members of this alliance are in favour of the introduction of and passing of an Iron Bonus Bill under any circumstances. The method of control is not a political machine matter, but an individual liberty matter, and that, I think, is made evident to the country. who is right and who is wrong, at this juncture, we recognise that some honourable members believe the industry should be undertaken by the State, while others like myself believe it should be undertaken by private enterprise, subject to any proper control Parliament may think fit to impose. When honourable members reflect for a moment-honorabl e members who refer to this as a socialistic proposal-the y must see that, no matter what Bills on this subject are passed by this Parliament, we cannot force the States to start the industry. If a State does not choose, it need not fake advantage of the Bill, and cannot be compelled to do so. Therefore, it is not in the hands of this Parliament to introduce Socialism in that way. I desire to say distinctlyI do not wish any misunderstanding about the matter-that so far as I am concerned I am in favour of having the industry undertaken by private enterprise, with such supervision and necessary control as Parliament may desire to secure the interests of the people. Then we come to paragraph 12, which refers to a standing committee on trade and commerce and agriculture. I desire to say a word or two on this point, because the Minister of Trade and Customs has said that the Government sympathetically view the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. I sympathetically viewed that proposal three years ago, and then, as I have recently, gave the honourable and learned member my strongest support, as did also the honourable member for Gippsland. I should be very glad to see the proposal then made adopted; but I say that the question, when it was presented to the last Government, was regarded by them as involving great expense. While still supporting the proposal for an agricultural appropriation, I find in Canada a most beneficent system, under which there is a standing committee, consisting of members of Parliament. That committee has rendered the greatest possible service to Canada, not only in furthering the interests of agriculture, but in developing immigration, commerce, and trade generally. Why should we not have, without any expense to the country, a committee composed of members of this Chamber, who would be only too willing and anxious to further such a work? We should then have a body which would be of the greatest assistance to the Government, to the producers, and to the commercial world generally. UnWithout discussing less the Ministry have determined not to adopt anything but what is suggested by one of their supporters, why do they set their faces against something which has proved to be beneficent and inexpensive, and which would help us from time to time in any inquiry we desired to make regarding, the Tariff, agriculture, commerce, and immigration in all its phases and forms ? We now come to that part of the agreement which provides13. Preferential trade to be discussed by the joint parties at an early date. On that point, however, I shall reserve what I have to say until a later stage, when I am dealing with the proposals of the Government. The next clause is one which has excited varied degrees of attention from my friends opposite14. Legislation (including Tariff legislation) shown to be necessary1. To develop Australian resources; 2.

There was a little stuffing, but it was taken out by paragraphs a and b. said that we had given everything away, and he now declares that there is nothing in the programme. or low duties? That is what the country desires to know. ness of the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, but I wish that he would not concentrate all his energies into a few moments. We protectionists set great store by the clause in our programme with regard to legislation, including Tariff legislation, and I feel that a great work has been done for this country in embodying it in the alliance programme. We protectionists-or , at all events, those of us who have maintained our position as protectionists-fee l that protection cannot be eliminated from a truly Liberal programme. We hold that protection to labour implies complete protection against unfair conditions. Whatever those conditions may be, and whenever they arise, although they may spring from any distance, if they reach and affect the worker, he ought to be relieved from them. If a man be attacked by disease, it is immaterial to him whether it has sprung up alongside him at his work or has reached him from thousands of miles away; if it infects him, his peril is the same in either case, and I would ask whether we are to stop when we have protected the workers of this country by means of Conciliation and Arbitration Acts and other measures, and to leave the gates of the Customs House open in order that they may be injured by the goods that enter through those gates? Is not Milton's great question entirely apposite ;o the present situationWhat boots it at one gate to make defence, And at another to let in the foe? I hold that it is impossible to maintain Conciliation and Arbitration Acts or Factory Acts in their integrity if goods, which the Prime Minister admits are the products of underpaid and sweated labour, are to enter our territory, and e'ther tame down the worker to the required degree of docility or abolish his occupation altogether. It is a part, and an essential part, of our policy that we shall not, either by the personal contiguity of the sweated labourer or by the unrestricted admission bf his sweated goods, leave the workers on our soil to the wild mercy of unreasoning competition-competitio n that knows no point at which to stop in the process of paring down wages save that at which the human machine is just able to subsist and move. No part of the Ballarat speech delivered by the then Prime Minister, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, aroused more enthusiasm than that which related to his programme for a White Australia. I should like to read it to the House, because it is essential to understand the attitude in which my honourable friends opposite find themselves todayYou probably believe that a White Australia is secure. I hope it is, but it will not be secure unless a vigilant watch is kept upon proposals to tamper with it. None of a serious character has been put forward by anybody in a responsible position, but there are indications that we may have to defend the principle yet. So far as this Government is concerned, it will be ready for the emergency. (Cheers.) A White Australia does not by any means mean only the preservation of the complexion of the people of this country. It means the multiplying of their homes, so that we may be able to occupy, usu, and defend every part of our continent; it means the maintenance of conditions of life fit for white men and white women; it means equal laws and opportunities for a l l ; it means protection against the underpaidlabour of other lands. It means social justice, so far as we can establish it, including just trading and the payment of fair wages. (Cheers.) A White Australia means a civilization whose foundations are built upon healthy lines, lived in honest toil, under circumstances which imply no degradation. Fiscally, a White Australia means protection. We protect ourselves against armed aggression, why not against aggression by commercial means? We protect ourselves against undesirable aliens, why not against the products of undesirable alien labour? (Cheers.) A White Australia is not a surface, but it is a reasoned policy which goes down to the roots of national life, 'and by which the whole of our social, industrial, and political organization is governed. I have listened to and have read many speeches by the honourable and . learned member for Ballarat, but I confess that nothing I have ever heard from the honourable and learned gentleman has surpassed, for solid truth and glowing eloquence, the passage I have just read. What is the position of the present Governmentin relation to it? For this is the keystone of our liberal policy. We have been told that there is a fiscal truce. Is there a White Australia truce? No. Indeed, the declaration of intention we have had from the present Prime Minister is that he is seeking to secure a majority to repeal an essential part of that White Australia policy.",26,Honourable Members Hear Hear

The words of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat were, that a White Australia is not a matter of colour only, but of the conAttorney-General to put in force the Antiditions under which white men and white women ought to live. It stands for civilization and fair wages, and will the Minister of Defence tell me that he does not regard it as an essential part of the White Australia policy that we should not be inundated with labourers imported like chattels for any length of time, at any rate of wages ? I say that that is an essential part during the past few years, the country has atof the White Australia policy, and if that one gate is to be taken off its hinges, and cast down, then gedd-bye to our White Australia. essential part of Australian policy not to import labourers like chattels, but it is an abuse of terms to say that that is contrary to the White Australia policy. fence apply his phrase, "" an abuse of terms,"" to his late leader. a passage from the speech of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat with which I thought we all agreed, and I now say that if the Minister is going to part company with the honourable and learned member for Ballarat on that vital subject, the sooner we know it the better. fair. lawyer's term. 'these ebullitions on the part of my honourable friends opposite. are just beginning to awaken to a sense of their position. They are just beginning to understand to what their policy leads them, and I intend to bring it yet more fully home to them. The words of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, in the speech to which I have referred, received remarkable corroboration a very few weeks ago from President Roosevelt. I wish to read to honourable members a few of the President's words on the memorable occasion when he received a notification at Sagamore Hill of his re-nomination for the Presidency of the ""United States. is receiving the support of the trusts, if honourable members like. wrong again, because the trusts are all against President Roosevelt. man in America who is more relentlessly pursued by the trusts than is President Roosevelt, the man who commanded his Trust Law, and succeeded in doing what we hope to be able to do-to insure, so far as legislation and administration is concerned, that we shall have no monopolistic trusts in this country. President Roosevelt said, with regard to Tariff re-adjustmentWe have enacted a Tariff law, under which, tained a height of material well-being never before reached. Wages are higher than ever before. That whenever the need arises there should be a re-adjustment of Tariff schedules is undoubted. This has a remarkable application to our present conditions. But such changes can, with safety, be made only by those whose devotion to the principle of a protective Tariff is beyond question. My honourable friends on the other side would have us believe that they are willing I have read to have a Commission appointed, and that they are willing to re-adjust the Tariff. Can we trust them ? President Roosevelt addsFor, otherwise, the changes would amount, not to re-adjustment, but to repeal. The re-adjustment when made must maintain and not destroy the protective principle.' To the farmer, the merchant, the manufacturer, this is vital. But, perhaps, no man is so much interested as the wage-worker in the maintenance of our present economic system, both as regards the finances and the Tariff. The standard of living of our wage-workers is higher than that of any other country, and it cannot so remain unless we have a protective Tariff which shall always keep as a minimum the rate of duty sufficient to cover the I feel that they difference between the labour cost here and abroad.

I wish to make some observations which some honourable' members may think rather strong, but which are entirely justified by the position in which we find ourselves, and I , therefore, wish to make it clear that I have no personal quarrel with fhe Prime Minister. I intend to confine my observations to the political aspect, and, perhaps, I may be permitted at this juncture to say that I join entirely with my honourable friends who preceded me in the deprecation of personalities in a debate of this nature, or, indeed, in any, debate. I think that the time is fast approaching when Parliament may be called upon to curb that which is known as parliamentary privilege, and which is sometimes used in order to suggest personal infamy, which perhaps only requires a most cursory examination to demonstrate has no foundation. privilege. Parliament may find it necessary to devise some remedy sharper and more calculated to meet the occasion than the mere disapprobation or even contempt of honourable members. into no personal quarrel with my right honorable friend; indeed, I do not disguise my admiration for his capacity and powers of leadership. Opposing him as we doand as long as he retains his present political mode of thought, I always shallnone of us can deny his great capacity for, at all events, persuasion, an ability to seize and make the most of all opportunities, and a curious power of attracting to his side and enlisting in his support men who, up to that moment, were thought to be his avowed and constant opponents. learned member is going to lodge some shots at him after that. fectly clear that my quarrel with the right honourable gentleman is a purely political one. that he holds views which we, I think, as a united Opposition, must regard as fundamentally unsound, and as absolutely fatal to national progress. which he as Prime Minister must of necessity impress upon the Government, and which, quite apart from any question of fiscal truce, touch so vitally on the general directive spirit of policy, that our acceptance of him as a leader is absolutely impossible. In order that we may judge of this, let us look round at this Continent, and ask ourThis is selves what do we intend Australia to be? What will those who come after us demand of our memories ? Is Australia to be known for its square miles of desolation, or is it to be known as a hive of industry ? Aie we to cultivate only t'he primary industries, knowing that they are subject to all the disadvantages which the varying seasons and other elements of chance must bring to a limited sphere of national operations, and to the expense and risk of complete dependence on foreign markets? Or are we to set about planting a busy population upon the land, both primary and secondary producers, one set winning the wealth above and below the soil, and the other set fashioning that wealth in every conceivable way into all the requirements of civilized man ? Are we not to start out and do our best to promote the diversification of employment and increase of population, to help the primary producers, not merely by encouraging production but by creating a home In curbing that market-by giving them a better, quicker, safer, and cheaper outlet for their productions-and at the same time not to forget the secondary producers, affording them all the advantages of the material, the fuel, and I enter the mineral which nature has bountifullv placed within our reach, and which we ha\rs only to stretch out our hands to win ? That. I take it, is the ideal for Australia. Where we join issue with the Prime Minister is in this: He holds that, in spite of our sources of natural wealth, in spite of all our wool, tallow, hides, coal, and iron, Australia can never hope to be a great manufacturing country until-when ? Until stress of competition has so lowered our wage rate as to bring it down, to the level of the pauper rate in other lands. which the right honourable gentleman has told before, and which I shall not cease to bring before the country until it is placed in the fullest possession of Australia. This is the cardinal feature of his faith. It is not his The reason why I oppose him is desire, but is his belief. He thinks that under free-trade what I have just said must be the iron rule which governs our industries. He thinks, too, that protection will not They are views better affairs; in fact, he opposes protection, because he says the acceleration of these industries only hastens the introduction of the evils which he declares are attendant upon them. free-trade members of the Labour Party cheer that?.",28,Honourable Members Hear Hear

118,Mr Joseph Cook,"Why do not thejuncture to prove what I have said as to the right honourable gentleman's policy. I referred to it before, and I am' going to refer to it again. It has received no contradiction from him as a policy; it can receive no explanation or, I think, extenuation. In his speech on the 31st October, 1901, reported on page 6800 of Hansard, he alluded to the proposal of the then Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, and the then Treasurer, Sir George Turner, to establish a woollen industry. If there is any industry in this community which could be established on a national basis is it not a woollen industry ? Andi f we cannot establish that industry what can we establish with advantage? gentleman sneered at the proposal. saidIt is a kind of policy that only a tyro in mering said so much, he goes on to saycantile knowledge would venture to propound. . . . We all hope that Australia will have a great woollen industry, but that will have to come when we are not so well off. Of course, it is not his desire, but it is his belief that a time is coming when Australia will not be so well off. Is it not our duty to -prevent that state of things from occuiring? Is it not our mission to make He further says that he did not refer to Australia better off, not worse off? Then all our industries. he saysWhat is the hope of the great manufactures of Australia? How are we to manufacture cheaply or to compete with the cheap labour of other 1 countries ? And he goes on to show that we cannot have better machines, we cannot have better factories referring to British and German factories-and he says that the manufacturers of England and Germany can buy their raw material all over the world. Then he says this, and I commend it to my honourable friends who point out how much free trade has done for EnglandHow are"" we going to compete with these underbut, as far as manufacturers are conpaid, sweated countries until our own labour is under-paid and sweated too ? country, Germany, that he referred to. many, but he admitted that labour is sweated and underpaid in England also. He saysThere is no magic about production. It seems to me that the prospect of growing these noxious weeds of sweated industries, The woollen industry is, I suppose, a noxious weedon this bright continent should cause a man associated with the interests of labour to shudder. Then he says-and these lines are what I regard as the fundamental root of his anticipations of Australian manufacturing eminenceI n the plenitude of time, when our millions become tens of millions, we shall have a crop of misery which will solve the difficulty in regard to cheap manufactures. Sir, I should like to ask more, but I should like to ask at this point -is it to be a crop of misery only that is going to solve the problem of our cheap manufactures? Are we not prepared to take some stand more worthy of men who have charge of a great continent like this? Surely, sir, that is a pessimistic doctrine The right honourable that any man ought to fly from rather than He acknowledge, bow. down to, and yield to in the way the Prime Minister does. HavW ill the erection of a fence solve it? Never. We may run a ring round our own people, but we cannot bull-dose the markets of the world. When we come to compete with those markets, we shall have to do as all other nations do. That is why I have abhorred the policy of producing artificial industries, which belong to a period of human misery and over population. I am not alluding to a large number of Australian industries, which are bound to come soon and be a source of prosperity to us. the honourable and learned member read that passage, from the way in which he read the other 1 quence and sweetness of tone of the honourable member for Parramatta, nothing could take away from the force of the words themselves. The Prime Minister says, "" As far as some natural industries are concerned, we can hope to do some good, cerned, there is only one thing that I can see in the future, and that is cheap labour."" Che'ap labour, sir, never made a strong nation. Therefore, it is just this deadly policy that I oppose. Are we to accept as an ultimate fact in Australian economics, that our labour is doomed to pauperization? Is it to be regarded as our inescapable fate that until that moment of degradation comes Australia can never hope to attain any eminence as a manufacturing country ?

Unless we are determined, as, I believe, we are, to develop our industries, and unless we are prepared in developing them, at the same time to maintain and to raise the standard of life of those working in the ranks, unless we are prepared to raise and advance the cause of the workers in Australia-the n I say without hesitation that -all this vast array of splentime, if it is the necessities of the States did Federal paraphernalia from the Governor General down to the humblest worker in the executive service of the country, is a hollow and a costly sham. And although it must be far from the personal desire of the Prime Minister, or of any honourable member who supports him. that this should be the result, yet,I say without hesitation that such a deplorable eventuality is so necessarily the result of his creed, that his installation as the head of the Government of Australia is a direct violation of the best interests of this country. beliefs of the Prime Minister to the officially declared programme of the Government, what do we find? The Minister of Trade and Customs objected the other night to the expression ""sexless."" as applied to the Government. Well, of course, that term was applied to their policy.

What is there in their programme that can arouse any hope or any enlightenment or cheerfulness in Australia ? Take awav the non-contentious matters, take away those that are common to us all, and what have we? Do they wish to tell us that their union did bring forth some promising infants ? If so. they have been strangled in the Cabinet before they, reached the light of day. We have seen one poor child emerge from the Cabinet bruised, battered, and mutilated almost beyond recognition-preferentia l trade; and one they have decently buried, as they think, the Arbitration Bill. They have gone as far as they could go with the Transcontinental Railway survey; but what other great questions have they dealt with? Pensions, and I wish also to refer to the WhereI subject, in order to say this-that I dissent from the Government proposal, because it seems to me that they have endeavoured to shelve the question. What did they say? Thev are going to do something only in cooperation with the States. I liave a double thing to say about that. First of. all, I do not agree with the Minister of Defence, when he said there was no possibility of doing anything in this matter federally without direct taxation. We know perfectly well that the difficulty standing in the way of such a national old-age pension law, as we should like as a Federal Parliament to impose, prevents us at the present moment from giving all we wish. But, at the same that are preventing us from doing that, how much further advanced shall we be from consultation with those States? Are the States which are unable to surrender any portion of their three-fourths at the present time more likely to be able to do it after consultation ? that it was the limitations of the Constitution which prevented us from appropriating more than one-fourth of the receipts from the Tariff. Passing away from the fatalistic from consultation with the States? The Minister does not explain that. up more. Victoria and New South Wales, which do not miss it, or the impecunious States? What does the honourable and learned member mean? Does he mean that the States which are less able to bear the strain of extra taxation, which are, in fact, short of cash for this purpose, will say to the Federal Government, "" We are ready to give up part of our three-fourths."" them something in return. them in return? Has any proposal been made? This is perhaps a new piece of patchwork on the Government proposal, a suggestion that has never before 'been made, and one ejaculated now, I think, only to cover a retreat. Of course, we cannot go into details on the matter at the present time, and I do not wish to do so; but it is within the competence of the Federal Government to do a great deal in the way of establishing They have referred to Old-Age some tentative old-age pensions law without imposing one penny of further taxation.",30,Honourable Members Hear Hear

I ' do not agree with him in thatThe experience of the States will then have taught the Commonwealth what to provide and what to avoid. I agree with the honourable and learned gentleman to this extent, that we cannot at present go so far as we should like to go to put the whole thing on a complete basis. put it on a basis which would enable old men and old women who have to go from one part of the Commonwealth to another, to be sure of something as Australian citizens, notwithstanding their movement from State to State, and it would enable us to get much more valuable experience of the operation of a Federal OldAge Pensions Act. WhereI do agree with the honourable and learned gentleman is in this statement' Such a B i ll will impose no new expenditure upon the people, but will simply transfer the State expenditure to one Federal system. the two chief States of the Union is to the contrary. Their charity expenditure has not decreased since the passing of Old-Age Pensions Acts. ter for the States themselves. I do not wish to control the States in this matter; but if we pass a Federal old-age pension law, the States will have it within their power to discontinue, pro tanto, their internal expenditure on pensions or other relief, and, therefore, no direct taxation will be required, nor need there be any further expense of any kind. differential old-age pensions? that the Federal Government ought to consider for itself how far it can provide a tentative uniform old-age pensions system within the terms of the Constitution, one not involving, any additional taxation. If the Federal Government is not able to go to the full extent of some of the States, those States can continue to provide the difference between the amount now provided by them and that provided by the They could Federal law, and can save the latter The honourable and learned amount. I do not wish to repeat what I have said, but I do not see why the Federal Government need act in co-operation with the States in this matter, and I wish to make some general observations on this portion of the policy of the present Government, because, if I understand it aright, it involves a great breach of the constitutional powers of the Federal Parliament. If we introduce an innovation into our Federal Government of the nature that is presaged by the policy of this Administration, we shall make a terrible mistake. We know perfectly well that the Prime Minister was one of the sturdiest fighters in the Convention for the representation of the But we could people only. He was to a large extent adverse to the creation of a States' House, or, at all events, desired a general referendum. In any case, the Constitution today provides in the Senate the proper means of guarding State rights and State interests. If we are going to give way to the Governments of the States, which are responsible to totally different Legislatures, elected on a basis in many cases not the same as ours, we shall introduce a very dangerous principle.

Are we to say that, in addition to the responsibility of the Federal Government to this Chamber, and in another sense to the Senate, it must be responsible to the Legislatures of the various States as represented by their respective Governments? If we did so, we should introduce a great many serious clogs into the Federal machinery. Surely it is by the Senate, which is elected by the people of Australia, the smallest State having the same voice as the largest, that State interests and State rights are to be safeguarded. While I agree that we should, so far as national interests will admit, work in the most complete harmony with the States, we are not to subordinate the Federal action and national interest to the consideration whether the States Governments are prepared to concur. is unnecessary. With regard to the only other question of any importance upon which the Ministryhave vouchsafed any information, preferential trade, it is a great question from whatever stand-point we regard it. It is great from the stand-point of those who oppose it, and still greater from the stand-point of those who favour it. What a melancholy spectacle the Government present in regard to this question! The alliance, we are told, with some derision, proposes to consider it. The Government have considered it, and the conclusion to which they have come is, to put it shortly, in relation to that subject, to erect a tombstone upon the grave Of responsible government. The situation was very indefinite-quit e indefinite enoughwhen the Prime Minister announced his policy; it became ridiculous when the Minister of Trade and Customs added his quota, and when, in this debate, the Prime Minister concluded his statement of the Government position, the coping-stone of absurdity was placed upon it. tion, according to the Government? First of all. the Government will fake up the subject: secondly, they will only do that if England asks for it. In other words, they are prepared to say, ""Yes, Mr profit that attach to us. I say that Chamberlain."" Next, England is not likely to ask, and next, therefore, the Government are not likely to take it up. the Government should by chance take up the question, they are absolutely resolvedto let each man go his own way. This is a strange commentary upon the criticism of the alliance. Upon that question, which, above all others, demands that corporate responsibility and a definite attitude should be taken on belialf of the people of Australia, the Government are hopelessly split up. Some of the members may support it, some of them may oppose it. Those who support it may advocate a reduction of duties, whilst others support an addition to duties. What a ridiculous spectacle is thus presented to the people of this country ! as that presented by the alliance upon that point. the Prime Minister on this matter was that if the proposals clashed with his fiscal opinions, only one thing could happen, meaning that he would resign his position. I would ask whether that declaration does not sufficiently inform my protectionist friends in the Government, or, at all events, their protectionist supporters, that as long as the Prime Minister holds the reins of Government preferential trade is lost, because so long as the Government are allowed to sit on the Treasury benches, unable, as the Prime Minister has admitted, to speak in the name of Australia, so long will the people and public opinion of England be seriously influenced _ in the direction of believing that Australia is adverse to the proposal. Cannot the Government see that 'the pathway of preferential trade is the high-road to the greatest alliance into which we can ever hope to enter ? Foreign alliances are important, but even the friendly ties that stretch across to the great Republic of the West are only secondary in importance to the closer and firmer bonds that ought to unite firmly and inseparably all the white peoples of this Empire. The Empire, as we know it to-day, is new, but silently and unconsciously, though none the less surely and permanently, there has been growing up, all over the globe where the flag flies, an intense desire for What is the posicloser inter-Imperial communication, for some tangible and material recognition of the sense of preservation, and of the sentiment of patriotism, and even of the more sordid considerations of the Prime Minister is blind to these things, and I cannot understand his Further, if blindness.

I shall finish my course this evening with the same vigour and effectiveness that have characterized my honourable and learned friend. I am one of those who are bold enough not even to regret the admittedly inordinate length of this debate, because, although I would willingly forget many features of it-and doubtless all of us would do so-it has taken place at a period when a review of the general position in which Parliament finds itself, and of its various parties in relation to each other, may be for our own benefit, and, at the That same time, add to the information of the public. For a long time the waters of political lif e have been turbid. They are not yet It was by any means clear. Among the opportunities whicn are afforded to us to precipitate at least some of the solution which at present causes the turfridity, a discussion of He refused to this character has its definite value. For my own part, I hope to view the questions before us with that end in view, speaking from no merely partisan stand-point, avoiding every personal reflection and every partu consideration that can be dispensed with under the circumstances. The speakers who have preceded me have, on several occasions, alluded to the circumstances under which this Parliament commenced, realizing that from that starting point even the briefest retrospect must necessarily AlthoughI have begin. If we ignore the events of the past, we cannot well interpret or justly weigh the circumstances immediately under review. Ever since the commencement of this Parliament we have been slowly threading a labyrinth in order to discover the high road which, for the benefit of this country, we can most advisedly travel. It needed no gif t of prophecy, even at the very outset, to foresee that the course before us would not be an easy one! In fact, before the results of the elections were announced-o n the evening prior to polling day-speakin g in the neighbourhood of Melbourne, I ventured to say, as the head of For our part, we shall welcome the then Government, that I viewed the situWe are prepared to face ation with the gravest concern..

I feared that we should have a Parliament composed of discordant elements and containing no strong party. I made that statement prior to polling day. I venture to say to any careful student of the electoral returns for this Parliament, that in them the whole of its history lay capsulate. After polling-day, we saw a sum set for us, which we were left to work out, but which could be worked out only to",33,Honourable Members Hear Hear
146,Mr Deakin (Ballarat),"I hope thatone answer. There were different ways in which it could be dealt with; but the result as it appeared to me then, and as it appears to me now, must necessarily be the same. What did we find ? We found three parties, not merely artificial accretions, but separated by adhesion to three separate dominating principles. Upon our side, we sought fiscal peace and preferential trade; upon that of the then direct Opposition, fiscal war for a revenue Tariff; and .upon that of the labour candidates the programme of their party. We found these three parties embodying these three principles, returned in practically equal strength. It is true, that other issues, and great ones, were submitted to the country. They overlapped in the different programmes, and I do not allude to them because they formed, generally speaking, the common property of all parties. The combat we had to face was that of three equal parties, with three distinct programmes. That was the statement of the sum. ^What was its working out? An all-Protectionist Ministry was defeated by the vote of the all-Labour Party, plus that of a segment of the Revenue Tariff Party. Next we saw an allLabour Ministry defeated by the all-Revenue Tariff Party, plus a segment of the Protectionist Party. seen an all-Revenue Tariff-Party in power, we should necessarily have witnessed a repetition of exactly the same procedure. As it was, a coalition was formed upon this side of the House, and it was immediately confronted-confronte d indeed by anticipation-by a coalition upon the other side of the House. If there had been no junction here there would have been none there-n o alliance. This brief outline brings me to the point in our journey which we have reached to-day. this side of the House. involve the debate. I use the word "" coalition,"" allowing each honourable member to place his own meaning upon it. Similarly, I shall use the term ""alliance,"" and leave honourable members 'to attach their own interpretation to it, because for the life of me I do not understand most of the meanings which are here given to these words. We find ourselves in the position of coalition fronting coalition, alliance fronting alliance, or combination fronting combination, but we do not find the existence of the present Government challenged upon any one definite line of policy by honourable members opposite. 9D got a policy. been challenged upon that ground. But instead the leader of the Opposition expounded the programme of his party, and made that exposition the main basis of his attack upon the Government. After the leader of the Ministry had replied, the late Attorney-General, who was second in command in the Watson Administration, continued the debate. Neither of them raised, except by the remotest implication, the fiscal question in any form. Indeed, until the speech of the honourable and learned member for Indi, who has dealt with that question from his own particular stand-point, we have waited for any declaration, even by way of criticism, of what the fiscal views of honourable members opposite are, or may be. Consequently this debate has been turned aside from any one particular set of questions. What we have really debated in one way or another, ever since this motion was submitted, has been that situation in the House-whic h reflects fhe past situation of the country-wit h some anticipations as to what the verdict of the country would be if appealed to at the preHad we subsequently sent juncture. As a matter of fact, it cannot yet be pretended-and I do not for a moment pretend-that upon either side of the House we have reached a fusion of parties. We have reached a confusion, but not a fusion We have had programmes put forward from both sides of the House, ostensibly, and, indeed, ostentatiously, temporary in their duration. There seems to be a general agreement that whatever we are to do ' has to be done today, but what to-morrow will bring forth the most enterprising prophet has scarcely seen his way to foretell. We are in process of that better adjustment which was seen to be inevitable from the moment the first electoral returns were published, and which, for my own part, I have endeavoured to hasten-whethe r for good or for ill-by all the means in my power. It appeared to me from the commencementI speak f o i myself only, though many others shared the same opinion-that the three equal parties in this House could not' be maintained, that either with or without our will, wish or without our assistance, the machinery of the constitutional Government of which we form a part, the conditions of party warfare, the nature of the business transacted in this House, and the methods of thought of our people,",34,Honourable Members Hear Hear

To which, I repliedSoI would have done. and the honourable member saidThen there is no obligation. If that be the view taken generally by members on the Opposition benches, there can be no reproach levelled at members of the Barton Government if they expressed no obligation for the assistance they received at other times froma number of members of the Labour Party. The Labour Party, as the honourable member for Bland says, voted with the. then Government only when they thought it right--the y voted to keep that Government in only when they thought it advantageous-and the honourable member for Bland draws the conclusion that there is no obligation. There, however, I cannot quite agree with him. Although there may be no obligation to forfeit conscientious opinions, it is impossible for men to act together for any length of time, even intermittently, without being drawn into closer relation, and without incurring what I may venture to call, in another sense, an obligation. It seen,ed to me that in that Parliament it was possible for a closer and more permanent relation to be established between the Government, headed by Sir Edmund Barton, and, at all events, that portion of the Labour Party who share our fiscal views. Indeed, in the State of Victoria, for years before, many of us had maintained that the Labour Party was properly the left wing of the.Liberal Party, though the former followed a line of action which the bulk of the liberals were not prepared to take. At the same time there was, or ought to have been, a closer alliance. I can say, without fear of successful contradiction, that in Victoria, the years in which the Labour Party recognised their alliance with liberals and the same may be said of South Australia and New South Wales-were the years most fruitful in progressive measures. Consequently I did not see then, and do not see now, any reason why, at all events, what might be termed the right wing of the Labour Party should not become, in a more permanent fashion, the left wing of the Liberal Partv.

When I speak of the "" right wing "" of labour, I mean that portion of the party which approaches more closely to the liberals, and by the ""left wing"" those who are the more removed. I use the word ""right,"" not in its moral significance, as contrasted with wrong, but in its physical significance as contrasted with "" l e f t . "" I saw no reason why, even in the last Parliament, the right wing of the Labour Party should not have been drawn into closer relations with the Government. I regret to notice the absence of my late colleague, the honourable member for Hume, to whom I should like to recall some conversation I had with him prior to my acceptance of the office of Prime Minister in succession to Sir Edmund Barton. I then pointed out, as doubtless the honourable member will recollect, the possibilities of the situation. I said it was probable that the alliance could not be brought about with myself as head of the Government, as well as it could be with some other colleague in that position. I then expressed my entire willingness to stand aside out of the Government altogether, if by that means there could be promoted the establishment of a party able to appeal to the country on a united platform. That, however, proved impossible of realization, for reasons with which I , personally, am not acquainted. But, upon accepting the grave responsibilities that consequently fell upon me, I was obliged, from my knowledge, of the situation, to proceed without alliance, simply propounding a programme which my colleagues and I thought ought to commend itself to the people of the Commonwealth generally. We placed before them as a short and simple summary of that programme-althoug h it comprised a great deal in a few .words-the statement that our policy was fiscal peace and preferential trade for a White Australia. I think we can claim, as a result of the election, that a considerable majority' was returned to this House in favour of each of these three most important planks.",35,Honourable Members Hear Hear

It will thus be seen that for the position that has since been created, a large share of responsibility lies with those who, being well able to foresee all that has necessarily followed, pledged themselves before their constituents to take a view opposite to that the Government submitted, which must necessarily occasion its retirement. I am not challenging, even by implication, their right to adopt that course'; I am merely pointing out that they made it with their eyes open. us not only three equal parties, but many certainties. jority of this House, pledged to follow a course which members knew would mean the retirement of the Government of the day. .tion. therefore, does not rest upon our -shoulders. and supporters a fair choice, and they accepted it. plain, and never will. turns proved not only in that respect, but in others, that we had what I at once publicly termed an ""impossible"" Parliament.

Could there be any doubt that, in these circumstances, we must not expect the ordinary line of business to be pursued, and ordinary results to follow ? Was it not absolutely certain, from In language the very outset, that those figures and those divisions meant, as I said the night before the elections, wavering returns, and a Parliament with a wavering majority ? We were sent here, as we have often been reminded, by the electors, to work out that it out. It was my duty, as I thought then, to point out from the very first-and I think honourable members will recollect that I did-the hopelessness of the position, and the fact that, painful as it was If we wer-e and dangerous, and trying to all of us, we had to look forward to a severance of parties. We had to promote a re-grouping in order that the business of the country, as far as it could be represented by a majority in this Chamber, might be carried on. I took a very early opportu nity in the year-a t the Australian Natives' Association luncheon-to put the homely parable of the three cricket elevens, and one or two other illustrations, with a view so far as was possible, to prepare the minds of the people and of their representatives for what was likely to follow. From that time forward, in an The election returns showed informal way, I proceeded, as I had indeed for some time previously, to indicate They showed us a clear mato a number of representative members of the Labour Party, that, so far as I-could judge, the time had come for their party to realize the new responsibilities of their The responsibility for our resignaposition as a third of the House.

I spoke in this way, not to one, but to a number of the party, many of them being amongst its most influential members. Individually all of them agreed more or less, and, so far as I could judge, They showed us not only much more than less, with that view. They all looked upon the proposal as'a very practical one, which ought, if possible, to be realized, but they had grave doubts, and experience has proved that they were",37,Honourable Members Hear Hear

156,Mr Deakin,"Although that was ajustified in entertaining those doubts, as to whether it could be realized. Speaking at the Australian Natives' Association luncheon, . I had foreshadowed an alliance, and made the one condition that it must be open, public and honourable. I had said that there must be no secret treaty, and that the alliance must necessarily be honourable to both parties, or the country could not be expected to approve of it. I have never made any secret of that. WhatI said and did is sometimes spoken of as an overture, and it was an overture, if that word 'be used in the sense of an invitation. I was never able to make a practical overture as to particular details or conditions, but invited proposals from those who I thought understood the position of their party much better than I could, who would be able to propose a basis for discussion. The correct statement would be to say that I invited overtures. At the same time, I do not quarrel with the general version that has been given to this House by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, previously given by him with a good deal of detail at Ballarat at an early date in the session. The honourable and learned member is so oratorically gifted that he coruscated, especially in this House, to an extent that would require me to quote some three columns of Hansard in order to give honourable members all that he said on this point. I think I shall be doing the honourable and learned gentleman no injustice if I quote a passage referring to the same matter from his Ballarat speech, because it is briefer. It was the speech to which I at once replied. Speaking of myself, the honourable and learned member saidHe was willing to ally himself with us only six months ago. He was willing, yea, he wa|s anxious, to do so. He was ready to form a coalition. He invited a coalition. It stands written in letters of brass that all men may read : he was willing to ally himself. He said it was a natural coalition. It was the only thing possible. On the one side, he said, the Liberals; on the other side the reactionists. He tried to form an alliance, not in the future, not when we had amended our organization, but he proposed it before Parliament met, and while it met. He was ready and willing to ally himself with us then. As I say, allowing for the coruscations and little adornments to which I have referred, that is substantially correct. learned gentleman was courting two girls at that time. one got the best of it. learned gentleman will live to regret it. I was courting no girl. I was doing what 1 would have been impossible if the Prime Minister's parable is to be approved. year, and the girls were courting the honourable and learned gentleman. something which would have b""een possible only in leap year. I . . was inviting courtship from others. I was at that time inviting overtures! only from my honourable friends opposite, because I thought they were entitled to be given the opportunity to make the first offer. I am happv to be able to say that in this course I had the approval of the present Prime Minister. At page 91, of Hansard, for this session, it will be found that the right honourable gentleman is reported to have said, referring to myselfI agree with the Prime Minister that there is no objection to an alliance between the Labour Party and the Ministry. And the right honourable gentleman went on to addAnd that was my policy in New South Wales. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney, at Ballarat, made the statement to which I have referred. Speaking a week later in Ballarat, I said that the honourable and learned gentleman's statement was substantially true. I referred to the matter later in this House. If honourable members care to refer to what I said, they will find at pages 1335 and 'i'&Tfia and more recently at page 4237 of Hansard, that oh different occasions in this House, I have made no secret whatever-as I never did-of this transaction. I made no secret of it to this extent: that what I was inviting was a proposal from one side or the other on which we could commence a discussion as to policy and details which might lead to a profitable decision. As I never obtained any such proposal, I was never in a position to submit anything on the subject to the Cabinet, of which I was the head. I received, as I have said, the utmost encouragement from individual honourable members, but it was not until a subsequent date, to which I shall presently allude, that we received any formal overture from the Labour Party with members of which I was then in",38,Honourable Members Hear Hear

It became my duty to pointedly call the atA s far as I know, yes. tention of the Prime Minister to this fact, because, although his first opportunity of forming a majority Government by coalition I am sure they had more desire had been passed by, I felt quite confident that the possibilities and the necessities of taking some such step must press themselves upon my honourable friends, as soon as they really felt upon their shoulders the f u l l burden of carrying on the business of the House. When I spoke upon that occasion I used words which have often been quoted since, in which I undertook, on behalf of the members with whom I was associated, that Ministers should have fair play. I shall presently give my reasons for thinking that, so far as we were concerned, they always obtained that fair play in every sense of the words, and especially when measured by their standards.

I pointed to the hazardous circumstances surrounding them, and pressed them in so many words to take whatever steps they felt right and necessary to command a majority in this Housei f they hoped to carry on with satisfaction to themselves. I pressed that clearly upon them here. They were also warned for some time in t'he most friendly manner in the Melbourne press that their position could not be maintained, and that unless they introduced some new elements into their ranks in a solid and permanent way, they could not hope to carry on. The Prime Minister and I met on the oth May. we had assumed office. spoken of my honourable friend taking office, and am now coming to the time subsequent to that event. But in order to refresh the recollections of honourable members, I maymention that on the 28th Apri l my right honourable friend, the member for East Sydney, had received the authority of his party to make overtures to us, with a view to an alliance; and that fact was notified in the press. It was on the 9th May that the Prime Minister, the member for Bland, lunched with the Lord Mayor in the Town Hall. I only remind him of this luncheon because there I spoke out even more freely. I told my honourable friend that the obstacles in his way were, first the organization behind him, with which others would have to deal if they entered into an alliance, and then the character of its programme. I reminded him that we had an impossible Parliament, and warned him that there could be no surety of his retaining the command of . the House unless he was prepared for that radical step of which I have spoken, and which, of course, I did not venture to dictate. There was more than one contingency open to him, but it was possible for him, as I pointed out. to take steps which would bring behind him a majority in the House. AgainI appealed to him, for the sake of the Government, the continuity of administration, and the work of Parliament, to take those steps. the Protectionist Party as much loyal support as it had received from the Labour Partv he would have had the majority. got was a solid vote to put us out merely because we would not exclude coloured aliens by name, though we absolutely excluded them by other means.

In the Herald of the n t h , the then Prime Minister announced, first, that he had no knowledge of these approaches which had been made towards a coalition, and went on to^say that in his judgment the time was hardly ripe; and, finally, that the time had not come at present. Up to that date I had received no overture or invitation from my right honourable friend the present Prime Minister. that he was waiting for an offer. me that I was to receive offers, but not to make them. Up to that time the whole of the communications which had passed, between myself and others as to a coalition were with different members of the Labour Party. , They put me under no misapprehension. They never pretended to speak officially for their-party or to bind any one but themselves and others whose names they mentioned to me. They did not mislead me in any way. I could not obtain any offer from them, nor would my friends opposite have obtained their present alliance with them but for the action I have taken. It has been forced on by the coalition here.

He was elected before the Payment of Members Act was passed, and sat here at night, earning his living at his trade by day. His reputation has always been unsullied; he was a worthy precursor of those who have f o l lowed him. Then in 1873, long before there was a Labour PartyMr Don having passed away-the first Victorian Fac tory Act was passed. It was a measure of six clauses, of which three were formal, while three were operative. this measure because the honourable member for Echuca, who made a statement in regard to it, was contradicted by some honourable member sitting on the Opposition side of the Chamber, There were only three effective clauses in that Bill, but of course prior to 1873 prac tically no industrial legislation had been passed. The first clause provided that every manufactory in which ten persons were employed should be considered a fac tory for the purposes of the B ill . second provided that females should not be employed for more than eight hours daily, but no age limit was imposed as to males or females. clause gave the Boards of Health, constituted of members of municipal bodies, control over sanitary and other conditions. That was the whole of the Bill, and in 1873 it marked an important advance. was no other Factory Act in Victoria until I had the honour of introducing a Bill in 1884. and Factories Commission of 1881-2, which found itself obliged to report that the old Act had broken down, that the provision for bringing factories in"" which ten persons were employed within the scope of the measure had been rendered nugatory, because large employers had distributed their hands over a number of small buildings, and had thus evaded the law, and that the provision with regard to females had also largely failed to accomplish its purpose, because no age limit had been imposed. It was also reported by them that the control of the Boards of Health everywhere outside of the city of Melbourne had little effect, and over the greater part of the country, no effect at all. Therefore it became necessary to pass my Bill. laid the foundation of the Acts passed in other States and in New Zealand, but still T h a t is so. I think constitutes the most substantial part of the Victorian Shops and Factories Act of today. The Bill introduced by me contained sixty-three clauses instead of six, and instead of occupying one page of the statute-book, extended over twenty-nine pages of the .edition of 1890. I endeavoured to have the number of employees constituting a factory reduced to two, but the Legislative Assembly raised the number to four, and the Legislative Council increased it still further, to six. We fought the matter out in the upper Chamber, but rather than lose the Bill, surrendered. We provided that every place I allude to in which machinery was used was to be regarded as a factory, and also that every work-room in which Chinese were employed, should also come within the scope of the Bill. It was further provided that all associated buildings used by a common employer should be regarded as one factory. TheB ill also provided for the registration and inspection of factories. Further, it was enacted that children should not be employed unless a medical certificate was furnished to the The effect that they were physically fit to' follow the occupation in which they were engagedThe factories were to be regulated, and work was only to be carried on for a cerThe third tain number of hours per week. Records of the work were to be kept, also a register of all those employed in the factories. In addition to that, the first blow was struck at sweating by a provision which There required that a record should be kept of all work done outside the factories. The buildings were to be supervised as to their I had been a member of the Shops construction, and sanitary requirements were to be f u l l y met. Children under the age of thirteen were not to be employed, and the employment of boys and girls under the age of fifteen was permitted only in cases where certificates' were furnished as to their fitness for employment, and to the effect that they had passed the educational standard. Furthermore, boys under the age of fourteen, and girls under the age of sixteen, were not. to be employed between the hours of 6p.m. and 6 a.m. Provision was also made for the protection of machinery, for safeuards against accidents, and for the penal' compensation of workmen who might be iniured whilst at work in the factories.

Sir otheis? protection is so important that, in order to complete the structure of the Bill, the inclusion of the provision is justified. none the less do I recognise that the provision is capable of being used as a weapon of offence, though, in that regard, my fears have been largely removed by the amendment introduced, at our request, which provides that the Court may review or qualify any preference which has been granted, if it be abused in the manner I have indicated. Admitting the very exceptional nature of this power, Ave have to ask ourselves whether the restriction of its use to cases where the majority of those concerned so desire, is reasonable, or unreasonable. MavI first point out that here, again, as in the ""preceding case, the power of award is untouched. the Court to make an award, granting preferences asked for only by a minorityit may be a mere handful of those concerned. Court to make a common rule within certain limits at the request of a minority-no t a minority in the area named, but a minority of those engaged in the industry. We leave the power of obtaining preferences by agreement now often used in New South Wales. What we have done here, as in other cases, is only to put a limitation on the power of the Court when a genera] preference is being granted. What does the restriction mean? An award is made when definite parties are before the Court-a n organization of employees on the one side, an organization of employers, or a single employer, on the other-and in all industrial matters, the judgment of the Court is to be binding. That marks an immense advance for which there is as yet comparatively little precedent. But beyond that we provide for a common rule. granting of a common rule over the Commonwealth, or any large part, of it, is very different from the granting of a common rule within a State. Do we realize how far this is taking us beyond anything vet experienced ? I must sav that I listened this afternoon with something like amazement to the honourable and learned member for Indi, as I have listened to other honourable members, speaking lightly of the granting of preference by a common rule throughout Australia, and making the vastness of its area and the number of its people an objection to majority rule. Are the greater number of the JOHN FORREST -What about the people of this country to be ignored, or the circumstances of, say, Western Australia. I recognise that this or of Queensland to be forgotten, while there issues from some central spot, at the request of a minority, an order that all But employment throughout Australia in a particular industry shall be vested first in the members of an organization ? No one could have stated more strongly my own case, qr proved the dangers and risks attendant on the giving of preference when the grant is to apply, not to one State only, but to the whole of this Commonwealth,with its immense territory, and scattered population. It may be said that the Court will not lightly or readily grant preference. I admit that. We have to trust the Court. But have we taken into account .the practical difficulties of climate, of employment, and of situation, in the conditions of living, and in the conveniences of life? When honorWe leave it in the power of able members talk lightly of our placing difficulties in the way of granting preference, it is well to ask whether they have considered how many other difficulties the Court will We leave it in the power of the have to surmount before it will be able to grant a preference, and how serious will it be when, if it can overcome them, it sends forth its ukase to more than 3,000,000 people, and over 3,000 square miles, to say that members of an organization in a certain industry, and no others until they are satisfied, are to obtain employment. It is the consideration of those' very circumstances and conditions that show us how unreal such a contention is in the Federal sphere when pushed to its extreme. A dispute cannot come within the jurisdiction of our Court until it extends beyond one State. In special cases, of course, there may be a comparatively small dispute on each side of the border-fine of two States, but those, we are assured will be rare. That assurance is probably correct. The honourable member for Darling with his great experiAsI pointed out, the ence, tells us that, in his opinion, this Arbitration Bill will be used only by the great Inter-State organizations and in relation to their disputes. If it be used only in great Inter-State disputes, how serious; a thing it will be for the Court to exercise this immense power to grant a preference over it may be two or three States, or the whole Commonwealth.",49,Honourable Members Hear Hear
281,Mr Deakin,"In my opinion, the physical and outlying conditions generally will be such as to necessarily condition the granting of preference, and that, therefore, very considerably diminishes the importance which is at present being attached to this question. The practical course will be the granting of preferences only within certain defined areas. I think we may safely assume that this will be the practice of the Court. It will not attempt, when dealing with a dispute on the borders of New South Wales and South Australia, to extend a common rule for preference to Western Australia on the. one side, or to Queensland on the other, unless in very special circumstances. vided against in the Bill. aware that it is ; and the fact buttresses my argument in this way : That when the Court has to deal with only a definite area a part of two States, or parts of three States or more, as the case may be-the difficulties which my honourable friends opposite have been conjuring up as to satisfying the Court that an application for preference has the approval of a majority of those to be affected are largely removed. If the Court chooses to grant a preference to rover the whole of the desert interior of Australia, and to search through that desert to find the odd man or two in some pastoral pursuit to be affected by its award it may; but it is practically preposterous to imagine such a case. the Court will have to deal with will be disputes between great organizations in contiguous districts, and affecting a large number of persons, and in these circumstances the difficulties of showing a majority which have been conjured up in regard to preferences applying to the whole of Australia practically disappear. reply to the honourable and learned member for Indi. ences in the case of the seamen, who follow a special occupation, and of the shearers, with a possible differentiation of the rule to two or three different classes of cases in different parts of the country. think of two or three cases like these, in which a preference may possiblv be applied to the whole of Australia, and in those I see no great difficulty in fulfillin g the requirements of clause 48. cases, if we commence to construct imaginary ones, we find that the limitations imposed by the very circumstances of the situation get rid of the difficulties as to satisfying the Court, which were thought to exist. Among the professional members of the House, the honourable and learned members for Indi and Darling Downs are two to whom I have always listened with the greatest respect. Now, having expressed my appreciation of their standing, allow me to say, that, with all diffidence, I utterly and absolutely disagree with their legal reading of clause 48 and its supposed implications. I take the responsibility of my opinion by expressing it in public, and assert that a Court constituted for industrial purposes with the mandate set out in the Billa Court which is to be a judicial body of a new type, dealing with industrial questions with a free hand, and in I am perfectly well a new way-woul d be false to its duties, and to the whole spirit of the measure, if it endeavoured to insist upon the mathematical precision of calculation as to majorities which the honourable and learned member for Indi mentioned, or to make the elaborate searches which he would impose upon it. What is the only case in which, so far as we know, a Supreme Court Judge has complained of having a difficulty cast upon him in administering a measure of this kind ? It is that in which a Judge of the Supreme Court of Western Australia, when sitting in the State Conciliation and Arbitration Court, protested that his position there required him to put all his legal knowledge behind him, to set aside What all restrictions as to evidence, to pay no regard to conditions that he must ordinarily demand, so as to decide the question before him, not according to legal forms, but in good conscience and common sense. That being so, what becomes of all the fine, technical, legal cobwebs which the honourable and learned member for Indi has spun? I hold that no Judge whom we might select would be worthy of his position if he allowed himself to suppose that Parliament, when it provided that this Court should see that a majority of those affected approved of an application for preference, required him to turn to statistics, to take a referendum, or a count of heads. The Judge will have to be satisfied, in his own mind, that the application before him is approved We can by a, majority of those affected. I go further, and say that, in my opinion, he will not even need to ask himself the question whether it has been expressly approved, but whether, on the evidence before him, it is Outside those of such a nature as to commend itself to them.",50,Honourable Members Hear Hear

He will look a minority against a majority, how much at the districts to. which he will be limited, more are we called upon here to protect look at the physical conditions within those the majority against the minority?

One was with reference to the political element in unions, and, by the way, I am indebted to the honourable member for Moira for reminding me that I did give a clear indication on the second reading during the speech of the honourable member for Wentworth. When he intimated that possibly under the Bill an organization might be used for political purposes, I assured him that there was no such intention in my mind, and that it would be made perfectly clear. That leaves me with only one vote qualifying the Bill, as it stood, which was not indicated in my second-reading speech.

I gave my vote when the question was not vital, and when I had no expectation that it would be vital; and that vote was not cast against anything in the Bill, but simply to put in a proviso clearly stating what honourable members opposite admitted would, in the vast majority of cases, be read into the measure by the Court itself. I venture! to say that there are utterly incorrect. It was merely a political few Ministers who have kept so closely to Bills of which they have been in charge. But the members of the late Government., as I have shown, laid sacrilegious hands on the work of my late colleague and their great exemplar in a variety of serious matters. Fortunately we were able to prevent those attempts to impair it, and usually preachieve his present position under the diffivented them without a division. But honourable members opposite when they take credit for the moderation which they assumed in regard to that and other matters, have to re he did not deal fairly with my complaint collect that in a House consisting of three It was no criterion as parties, whichever party is in power has to study moderation. When labour members opposite and their colleagues sat upon these benches they were doomed to moderation beforehand, because the)' had only a In fact, it was not moderation, it was minority-ration, that ruled. This checked honourable members opposite, and checked them not only in connection with the Arbitration Bill.

But, as we have reason to know, £Hat moderation, if they had behind them a majority of their own party, would not have been allowed to have the free play which it obtained under the then existing circumstances.

338,Mr Deakin,"Speaking from memory,against the Labour Party; and, as a consequence, it has not been fairly presented by many other critics in this House, including the honourable member for Kennedy last night. I criticised the machinery of the Labour Party, but commenced by saying that admittedly every party had machinery, and thatother parties had abused their machinery. WhatI was criticising was not the use of party machinery, but its abuse when the machine became the master, instead of being controlled by men who were using it for proper purposes. I think that this criticism has been fully justified by subsequent events. For instance, I pointed out that every political Organization, to be effective, must have local committees; but I also pointed out that in the Labour Party-no t in all cases, I was careful to say, but in some casesa mere handful of men, without any standing out of their own party, or perhaps in if, without any knowledge outside their own particular localities, were exercising authority over the choice of candidates, and stepping in between candidates for Parliament and the people, in a way which ought not to be permitted to bodies of that kind. Now, I find that the late Prime Minister has lately confirmed-no t intentionally, of course-that statement. The honourable member said' It was true that the labour members of Parliawas technically kept outside of their movement, ment were the result of organizations, were governed by the rules of organizations, worked by a platform prepared by organizations, and had to abide by decisions in caucus. So far so good. which in itself shows how dangerous the possession of such great power is in the hands of any body of men who are not numerous enough to be thoroughly representative of the constituencies to which they profess to hold the right to open or close the door. entered Parliament labour members were the sole interpreters of the platform under which the party was elected. that in a minute. ' My complaint is not against the local committees of the Labour Party. A .large number of them are representative,and speak'for a large body of constituents. But the power lodged in them is a dangerous one, and when, as I have known instances, thirty or forty men gathered together in one constituency arrogate to themselves the right to say who shall stand, and who shall not, the organization deserves the criticism which it has received. paper not merely nominating candidates, but dictating the policy of a country ? tionable from the public point of view.

The leader of the Opposition went on to sayIn regard to none of these things did the alliance in the slightest degree' infringe upon the authority which the organizations undoubtedly possess. The labour members of the Federal Parliament had agreed to use their influence towards securing to those who were members of the alliance immunity from opposition. If an organization desired to put forward a candidate in opposition to those who were combining with the Labour Party, there was nothing to prevent them doing so; but if a man who, by some means, though voting straight with them, had the best chance of winning the seat, in his view of the case, it would be suicidal to oppose him. very properly from those who are safe inside the party.

My sympathies are with the members of the party in this House, who, with their better training and fuller knowledge of the circumstances, are aware that they can never seize and retain the keys of power without the support of a majority, and know that the country will never give them that support unless moderate views prevail, and a practical programme is put before it, while at the same time fair play is extended to their allies.

They might have been very useful as they went into the wash, but they certainly came out of it in a form which was neither useful nor ornamental. Upon these subjects, the alliance programme is practically a blank. Further, I have not noticed any reference to a number of other important subjects, which should have been included in that programme. For example, there is no reference to the problem of how we may best attract population, or decrease our debt. No proposals have been submitted for dealing with the water rc ources of the States, so far as they come within Federal authority, or for assisting in the settlement of disputes which approach' its jurisdiction. , want of confidence in the alliance. becomes. Of course, it may be said that in this respect the programme of the Ministry is not all precision and definiteness. The Government offer a programme of practical work for this session, which constitutes quite as much as we can do. Beyond and behind that programme, we have the Government itself, and I have no hesitation in saying that the four members of the Ministry who represent the party to which I have always belonged, possess our unqualified confidence. We know them, we have tried them, and we are quite content to trust to their loyalty to their principles. We could not find better men. And so of the four members headed by the Prime Minister-the y are equally representative of their party, and rank as its very ablest men. We are satisfied that we can trust the Government. Further, we retain the right of free criticism of the Government which we sit behind. We do not move under any bond, shackle, or compact. All our engagements are known to the public. I am certain that the honourable and learned member for Indi, who has served with two out of the four protectionists in the Ministry, will admit that no more trustworthy men have ever represented us in Parliament, and certainly no men whose adherence to that policv has been stauncher. What better guarantee for its future can we obtain than their presence in the Cabinet? They are there to give effect to their pledges. When they cease to do that, it will be time enough for us to reconsider the situation. But I do not anticipate that any such occasion will arise. The other members of the Government represent the revenue Tariff doctrines as well as the protectionist members represent protectionist doctrines. There are no more competent men in this House. Consequently I claim that we have something to inspire us with confidence as to the future. We are not pledged, and we are not asked to pledge ourselves for an indefinite period, to proposals of which we know nothing. On the contrary, we have the assurance that whenever this Government takes an important step, or develops new principles, it will be with the approbation of the whole of the members sitting behind them. honourable member for Wilmot. ber's party was glad to get rid of him. myself occupy quite a paternal position in this House, because we may fairly claimlooking back to the Ballarat scheme-to be the fathers both of the policy of the late Government and of the present Administration.

That has often been done in the States. were instances when the business was taken out of the hands of a Government. In our case the circumstances were not the same. only, but also of substance.

Again, in taking a vote of want of confidence on a question of form, the unfairness lies in the fact that votes are given against the Government by members merely from a desire to remove the Government. the Opposition, instead of gaining votes, actually lost the vote of the honourable member for Barker. of the Chairman of Committees. the Chairman of Committees, but that did not balance the loss of a vote actually recorded against them. of the complaint about taking the business congratulations from the present Prime out of the hands of the Government,, lies in the fact that a vote' is given, not on a question of substance, but on a question of form.

There could be nothing more colourless than the late Government was on the fiscal question, if we take colour to necessarily mean protectionist colour.

Under the circumstances it is not surprising that the protectionist journal, the Melbourne Age. if my memory serves me right, on the very day of the division which decided the fate of the Government branded it as "" hostile to protection,"" and asked how a protectionist could support it.

That motion is to be carried by the votes of those who will support it only if there be nothing more important in their platform going at the time. We cannot treat the alliance as being complete; it is not complete. It is in embryo, and an embryo is never a pretty thing to look at. An embryo, however, has immense potencies. It may grow; it may become fully fledged and play an important part. It is quite possible that this may grow into something most satisfactory, but at present it is a case not of alliance, of programme, of proof, or of substance, .but a case of hope, belief, expectation, trust, confidenceanything you like, except the actual facts. death. at least as positive and potential as the allicontest now to be commenced lies between those ance has become, after a long and anxious incubation. in regard to the fiscal question is absolutely unaltered. I have no desire to weary honourable members, but have before me a report of the policy speech that I delivered at Ballarat on 29th October last, at the opening of. the election campaign, and I desire to read an extract from itOne of the great results of the unremitting labours of the Parliament has been the passing of the first Federal Tariff. During the whole of the period while it was being discussed business was disturbed, uncertainty prevailed, and trade was paralyzed. If that Tariff is to be wantonly reopened now, precisely the same conditions must recur. Importers and manufacturers are becoming adapted to it. The public have just learnt to' look below that label which used to be put up at first, "" Raised in consequence of the Tariff,"" only to find very often that the article was on the free list. The public, purchasers and ' traders, have come to understand the Tariff, or most of it, and are living under it, to the amazement of some of our free-trade friends, without finding the cost of living enhanced. Yet, just at present we are met with the proposal that this Tariff is to be torn up, and we are to be launched once more on the sea of uncertainty. A proposal of that kind is neither wise, statesmanlike, nor reasonable. The Tariff, whatever its defects, and I don't deny them, is entitled to a fair trial. At all events, the community is entitled to rest, and the business people to know where they are. Of course, the proposition is being steadily whittled down. First, the whole Tariff was to go; then all the protectionist duties were to go; now some of them are to go. At last it is a mild Tariff revision; it is only a little one. But the question whether the TariffThat is, the Tariff discussionif it begins, shall be a little one or a large one, does not rest with the people who propose a little one. That applies to the present timeThat Tariff was accepted by us simply because some Australian Tariff must be passed, 'and because of the losses incurred in consequence of the prolonged discussion. For these we sacrificed much. This is not the protectionist Tariff to which we have been accustomed, and for which we hoped. Some industries have been destroyed by this Tariff; some others have been injured, and many have not been assisted. Of course they had the extra opportunities afforded by InterState free-trade. But for its compensations others might not have survived. If the Tariff is torn open we shall, of course, employ every means we possess to repair the omissions and mistakes in the present schedule of duties. They are numerous. The strife will be long. Relying upon the energy of our people, and the operation of Inter-State free-trade, we accepted that Tariff for want of a better. On the same public grounds, putting aside our own desires and beliefs as to what is best, we are preparecr to preserve that Tariff, because we ""believe that the best boon to this community that its public men can give it is fiscal peace. The clean-cut issue then in the who hold with us that what we need is time to adjust ourselves to our new conditions without "" My own position another Tariff campaign in Parliament.

452,Mr Deakin,"On the contrary, it is to expect nothing but baneful influences. The very fact that we are willing to wait and trust to this experience shows our confidence in the working of the protectionist part of this Tariff. Those who are in haste to alter it before it can be f u l l y appreciated prove that they realize that the tide of public opinion and experience will be against thera. They know, and have reason to believe, that it will be easier for them to alter it now than ever again. For the same reason those who cherish fiscal peace, or have faith in the principle of protection, should realize that this is not the hour when we should again commence to tinker with the Tariff-to indulge in a wasteful kindling of the fires of strife, when trade is beginning to follow the new channels it has made-and to undo for the purpose of undoing. These are the aims of those who oppose the Government. When I last addressed you I estimated that at least half-a-million people in Australia, directly or indirectly, were dependent on the protected trades. That number hasnow been much increased, aDd is being increased, especially in Sydney. It is the operation of this Tariff which will inevitably strengthen in the future the protectionist knowledge and sentiment of the whole community. Those who are engaged in our industries have no right to see their earnings threatened at the very time they are promised good seasons and revival of business. The tide of prosperity is just beginning to flow, and it is indefensible to prevent it by a renewal of fiscal strife. The permanent planks of the Liberal and Ministerial policy are the maintenance of the Tariff and fiscal peace. As a valuable corollary we hope to pass in the next Parliament a measure which we were prevented by time alone from passing last session. I refer to the short B ill to prevent the growth of rings and trusts in Australia, or, if any such exist, enabling us to cope with them.

I do not propose to depend solely on my own recollection, but turn to an authority which I believe the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and the whole Protectionist Party will accept. I can show how clearly my views were understood by quoting some extracts from articles which appeared in the Melbourne Age, explaining and recommending them to the public On the 30th October, the day after I spoke at Ballarat, the Age, in a leading article referred to the proposals I made in this wayB u t especially of the The first and foremost necessity of the time is The country was a truce on the fiscal question. So long as that struggle goes on it bars the way to any progressive legislation on other national and social questions. The Opposition proposal for renewed strife on the Tariff is directly opposed to the Deakin policy of fiscal peace. Lower down in the same article I find thisAndi f , as is certain, the electors shall decide against any present re-opening of the Tariff question, that will not deter the protectionists at some future time from a further revision of the Federal Tariff in perfecting our protective system. Therefore, the Prime Minister's declaration for a present truce is a very convenient dividing line of parties. There is a time to draw the sword and I shall deal with that a time to sheath it.

That clause, so far from being a limitation upon any member, either of the Ministry or of the party, as the honourable and learned member simply because of the extracts which I have just read, which show not that the Prime Minister and I had made a compact which binds anybody, even ourselves, on this head, but that having promised the country fiscal peace for this Parliament, in the matter of Tariff revision, we put into the programme the pledge which we had given to the constituencies. I am surprised that my honourable and learned friend, when he was turning his powerful artillery on that clause, did not see that he was attacking not something' which the Prime Minister and I had done of ourselves, but something which the country had approved by a huge majority. . consent"" Government is concerned. have the right to break the order of the country ?

520,What We Declared Against Mr Deakin,"When my honorableknow them-the 5 per cent, protectionists, the 10 per cent, protectionists, and the 12j per cent, protectionists. turned for Victoria. was not my fault. What we must have when the Tariff is revised is efficient protection. ciently nigh to make them effective ah'd' no higher. I propose to say next to nothing on the question of the iron bounty, relying on the statement. I read in the press that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is to take charge of the measure at a very early date. We shall then be able to deal with it in fact and in effect. it? know yet what it is going to do. going to do? sure, going to help on the consideration of the Bill, which, I hope, will be carried. Touching as far as I may in this debate on the question of preferential trade, which was expressly excluded from the operation of fiscal peace, I find that it was dealt with at quite inordinate length in my Ballarat speech, from which I propose to make a few quotations. I saidOur maxims are that trade is a powerful tie making for unity; that common investments make common interests; strengthening us when built up within the Empire, and weakening us when transferred to our rivals. As a man's first duty is to provide for his own family, it . is a statesman's first duty to provide for his own people. No nation in the world has feared to raise its protective duties against Great Britain; but now we are told Great Britain should hesitate to raise its duties, because of the danger of reprisals. Are we then so much more at their mercy, so much more dependent upon them than they are upon us with all our commerce? Our conviction is that we are free enough, and powerful enough, to protect ourselves without asking permission. We do not look only to price. The new economy looks to honest wares, truthful labels, fair wages, mentary to it, the electors have to decide whether and the distribution of profits of barter, as. far as possible, among our fellow citizens. It is national, as well as human. Again, sirI f the. Empire is to advance, it must be by the advance of all its parts. It is too huge, scattered, and diverse in conditions and character to be treated as a simple unit. We are told by the foreign trader that to speak of self-development in parts of the Empire is a doctrine which is selfishly Australian. Well, the late Secretary 9 E2 of State for the Colonies, and the Prime Ministers of all the over-sea possessions, met in London last year, and by resolution declared that free-trade within the Empire was impracticable, and that each of the Dominions must look to its own development. We are pursuing the lines laid down in these resolutions when we seek to make Australia a part of the Empire, whose trade is worth having. A protectionist Tariff is essential to Australia, but there is nothing in that antagWe must raise the duties suffionistic to close trade relations with the mother country. It is true patriotism which trades with its kindred and prefers its own productions. I was present at an Imperial Conference held in London in 1887, when Mr Hofmeyer made a most statesmanlike proposal. He suggested that a duty of 2 per cent, should be levied by Great Britain and her Dominions upon all foreign goods. It was calculated that from that small duty a revenue of some £7,000,000 would be obtained annually, which could be devoted to purposes of general defence. Not felt by the Empire, not felt by the Colonies, and paid by the foreigner, it would have enabled us to protect ourselves against the foreigner. Heartily supporting the proposal then, I support it still. There arc 'more modest proposals before us now from Mr Chamberlain, who has defined them with characteristic :-ourage and resource. I go on to describe them, and concludeWhen these proposals are lpade they will receive most cordial, most hearty, and most generous consideration at the hands of any truly Australian Government. And againWhen Mr Chamberlain made his proposals the Australian Government would be prepared to treat them generously, item by item, considering all the circumstances and the importance of the industries to the Commonwealth. If we are offered such a boon as his tentative scheme promises, we can afford to look with a liberal eye at the concessions which are asked from us. Once moreIn this matter the interests of Australia are one, and they are bound up with those of the rest of the Empire. My appeal is not to Victoria only, but to the whole of Australia. And so on. And to show that the position i.i regard to preferential trade was distinctly understood, I quote from leading articles in the Age. On 36th October the Age saidAlong with this peace policy, and as complethey are prepared to accept preferential trade or not. Mr Deakin invites Australians to embrace the preferential policy should England find herself in a position to offer it. . . . But on this point there is no need for Australia to leap before she comes to the fence. Details at this stage are premature. Mr Chamberlain may not succeed in his mission. That is a matter which rests in the future. Should he carry the mind of England with him, it.cannot be done for the next twelve months. Therefore, any overtures from Australia would be completely out of place.",68,Honourable Members Hear Hear

528,Mr Deakin,"The coalition' is, I amAnd againM i . Deakin says his Government will take no leap in the dark as Mr Reid is urging should be done. If the time for negotiation ever arrives in consequence ot Great Britain accepting the new policy, then will be the occasion for saying in what particulars'our Tariff should be modified in favour of England. Again, in the same articleMr Deakin's preferential policy is crystallized in a sentence, "" Great Britain must make the first move."" This is the sound position to assume. In an article on 2nd November, the Age saidMr Deakin's position is lucidity itself. He says that, should Mr Chamberlain find himself in a position to make that overture to the Colonies, he would respond heartily to Imperial reciprocity against the world, and be prepared at once to negotiate the details. There is a candour,' clearness, and definiteness in that. One knows exactly what it means. On 2nd MarchIt may be very fairly argue'd that Australia has done all that is incumbent on her in returning a Parliament' pledged to an Imperial reciprocal preference in trade. It now remains f o t England to say whether she desires it. It may be, as Mr Chamberlain himself once anticipated, that England will not accept preferential trade with her Colonies on the first time of asking. This is quite conceivable. And the article goes on to say that this Parliament can either pass a resolution or a measure dealing with the subject, to help Mr Chamberlain. On 3rd March the Age saidWhenever this question of preferential Tariff comes to be discussed, which is not likely to be at an early date, seeing that it does not press for settlement as other subjects do, a perfectly invincible case will be made out for it from a protectionist point of view. -Those who are further interested in the subject can turn to articles in the Age of .19th and 23rd October, 26th and 27th November, 19th December, 1903, 1st January .and 4th March, 1904. The same journal also pointed out, as late as 6th March, that this Parliament was elected for fiscal peace, and not for the consideration of a second Tariff Bill. Preferential trade is a great question, with which neither my time nor my strength-even if the patience of the House would permit-will enable me to deal as it deserves to be dealt with. It opens up a number of vast problems, and can be considered in many aspects, quite apart from fiscal strife. We have to ask ourselves-Do we desire closer relations with the mother country ? What material benefits can be reaped from them? Mr Deakin. What mutual sacrifices, if any, are required ? How will the proposal affect each partner? How will itaffect the Empire as a whole? Honourable members will take notice that my official announcement-and the press repeated it-wa s that we should wait for an offer from Great Britain, but I think I am breaking no secrets when I say that that delay was forced upon me by the opinions of others, and that my own desireI did not propose anything else to the country, and consequently am bound to nothing else -wa s that we should take the industries of the Commonwealth, and consider them at once in regard to the granting of preferences, in some such fashion as New Zealand has done. But at that time. I received no encouragement from any source. Neither in Parliament, nor out of it, was it con' sidered that the time was ripe for such an advance. Consequently,' I put the matter now merely as a personal view. But, during the time. I was in office, and after the elections, I did take preliminary steps-of which probably the present Minister of Trade and Customs is aware-by which the Customs Department was asked to take the New Zealand Act, together with the returns of Australian trade and commerce, so as to study all the items upon which preferences could be granted, either by increase or reduction of duties. The object was that when this Parliament thought that the question was sufficiently advanced to be dealt with we should have material ready at hand. I should hope that the course of that inquiry ( has not been interfered with, and that some considerable progress has been made by the Customs Department. If it has, we are so much nearer an opportunity for discussion, and consequently we ought to be prepared eventually, if the Customs Department itself cannot discharge those duties, or if it has only discharged a part of them, to call in the assistance of the Tariff Commission, when it can spare the time from other matters, to deal with this also in further 'detail. Because there are three different aspects of this subject. Remembering your warning, Mr Speaker, I shall not deal with them at any length. The first consideration is: What can be done for the mother country as a free gift, by means of' the imposition of increased duties upon goods which we import in a large measure from foreign countries ; but which we could obtain from the mother country in sufficient quantity, and at a fair price? That is the New Zealand plan, and involves no consultation with the mother country. It may not take us far, but it will take us some distance. In the second consideration there are two elements, the desire to make a gift, and the desire to make a gain. That makes it a question of bargain and exchange, which will require the examination, on both sides, of a large amount of details into which we must look carefully, and upon which we cannot enter until we have made some progress in exact knowledge of our import trade. Then comes the third consideration, which, in some respects, can be dealt with before the second-the possibility of taking advantage of the preference offered by South untouched, as in the United States, by either Africa, and other Colonies with whom we trade, for Imperial reciprocity which may be it, and keep it within reasonable limits. But of benefit to the various parts of the Empire. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -There is nothing to prevent us from doing that right off. whole scheme completely will take time, and thought, but in this, as in other questions, I trust time, thought, and the people. I believe that when all the possibilities are Treasury benches. Its members, and the realized-and I alluded to some of them at Ballarat, while others were ably developed by the honourable and learned, member for Indi to-day-w e shall find time, and sentiment clearing away many of the obstacles which our friends here at the present time fear, and trust that we shall'receive their aid in taking the first steps-whic h can be taken without delay-to achieve these great ends. Of course, as I have previouslypointed out to the House, this question depends very much for its development upon political events in the mother country. These have already affected our dealing with proposals of the kind, and the omens up to date continue rather unfavorable. Still, we can, and should, support Mr as it relates to immediate Tariff revision for Chamberlain by demonstrating our zeal in the great cause he is upholding at home. I am not afiscalist rv.erely for the sake, of view, in the change of Government. The fiscalism. I look at the question as inseparably bound up with a whole series of issues, local as well as Imperial, to which we were committed in the Ballarat programme. I hold that labour legislation' is impossible, or cannot be carried to its full, in the Cabinet, which did not subscribe or to anything like its full, effect, without to protection, as we in Victoria understand protection. It is the necessary corollary of a White Australia, dealing as it does with goods of coloured manufacture, as well as with the coloured person himself. The great national aims associated with our future expansion are ' not to be achieved in a day, but only after a thorough and fair examination of all the conditions. There will be vicissitudes and alternatives; but I hope to see the fiscal issue buried in Australia, as it has been buried in the United States and Canada, by becoming part of the accepted policy of the country. I hope that even those who now regard it with suspicion, whatever their theoretical views or opinions may be, will at last realize that it has been woven into the fabric of our national policy. While consenting that, in view of its operation throughout the whole area of national life and production, it should be allowed to go party, their aim will simply be to prune for the settlement of these questions we are necessarily looking to the far future. I am content to-day, as I was a year ago, with the policy embodied in the words, fiscal peace and preferential trade for a White Australia. The history of that policy has been checkered. The Government which propounded it is no longer upon the party which supported it, are divided. In conclusion, I have to consider the circumstances under which that division took place. When the Watson Government displaced us, it occupied its attention with matters in its' party programme which were only of an industrial nature. That was only one segment of our policy. As I have already shown, protection was entirely set aside by the Labour Party. The present Government have adopted practically the same attitude in that regard. They advocate fiscal peace, as the Watson Government did. They go on with that segment of the Ballarat policy just as the Watson Government did. They put protection aside, so far its own sake, as the Watson Government did. I see no loss, from a protectionist point of party to which I belong was founded in 1901, under Sir Edmund, then Mr Barton, on the principle of protection, its members holding diverse views on many other subjects. There was a minority, even it. The same difference existed in the party to such an extent that, as I have shown by recent references, many men who call themselves protectionists voted against us more often than with us. and for duties which were utterly ineffective.",69,Honourable Members Hear Hear
529,Mr Deakin,"No. To work out theWhen our time as a Government came, we fell on another question, and with us fell an all-protectionist Administration and an all-protectionist party. At the time, it protection; upon all other questions the was pointed out in the House, 'especially by those who voted against us. that the members of the party were free to deal with the Arbitration Bill as they pleased, since the bond which united us was the fiscal bond. That was their justification for the vote which displaced us. We were defeated as protectionists upon non-fiscal grounds by a coalition of fiscal atheism. What course did I follow when the life of my Government was threatened? called no meeting of the Protectionist Party, and sought to use no influence as leader of that party. I realized that on the Arbitration Bill honourable members might vote as they pleased, and yet remain full members of the Protectionist and Liberal Party. office, and party meetings were held immediately afterwards to consider the position. I took personal care that those who had voted against us, and others who intended to do so on the next amendment, but who belonged to the Protectionist Party, should be invited to those meetings, because I recognised that protection was the bond of our party. man who had voted me out of office on another question was debarred from having a voice-some of them had a large voicein our after proceedings. On the 2 8th April, Mr Reid was authorized to make overtures, and on the 17th May the proposed coalition was declined. We had a series of meetings in April and May. All this has appeared in the press, and therefore I am not revealing anything that has not already been disclosed. refreshed my memory by reading the press reports, which, in many respects, are untrustworthy. parts that are correct. From the first it became evident that the difference between us on the Arbitration Bill was not going to be the only difference. It was made clear that in connection with the proposed coalitions with the Labour Party on the one hand and with the Prime Minister on the other, certain honourable members were determined to vote for a particular coalition under any circumstances. check them, and they were allowed to go free and without reproach. Absolute liberty was accorded us to vote against each Mr Deakin. other, both in regard to the coalition and in connection with the Arbitration Bill. As the Age remarked, the one party bond was members of the party were free. As late as 2nd June the Age, summing up the reso-* lutions of the last caucus, saidMembers of Mr Deakin's party can take any "" course in ordinary politics they please, remaining solid on the one bond of fiscal unity. During these caucus meetings, as the reports show, no proposal was submitted by any one for Tariff revision or for a breach of fiscal peace in that respect. The subI ject was never raised, discussed, or considered. growth. tures were set aside, and we remained allied as protectionists to await events. At the My Government went out of conclusion of 'these meetings, I was asked to again accept the position of leader. In doing so, I rose to remind my associates that upon every other questioi. except the fiscal issue the position of leader was merely nominal, and asked how I cOuld possibly lead two bodies of men who had declared their intention to fight against each other upon the Arbitration Bill and the No proposed coalitions. I made it clear that the. only leadership possible was that which existed in connection with protection, because that was the only bond left to us, and subject to that condition I agreed to retain the position. We decided to act together as a party as long as possible. Now we come to the. time when the fall of the Watson Government was approaching. That was heralded by a series of paragraphs in the AgeI have always exceptionally well informed upon matters of this kind-whic h pointed to the discussions going on amongst certain I shall quote only those members of our party, with a view ' to the adoption of an independent attitude. These paragraphs are too jnumerousi to read, though I recently scanned them in order to refresh my memory. They begin by recounting the first difficulties into which the Watson Government fell. These difficulties were not of a fiscal character, because no Government could have been in a more hopeless position with regard to that question than was the Watson Administration. The difficulties related to the No attempt was made to Arbitration Bill and to nothing else.

It has been severed upon a question which had nothing whatever to do with protection. This separatist movement was started before the division upon the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill took place in the House, before it was known that the honourable member for Bland would not be granted a dissolution. Consequently it was not known that a new Administration would be formed. The intention was to separate from the Protectionist Party there and then, and to go to the country in support of the Watson Ministry, though its fiscal policy was not protectionist, and opposing the remainder of the protectionists from whom they differed on a non-fiscal vote for majority rule. Therefore, to connect the new party with protection is a mere afterthought, which has no justification in date or in the actual facts. more to say upon that point, but felt myself bound to say thus much. I called no meeting when the Administration which I led' was defeated because no fiscal question was involved, and in the second crisis, when the Watson Government relinquished office, behaved in exactly the same manner. Upon that occasion I did not use any influence with a single member, because the matter involved was not fiscal. I merely gave my own vote according to my conscience, because I believed in majority rule controlling preferences. Yet upon that division on the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill , my honourable friends opposite have been misguided enough to separate from us, not only discourteously, but without any warrant from the members of our party. utmost limit of my complaint. Their conduct, however, will not prevent me from acting with them in the future upon common principles. thought it necessary to take the course which they have adopted. stood together. learned' member say that anything we did, or did not do, was responsible for the coalition ? tion I sav "" No."" But the coalition on this r I subseside is responsible for theirs, because without my action the Labour Party would never have made even the slight concessions upon which the alliance has been started. I do think, however, that no members of any partu had a right to stand apart and impose upon its other members a condition in regard to which they had not been consulted before permitting them to enter a meeting with them. They chose to post a notice that any honourable member who would refuse to support the free-trade Prime Minister might attend. had decided that previously not decide that, if an equal position with the free-trade Prime Minister were given to a protectionist, and if the Prime Minister accepted the doctrine of fiscal peace, so that his free-trade views could not operate within a certain time, a coali tion should not be formed. cided that the Protectionist Partv should have nothing whatever to do with ""the right I have nothing honourable gentleman. had formed his party before he knew that there would be any other Prime Minister than the member for Bland. The only question which should have been discussed 1 by the separatist meeting which was called was the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill . Any other question should have been considered by a party meeting of the whole of the protectionists. A t all events, we should have been invited. Had it been suggested to me that a meeting of that party should be called, I should have been bound to convene one. Honourable members opposite would then have been free to argue out the question from a fiscal stand-point, that is, if they had at that time thought of raising ' it .

We are not sitting together, and the severance of honourable members opposite from our party is entirely voluntary and uncalled for.

I hold that the removal of the Watson Government was equally inevitable when once they . determined to act as a Government representing a n.inority.
