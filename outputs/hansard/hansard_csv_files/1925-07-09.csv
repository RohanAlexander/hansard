Minister If The Statement Appearing In Tbe Press To","day to the effect that tlie Government has coiiiuuinicnteii with the Commonwealth Shipping Board asking the reason why ir came to a settlement with the seamen in connection with rlie shipping disputs, is correct ' If so., how does the right honourable gentleman reconcile this action of the Government with the statement he made when the Shipping Board was appointed, to the effect that it was necessary rhat there should be no political interference with the work of the board in order that the Commonwealth line of steamer? might have every opportunity to prove itself a paying concern ? interfered with the control of the Commonwealth Lino of steamers, or brought any political influence to bear on the Shipping Board. I communicated with the board after I saw the notification of the settlement it had arrived at. and asked, for the information of the Government, to be informed as to what exactly was the action which the board had taken. that the right honourable gentleman's reply indicates that the statements appearing in the press are not correct, and rhat the Government did not demand an explanation of its action from the Shipping Board? whnt statements have appeared in the press, but the facts are as I have stated in reply to the Leader of the Opposition. I have communicated with the Shipping Bonsd asking for information. ihe statement made by the Prime Minister yesterday in connection with the cruiser Brisbane, I ask whether the right honourable gentleman; will consider tbe desirability of cornmimicating with tbe British Government, stating that in view of the conditions in China, if tbe Admiralty desires, or thinks it necessary, to use the Brisbane in any way to ensure the safety of Australians or other British subjects, its action in doing so will have the approval of the majority of this House., and of the rigkt-thiukiug people of Australia ? made it clear that while attached to it the Brisbane can be used in connection with auy action taken by the China Sound ron to preserve the lives and properties of British stibjects. That is (-tefirlv understood by the British Government. Governments yet agreed to the Commonwealth migration scheme, aud, if so, will the Prime Minister say which of thcim has agreed to it? ment has intimated that it has accepted the scheme, but I do not think that the official notification of its acceptance has yet been sent. Early this week I had a conference with the Premiers of -Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia, and Victoria. Wo discussed the -whole of the provisions of the migration agrecmenx. There were certain provisions they wished to have clarified. As« result of the conversations which we had, I am very hopeful that the Governments of all these states will very shortly notify their acceptance of the scheme.

The average length of time which elapsed between the original payment of the duty and the imposition of the ""post""? It would'not be possible to answer the honourable member's questions with any degree of accuracy for the reason that the department is not in a position to know whether the duty paid in the first instance was paid in good faith , nor is it aware whether the goods in question have been sold before the extra duty is demanded. Mr R. asked the Minister representing the Minister for Markets and Migration, notice-^1.

30,Mr Watkins,"Why not quote theThe following is the judgment of the F n l l Court:The jury found a general verdict for the .plaintiffs. I should have thought myself that the evidence pointed to the conclusion that there was no definite agreement entered into between the parties on the 20th September, and that they did not intend to bind themselves until a formal agreement in writing had been prepared, but the question was one of 'fact for the jury, and they have found that the parties were bound by an agreement oni that date. Their: finding, however;, leaves its terinst uncertain. Two different contracts are alleged in the declaration, and the parol evidence of what took place between the parties does not entirely bear out either. The plaintiffs were suingon alternative claims, ancl. in the judgment it is stated that the parol evidence does not entirely bear out either. Dealing with the terms, of. the alleged contract,, the Chief Justice saidIn. my opinion, assuming tliat the contract relied upon, in the added count was the contract im. fact entered, iuto by the. parties the-, plaintiffs'' case fails upon: tlie short, ground, that there is no. inuui-oraucUnn of its terms signed by or on IielialE of the defendant sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.. If there is one thing tliat appears clearly on the. evidence it is that one of the principal reasons whyi,, throughout tlie negotiations, the plaintiffs wero unwilling toenter into at bindingcontractwith, the defendant forany specifiedquantity of bricks was because of the Targe, outstanding, orders to othercustomers to whfchthey were committed. . . . .

'omts is on the ber for Newcastle ( Mr W'atkras)"" to establish his case, and prove that the department did make any representation of the kind alleged. We know that the plaintiffs made a claim and issued a writ, and that in the courts they absolutely failed. Therefore, in the eyes of ihe law they did not establish any case. Is there evidence of any promise or of representations by the department by virtue. of which the plahrtiffs. were induced to incur certainexpenditure? The honourable member for Newcastle has not adduced any evidence of that nature. In order that the matter may be understood by the House, I shall direct attention t«» some of the evidence. The plaintiffs alleged that by virtue of certain representations by the department they were induced! to incur expemditwre in the erection of additional kilns, and that, failing to get a contract from the department, they suffered a loss. The facts are that, fo-ILowing, upcaii previous negotiations^ the department in July, 1920, again approached Dean and Sons with a view toa contract, aunt on the 20th September the result of'fehe>negotiations wasembodied in puty Commissioner.

32,Mr Watkiss,"That is not what Deanquoting the evidence given by Mr convenient to yourself. Hutchings before a judge and jury. appears that the department was willingto enter into a contract for the supply of bricks at 60s. per 1,000. but Dean and Sons intimated that they were not then prepared to make a contract on that basis, but would possibly consider ii: later. twenty-nine weeks after the agreement was drawn up in writing. Sir am quoting the sworn evidence of a witness who stated negotiations took place withina week after the 13th November. Dean knew that there was no concluded contract, for even after the date of the alleged contract, he said that when he had completed the building of his' additional kilns, and was able to increase his output, he, might consider a contract on those terms. the extra expense of bixilding the kilns with a larger quantity of bricks than in the in consequence of representations made to pleased him by the commission. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -That is existing conditions. the allegation, but it is not supported by the evidence. I shall now quote the evidence relating to the intention to build the kilns. The main question is: When was the decision to build the kilns reached? The contract was supposed to be contained in the memorandum of the 20th September, but the evidence shows that before that date Dean had decided to construct the kilns. There is no evidence that he so decided at the request of the commission. suggest that it was Dean's intention to erect these kilns apart from the contract to supply the commissioner with bricks ? Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -Thc firm was carrying on business at Newcastle. It probably saw that the commission had acquired a large area of land, arid assumed that an extensive building programme would be carried out. Negotiations had taken place with the War Service Homes Commission, and the firm took an ordinary business risk in building the kilns. In a letter written on the 11th September, nine days before the alleged contract, to the district officer of the War Service Homes Commission, Dean saidYour letter of the 7th instant has remained unanswered t ill the present, it being our intention to call on you yesterday and explain the position, which date, however, was not It Just at present we are not in a position to make any contract for the supply of a specified quantity of bricks per week, for the followingreasons:On Monday next, we start the erection of two more temporary kilns, and on completion of these it is our intention to immediately begin the building of a patent kiln. took place This will mean that for the next four or five montlis tlie bulk of the output will he required for our own work, the quanare able to put on the work. The more that those the better. Ihe present position is not satisfactory to our customers or to ourselves, for the conditions under whicli we are working make it impossible to give delivery with any certainty, and the sooner the position is improved the better from every point of view; and we regard, the matter of such importance that we think our best policy is to make the necessary developments here as speedily as possible.

Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -The negotiations do not include representations of the kind alleged. Dean that if he could make the bricks he would be doing it for the next ten years. was no undertaking by the commission to enter into a legal or binding contract. There was a series of. negotiations, similar to those that had taken place with other firms in the Commonwealth. In cross examination at the trial Dean was asked, "" Do you say that on the 11th September you had decided to build the patent kiln ?"" and he answered, ""Yes."" He confirmed that answer in subsequent cross-examination, except that he made the date a month earlier. The questions and answers were: Question -You say that on the 11th September you had arrived at that decision. How long before was it you reached that decision? Answer -Only about that time.

39,Sir Littleton Groom,"Ther eAnswer -It may have been a month before. I saw Mr Gain, and I saw Mr Hughes. I think it was the 17th August. It is obvious, therefore, that as far back as August Dean intended to extend his works, and erect the extra patent k i l n. omcers first approach Mr Dean, or did he first approach them ? Sir LITTLETONGEOOM can clear up that point for the honourable member, but even if the commissioner approached Dean, his action in doing so would only be the beginning of negotiations. It would be quite proper for the commissioner to get quotations from different firms. I have dealt with the first kiln, but there are two others in question. The letter I have read shows that Dean commenced the construction of the second k i l n about the second week in September, which was about the date that the terms and conditions of the negotiations were set down in the document. The third kil n -was started on the Sth October, and was completed by the 1st November, 1920. If those dates are correct, the decision to erect the k i l n must obviously have been reached some weeks .before. told them the number of bricks -that would be required. Nothing would have justified the erection of those kilns but an order of that magnitude. that the firm was approached by the commission did not necessarily justify it in making a claim on the department. in it . and department's requirements, and they spent money in the hope of getting the business. made by them was in September, 1920. That claim hopelessly failed, as they were unable to establish any contract in law. Not only so, but after this alleged contract had practically been set aside, they continued to supply bricks to the commission from September, 1920, to February, 1922. their claim. The contract that they endeavoured to supply of bricks at the . rate of 63s. per 1.000; but from September, 1920, to February, 1922, they supplied bricks to the commission at rates ranging from 63s. to 68s. per 1,000; the price was practically 68s. per 1,000 throughout. The company made a specific claim, and the departmental sued the department for breach of contract. A f t e r the negotiations for a contract failed in' 1920, they made. I think I no claim whatever for breach of contract, for unjust treatment, or for not receiving orders for as many bricks as' the department had said it would require. They supplied bricks upon the ordinary requisitions of J:he department, and, without express agreement, were paid at the rate of 68s. per 1,000 practically all the time from September, 1920, to February, 1922. must recollect that the price of coal and the rate of wages increased, during that period. to be remembered is that no claim that a legal contract existed was made during that period of many months. There, was not even the suggestion of a moral claim. of bricks supplied during that period? The Commissioner had number supplied was 329,000, whereas, if a contract had been entered into, the number would have been about 10,000,000. Nevertheless, no claim was made on account of short orders having been given. It was only when the firm ceased to get orders that a claim for compensation was made, in March, 1922. Twelve months later it issued a writ making a legal claim, but failed. Thosefacts show clearly that the firm had neither a legal nor a moral claim. Now, Sons were informed of the at this late stage, an attempt is made to show that the action of the firm in expending money was due to the direct The first claim representations of the department-re presentations of a character to create a moral claim. But no letter, document, or word of evidence has been cited to show that any such representations were made. The facts have been in vestigated carefully by the Crown law officers, who have advised that the firm has neither a legal nor a moral claim. have read the letters from Cook to Dean and Sons prior to September, 1920. get in 1920 was for the presentations have been quoted which would support even a moral claim.",16,Littleton Groom I Tity Depending On The Number Of Me N We

Sir LITTLET ON GEOOM -No evidence has been produced to show that the firm was induced to incur expenditure on specific representation's of the department which .have not been honoured. Honourable members will see that what happened in this case is exactly what has happened in many other cases. When business firms think that there is a prospect of big public works being undertaken, they are prepared to take risks in the hope of getting that business.. submit that tlie honourable member foilNewcastle ( Mr Watkins) has made outno case tliat would justify this House in agreeing to the -appointment of a select committee. Messrs. Dean and Sons adopted legal means to obtain their rights; they issued a writ, but the case went against them in the court. Now they are refusing to abide by the decision of the court, and are appealing to Parliacate for the department, then advised it ment in order to obtain something they could not get .otherwise. Such a claim should not be recognized by this House; to recognize this claim would establish a precedent which would have to' be followed in other similar uasBS. No (evidence has been produced to show that anything in the nature of an injustice has been done to Messrs. Dean and SOBS, and I , therefore, ask fhe House to negative the motion. Mr O'KEEFE (Denison) {3.18] -The Attorney-General said that Messrs. Dean and Sons have no moral claim. The same argument was used last session by the Minister then controlling the War Service Homes Department ( Mr Stewart), who made out jnst as strong a case in favour of the department as the Attorney General has done to-day. Buti n that instance the Minister, when he discovered, in the course of the debate, that several honourable members on the Ministerial side of the House weae of the opinion that a further investigation should be made, gave way. rraarant briefly some of the incidents concharge, of the administration of the War nected with th© case to which I have referred, because it was on all founs with out what appeared to be a very good case that now before the House. operative Estates Limited, of Tasmania, had entered into a contract with the War ServiceHomes Department to build^ near Sydney, a number of homes, or shells, under a patent concrete system. When the contract was agreed upon the manager of the company went to Sydney, where an agreement was drawn up. The War Service Homes Department advanced to the company a. sum of money for the purchase of certain plant. The agreement, while it protected the War Service Homes Department in every possible legal way, left the company without protection. For that the company was, of course, to blame. Subsequently the policy -of the War Service Homes Department was changed, and it was decided not to I proceed with the erection of these concrete homes. The department .Hiereupon called upon tiie company to refund some of the money advanced for the purchase of plant, tfhs Bum claimed being about £5,000. After much controversy the company, under protest, paid about half that sum. The Attorney-General( Sir Littleton Groom), who in this -case also is the advothat the company nad neither a legal nor a moral claim. The manager of the company, however, was so satisfied of the existence of a moral right that he spent some months in Melbourne in an endeavour to secure what he believed to be justice for his company. The aid of honourable members representing Tasmanian constituencies was enlisted on behalf of the company. After a good deal of trouble the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) consented to be interviewed by the manager. Nothing was gained from the interviews which took place, and eventually the right honourable gentleman declined to be further interviewed,saying that he was quite satisfied that the department was in the right in denying the existence of either a legal or a moral claim. The manager of the company then asked me to take up the matter. It will be remembered that I moved in this House for the appointment of a select committee to carry out a further investigation. The honourable member for It may be well to Wimmera( Mr Stewart) was then in Service Homes Department. He made The Cofor the department, but I was able to bring forward facts that appealed so strongly to several honourable members opposite that they said it was possible an iarjusticc had been done, and that a further investigation could -do no harm.",17,Littleton Groom I Tity Depending On The Number Of Me N We
53,Mr Maxwell,"To my raincl, that isAlthough the Minister had at first «mphatically declined to consent to such an investigation, claiming that it would be useless, these expressions of opinion by honourable members opposite convinced him of the wisdom of adopting a different attiopportunity to read the correspondence tude. I was prepared to allow tbe personnel of the proposed committee to be named by the Minister, and on his suggestion the Honse agreed to refer the matter to the Committee of Public Accounts. The integrity of that committee is admitted by every honourable member. When it commenced its investigation the company was threatened with ruin. The War Service Homes Department had made imperative demands for the return of the £5,000 that it had advanced against the pnirehase of plant. Approximately half of that amount was subscribed by the shareholders, and, failing to obtain the balance, the department issued a writ ""for its recovery. The other creditors of the company thereupon stepped in and submitted their claims. After a f u l l investigation tbe Committee of Public Accounts recommended that the writ should be immediately withdrawn, and the company be given a clear receipt for the balance owing. Proof is thus furnished that facts were elicited by the committee! -which were not' .within the knowledge of the Minister when he declined to allow a further investigation to be made. That case is parallel with the one that the House is how considering. WhilstI express no opinion regarding the merits of the case that was presented by the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr August, an agreement was ready for Dean Watkins), I am nevertheless loth to oppose a further investigation by am impartial tribunal. An inquiry by officials of the department could not be iunpartial, as they would naturally lean to the view that is taken by the department harm can be done by having an investigation by a select committee. Such a committee would be guided by evidence that is relevant to the matter, and it would give an impartial verdict. For that reason I intend to vote for the niotion. MT. SEABEQQK (Franklin) {3.26] I desire to make a personal explanation. The honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) asked me a fortnight a,go whether I would consent to be a member of this proposed committee. On the fatits that he placed before me I gave that consent. When the matter was discussed in the House last ThursdayI was not able to be present, but I have since had an that took place between the parties. I want honourable members to realize that no man is more anxious than I am to give every one a fair and impartial hearing. I do not excuse many of the mistakes that have been made by the War Service Homes Department. As the honourable member for Denison (Mi-. O'Keefe) has stated, it made a very grave mistake in connection with its contract with Co-operative Estates Limited. That contract, however, was quite different from this one. It was started aud finished. After the contract had heen finished, the War Service Homes Commission asked the company to build further houses. In this case no contract was ever signed. I find from the correspondence that on the 12th August, 1920, Dean did not want to make a contract. All the bricks he made were for his own customers, and he wanted to be left alone until he could get his plant extended. That clearly shows that no contract was made, and that Dean ancl Sons had no intention at that time of entering into a contract. One might suppose, as I did, when I was approached by the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins), that whilst Dean and Sons had not a legal claim, they might have a moral claim, but after reading the correspondence and the evidence in the case I am unable to see that the firm has even a moral claim. On tlie 20th and Sons. Mr Dean could agree to most of its provisions, with the exception of those providing for the delivery of the bricks and the keeping of the kilns clean. Mr Cook was prepared! at that time to No take prompt delivery. Thc department was quite prepared to accept all the bri-cki that Dean oould supply. This further shows that no agreement had been entered into, and in my view relieves the Government of even any moral -obligation to Dean and Sons. On 7th September Mr Dean made the statementJust at present we are not in a position to make any contract for a specific quantity of brides. On the completion of our orders, we .are going to build kilns. That is to say that ail the bricks tlie firm was making were to be supplied to il? own customers as the firm had agreed, and on the completion of its contract with its customers it was prepared to build new kilns. after this before the new kilns were in operation. I can find nothing in the correspondence from Dean and Sons, or in the evidence taken by the court, t.o suggest that any contract was signed, or that Dean and Sons had even a moral claim against the Government. This is a totally different casefrom that to which the honourable member for Denison( Mr Service Homes Commission were not put O'Keefe) has referred. Mr O'KEEFE -No harm can come from an impartial investigation of tlie case. satisfied that the department.was under at least a moral obligation in the matter,I would not vote for the appointment of a select committee to investigate a claim. I am sorry that I cannot support the motion, although I agreed toi act on the proposed committee. When I agreed to do so, I knew only what I was told by the honourable member for Newcastle. I have since gone through the whole of the correspondence in the case, and have changed my mind with respect to the claim. I must vote against the niotion. I certainly must disagree with the honbrook). It would appear that, so far as he is concerned, justice is to be confined to one state. have his case investigated by a select committee of this House comes from Tasmania, the honourable member will support the request for such an investigation ; but if the claimant comes from Newcastle he apparently regards it as an altogether different proposition. Personally, I do not know of two claims that stand more nearly on all fours than the claim of Dean and Sons and that which has beeu referred to by the honourable member for Denison( Mr O'Keefe). I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee that investigated the whole of the facts connected with the Tasmanian case. The files showed that certain offers were made by departmental officials which established a moral claim for the Co-operative Estates Company. I had an opportunity also of investigating with other members of the committeequite a number of war service homes cases, and the whole of the operations of the War Service Homes Commission up to a certain period. This case is exactly similar to a score of cases It was actually twelve months that cam© under my notice, where Commissioner Walker had outlined an extensive building programme, purchased areas of land, and was seaching here, there, and everywhere for people who could manufacture bricks and other buildiug material. All the communications between departmental oflicials and persons doing business with the War down in writing, and it is very difficult for a man to establish a legal claim if he has not something in writing to support it. Dean and Sons were in communiI t is wrong in. principle. cation with Mr Cook, the representative of.the War Service Homes Commissioner in Newcastle. From time to time there were conversations between Mr Dean and Mr Cook. It was brought out in evidence time after time during the inquiry into the operations of the War Service Homes Commission that promises were made by officials to contractors, and that contractors undertook to do certain work, and to extend their plants if the commission was prepared to give them very extensive contracts. The whole of these troubles originated as a result of the decision of the Government to go out of the business of building war service homes. Honourable members know how Mr Driver was persecutedI will not say prosecuted-by the War Service Homes Commission. He got a verdict If a man who claims to from a jury of his fellow-countrymen, but he was taken by the commission from court to court, and thousands of pounds were spent in the effort to defeat his verdict.

94,Mr Brennan (Batman) [ 4 . 5 ],"but even the acceptance of it is by no means a final answer to the request of the honourable member for Newcastle, nor does it debar the honourable member for Lilley from supporting the motion. The allegation is that negotiations were opened up with Henry Dean and Sons for the supply of bricks to the War Service Homes Commission. The first and most curious fact about the negotiations is that it was not Henry Dean and Sons' who sought the contract; a representative of the War Service Homes Commission was running after this brick-making firm and endeavouring to induce it to enter into a contract. The result was that some kind of inchoate agreement was made between Henry Dean and Sons and the commission, or, at any rate, Mr Cook, an officer of the commission. took onerous commitments and responsibilities, and the anticipations of business with the commission not being realized, suffered a serious loss. negotiations litigation arose, and opinions and reports were obtained from responsible omcers of the Crown. ter for Works and Railways( Mr Hill) told the House that the courts had decided that no contract existed between the War Service Homes Commission and Henry Dean and Sons, and the honourable member for Eawkner( Mr Maxwell) pertinently pointed out that the decision of the Full Court was that there was no contract enforcable at law. The contractors' claim was upset on technical grounds, and apparently, although I am not aware that this point was raised, it was held that Mr Cook had no authority to make a contract. tain statutory defects in this contract which made it unenforcable at law, and it was impossible for Henry Dean and Sons to get redress in the courts. this were a dispute between Henry Dean and Sons and, say, Robinson or Jones, private citizens, the decision of the court would have to stand, because this Parliament could not undertake to redress grievances or even obvious injustices as between private individuals. But in this instance the grievance, the injustice, and the loss suffered by Henry Dean and Sons are the result of a moral agreement with a representative of the War Service Homes Commission. the firm cannot get rodress in the courts Ur. Brennan. for an injustice done by a government instrumentality like the War Service Homes Commission, the only authority that can give redress is this Parliament, which created the commission and is responsible for its actions. there was an agreement which cannot be proved. The Crown has always denied that there was any agreement. able member will tell the House on what grounds the Crown denies the existence of an agreement. The honourable member's' interjection rather strengthens the case for an inquiry by a select committee. dealt with .the case ? jury was that there was an agreement. did not understand why the jury arrived at that decision. Out of these the judges do not understand the reasons for a jury's decision. There are many people at large who, in the opinion of The Ministhe judges, should be in jail, but, nevertheless, they cannot be re-arrested. The War Service Homes Commission was an instrument of this Parliament. It is alleged that Henry Dean and Sons have a moral claim against the commission, and that the claim, though not enforceable at law, has some moral right behind it. This is a public matter especially affecting the honour of this Parliament, for it is the duty of honourable members to see that no man who believes that he has entered into an arrangement with the Government of this country shall suffer At any rate, there were cerloss or injury through a technicality. All these considerations strengthen the case for an inquiry. The honourable member for Eawkner( Mr Maxwell) appreciates If the vital distinction between a case on the merits of which a court of law has given a decision, with which we are asked to interfere, and a case in which,_ the court not having given a clear decision on the merits, we are asked to consider the redressing of a wrong. I do not know whether a wrong has been done to Henry Dean and Sons, but I say that a prima facie case has been made out, and that this Parliament is competent to deal with it without interfering with the prerogaIf tives of the courts or violating the general",23,Littleton Groom I Tity Depending On The Number Of Me N We

100,Mr Brennan,"Very frequentlyprinciple that when a question has been decided in the courts the decision must rest there. the honourable member for Lilley( Mr definitely reached between Mr Cook and Mackay) will, on reconsideration, see that this is a case in which the holding of an inquiry would not violate the principle which is dear to him, and which I accept as rightly binding honourable members of this House. port the motion of the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) for an inquiry into the claim of Henry Dean and Sons against the War Service Homes Commission. After carefully listening to the debate I have come to the conclusion that prima facie the firm has a moral and just claim. I am not prepared to say that the claim should be granted, but it should at least be closely scrutinized by a select committee. The War Service Homes Commission was created at a time when it was proposed to provide large numbers of houses for returned soldiers. It was a new form of activity for the Government, and in a short period of time the Commissioner had to collect a staff and decide matters of administration. It is only reasonable to assume that mistakes and misunderstandings occurred. Many large schemes were outlined, huge undertakings were foreshadowed, and large estates were purchased. Two large estates were acquired in the Newcastle district, and negotiations with Henry Dean and Sons were entered into by Mr Cook, the Newcastle representative of the War Service Homes Commission, who, in a letter to the firm, wroteWe wish to assure you that our constructional programme is permanent, and that our requirements will only be mot by the receipt of 250,000 bricks per week for at least ten years. It is not the policy of the commission to acquire brickworks cr commence new works of sufficient capacity to supply the whole of our requirements. We are in a position to make an agreement with you to accept the maximum quantity of bricks for which you are in a position to guarantee delivery, say from 50,000 to 75,000 per week for three, five, -or more years. That letter clearly indicated to Henry Dean and Sons that the War Service Homes Commission intended to proceed with a large building scheme in-the district. On that the firm dislocated its business and made preparations to meet the new demand. It ceased to make pipes and tiles, and commenced the erection of I sincerely hope that extra brick, kilns. An agreement was Mr Dean on the 20th September, 1920. During the following month the War Service Homes Act was amended, and the effect of the amendment was to restrict considerably the powers of the commissioner. Comprehensive schemes that had beeu foreshadowed had to be submitted to the Minister, many projected undertakings were cancelled, and much of fhe work formerly in the hands of the Government was left to private enterprise. The Minister and many honourable members who support the Government contend that there was no contract. I do not know of the existence of a contract; but an agreement was reached. By the appointment of a select committee the facts can be inquired into, and the firm treated"" justly. Special attention should be given to tbe moral side of the claim. 1 am sure that a committee of this House would not advise anything detrimental to the interests of the Government, and would see that right and honest treatment was given to the firm. The honourable member for Newcastle, and those who support him, do not challenge the decision of the courts. A judge and jury gave a verdict in favour of Henry Dean and Sons, but the War Service Homes Commission appealed, and that and a subsequent appeal by Henry Dean and Sous went against the firm. I am not arguing this case on the basis of law. I admit that the firm has no legal claim, but if it re-arranged its business and suspended the manufacture of pipes and tiles in order to be able to execute large orders for the War Service Homes Commission, it should receive some consideration from the Government. I do not support the view of the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) and the Attorney-General( Sir Littleton Groom) that the firm took an ordinary business risk. It would not have dislocated its business and undertaken the construction of additional kilns had it not anticipated orders from the War Service Homes Commission as a result of the agreement between MrH . Dean and the representative of the commission.

102,Mr Stewart (Wimmera) [ 4 . 2 6 ],"I do not know what views you, sir, hold on this subject to-day, but it is interesting to recall the views that you then expressed. My object in making these quotations is to emphasize that the subject is by no means a new one. AlthoughI have made inquiry, I can find no record of any debate on the subject in this House later than 1905, but I am satisfied that the public generally is to-day more discontented with the working of our parliamentary system than at any other time in tbe history of this country. Under the present cabinet system the Prime Minister has autocratic and responsible powers-h e holds the resignation of every minister in the hollow of his hand; he can, and sometimes does, dismiss the whole cabinet at w ill . the democratic Labour party. The honourable member should take the most shining examples of wisdom. exceptions to the general rule, and do not intend to wander into the by-ways of the procedure adopted by the various political parties. The way in which the political machine of honourable members opposite functions is well known, but its working does not in any way destroy the case that I have put forward, namely, that the Prime Minister-whethe r a Labour Prime Minister, or otherwisecan, if he so desires, end the life of a government, and possibly of a parliament. ter who did so would remain a member of the Labour party af terwards is of no consequence in this connection. Not only has the Prime Miuister the powers to which I have referred, but in these days of obligations he speaks on behalf of tbe people of Australia; his speeches are telegraphed to all parts of the world ; and his signature is at the foot of treaties and documents involving the citizens of Australia in serious and solemn obligations. Isi t not remarkable that the individual who has these powers and responsibilities is not elected to his position by the people of Australia ? He is not even elected to that position by Parliament; his election tisually takes place behind the locked doors of the caucus meeting of the largest political party in the Parliament. That there are exceptions to that rule is shown in the case of the Parliament of Victoria, where the Premier was elected by the smallest political party in the state. the late Prime Minister of England, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald. present Treasurer. sponsibility of the Prime Minister, and the method of his election, to the manner in which the remaining members of the Cabinet are chosen. In the selection of the members of a Cabinet the deciding factors should be ability-particularl y administrative ability-and personal character. Under the party system the application of this principle would mean that the ablest members of the party would be chosen for Cabinet office; ideally applied, it would mean that the members of the Cabinet would be selected by the whole of the members who had I am not discussing been elected by the people, to represent them in Parliament. Unfortunately, under our present system, Cabinet Ministers are not always selected because of their ability. I go further, and say that they are sometimes selected because of their lack of ability, such men being more likely to be subservient to the Prime Minister who selects them. The present system requires that the members of the cabinet shall be united, indivisible, each being responsible for the action of his colleagues. Whether a Labour prime minisThey constitute, in effect, a secret junta that dominates the Parliament. They fix the date upon which Parliament shall, meet, the date upon which it shall go into recess, the sitting days, the order of business, and the nature of the business with international responsibilities and which Parliament shall deal. I have stated that administrative ability is not the sole qualification for selection for cabinet rank. Sometimes an individual is selected because of his social standing, or because he represents certain interests upon which his party are dependent for election funds. He-may even be the nominee of influential newspapers which are able to influence public opinion upon the leading questions of the day. It is the Cabinet, so appointed, which dictates the business of the House, governs the country when the Parliament is in recess, and administers the expenditure of the huge sums of public money",26,Elective Ministries

I answer ""yes"" to both of those questions. f u l ly read all the available literature on the subject, and have found a great paucity of constructive ideas for overcoming the evils of the present system. find that nearly all advocates of a change f a l l back on the Swiss system of elective ministries. quote from a work, Government in Switzerland, by Vincent, a very brief outline of the cabinet system of that country. The Cabinet is apublic body in regard to records of its proceedings. That is a striking departure from our method of secret Cabinet meetings. In Switzerland the reports of Cabinet meetings are published in the Government Gazette, and when Parliament meets, every member is handed a report of the business done by the Cabinet. cisions, as distinct from discussions? ceedings of the Cabinet are published in detail I am unable to say. The writer continuesIn Switzerland the federal cabinet is a creation of the federal legislature, and each secretary holds a separate commission. Tenure of office is not dependent on the president, but is fixed by the constitution at a definite term of years. Re-election is possible, but Leaving out of conalways at the hands of a new legislature. Practically, cabinets in America have a fixed term of four years, but in Switzerland a faithful official has a legal claim upon a three years' tenure, of which he may not be deprived The party system except by a decree of court. Hence this is not a parliamentary ministry, which vises and falls with the measures which it advocates. It is usually elected by the party of the majority, but does not feel called -upon to resign when one of its bills fails to pass. The proposal of legislation is one of the duties laid upon the council; it is expected to lead the way in making and changing federal law, but it has no autocratic monopoly of initiative even within its own party. Any member of If we thc chambers may move the adoption of a bill, but all are submitted to the council for an opinion, and must -be returned within a certain time. . . . When, however, projects urged or approved by the cabinet are rejected by the legislature, the ordinary parliamentary result does not take place. The self-respect of Ministers is not called in question, because they were elected for the very purpose of giving their honest opinion on legislative proposals, and if this opinion does not agree with that of the legislature, they prepare bills which will be acceptable. Instances are rare where Ministers resign on account of disagreement with their colleagues or with the majority, and tenure usually depends on their own will Can that be done; and, if so, in the inatter. Men who have proved capable administrators are kept in office term after I have careterm. The writer quotes various names and long periods of office, up to 30 years in extent, I in illustration of this pointThis long tenure has been partly due to the fact that the same party, or some shade of it, ill as been in power most of tlie time; but I may be pardoned if I parties have not always upheld the projects of their own Ministers, and yet when their terms expired have given tlie men a re-election.

The conditions in Switzerland differ in m a n y ways from those in Australia, and I do not think that the Swiss system in its entirety could be applied successfully to Australia. I have a proposal which I submit for the consideration of honourable members, and which, whether they agree with it or not, is at any rate a constructive proposal, and is submitted for what it is worth. I believe that the present system of Cabinet responsibility should be abolished, and that the Cabinet in the main should be an administrative body. The Cabinet should have less power, and the Parliament as a body should possess the real power. Parliament should not, as under our system, create a body having greater powers than it possesses itself. The' Cabinet should contain a proportionate representation of all the members in the Parliament. "" hotch-potch."" term "" hotch-potch "" applied to such a body before. mendation apply even where parties are separated by fundamental differences? a small way adopted this principle in this Parliament in the appointment of two permanent committees-the Public Works Committee and the Public Accounts Committee. The unwritten law is that there shall be proportional representation of the various parties on those committees. When Minister for Works and Railways .1 came into close contact with the decisions pf the Public Works Committee, and frequently had occasion to respect and be guided by them. these permanent committees, although they are strongly partisan in the House, do excellent work on the committees. During the last few years, I venture to say that it is no exaggeration to claim that the Public Works Committee, this so-called has saved millions of public money by its recommendations. MrE . RILEY -The committee is not run on party lines. that the Cabinet should be run on party lines. To show what the position would be, were my recommendation adopted, let Consequently the me say that the usual argument against it is that, with strongly divergent views in the Cabinet, chaos would result and parliamentary government would be impossible. Whilst there is some logic in that contention, I think the difficulty might be largely .overcome by the appointment of a greater number of permanent committees to deal with specific subjects. I shall give an example of one such committee that might be appointed, and that is a defence committee. I believe that the machinery of government might be improved by the appointment of a permanent defence committee, based, as our existing permanent committees are based, on the proportionate representation of all parties. The committee should be required to deal with all questions of defence. I quite recognize that it would be impossible, with a cabinet composed as I have suggested, to agree upon a defence policy. It might agree that a defence policy was necessary and should be defined, but, when it came to define it , differences of opinion would arise. All that the Cabinet need do is to declare, that a defence policy is necessary, and W o u l d your recomthen refer the matter by resolution of Parliament to the defence committee for inquiry and report. The committee could take evideuce from admirals, generals, and officers of the Army, Navy, and A i r Force, could inspect bases, ships, and fortifications, and make such other inquiries as it thought fit, and then submit to Parliament a definite and concrete proposal for a defence programme. Taking the worse possible view of the matter for the purpose of my argument, I assume that the M in ister for Defence is personally opposed to the recommendations of the defence comMembers cf mission. The Parliament would order a bill to be drafted on the lines profiosed by the majority of the defence committee. It would be presented to Parliament, and I again assume that the Ministeri n charge of it would be against its provisions. Let me assume, for instance, that "" hotch-potch"" committee, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) is the Minister for*. Defence, and that the majority of the defence committee is composed of members from this side of the House.

He might state plainly that he was against the whole bill or against some of its provisions. dnty as the Minister concerned to explain the measure fairly and impartially to the House, and in concluding his observations might reiterate his intention to vote against all or some of the recommendations of the defence committee. But, if carried, it would be his duty to administer the act as passed by the Parliament. That would be a much more sensible procedure than the present method of dealing w i th such a measure. _ Under the present system a Cabinet Minister opposed to a measure puts up a fight against it in Cabinet. there, he comes into this House and advocates and votes for something to which he is perhaps utterly opposed. In other words, he must bow to the principle of Cabinet solidarity and responsibility, or vacate his office. such a system as I suggest would be that each party would select its ablest administrators for office, knowing well that they would have to compete against able rivals in other parties. Y o u could obtain Ministers of higher calibre from the whole of the Parliament than by confining the selection to a party. present in this and every other Parliament following the same system, we have the spectacle of able administrators sitting idly upon the Opposition benches. The country is deprived of their talents and services, and they exercise their ability, not in governing the country, but in endeavouring governing it . Such a system as I suggest would put an end to the present policy of governments endeavouring to secure favour at elections by the manipulation of taxation and by making proposals to obtain favours for certain classes to whom they look for support. about ? been done in this Parliament, and if this Government does not do it at the next elections it w ill be the first in the history of this country that has refrained from doing so. vernment to do quite a lot of things. criticizing the Government as a governThe present parliamentary procedure is ment, but merely combating the honourable member's interjection.

It frequently happens that an honourable member votes against his convictions for the sake of his party. Take the case of the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister). Last session, he vigorously attacked the Government One advantage of for letting a naval contract for serge cloth overseas instead of to some very admirable firm in Geelong. The honourable member said that the Government for its action was deserving of the most severe censure. The honourable member for Bourke( Mr. Anstey), ever ready to secure a party adAt vantage, sympathized with him , and moved a motion of censure against the Government, which the honourable member for Corio voted against.

Is it necessary that when a member of the Tasmanian Parliament, occupied this singular position, and I have no doubt that his strong and fearless attitude on all questions to the government One of the greatest evils of the present parliamentary system is that the floor of Parliament is, in effect, a battleground upon which advocates of the various political parties spend most of their time fighting for merely party advantage. Parliament itself, with the growth of secret party meetings, is more often than not a chamber to record publicly decisions that have been arrived at behind the locked doors of caucus meetings. Each Government of the day spends most of its time fighting for its existence against the attacks of the Opposition, instead of administering the affairs of the country. member can ignore these facts. It is all very well for us to say that Parliament is what the people make it; that the people get the kind of government they deserve. The people look to their representatives in Parliament for good government, and if the parliamentary forms and procedure are so antiquated and cumbersome as to render good government difficult or even impossible, then the people have a right to ilook to members of Parliament to change the parliamentary machine, and render good government possible of accomplishment. changed not by the people, but by us. There are no constitutional difficulties in the way. This Parliament could change its present system in 24 hours, or if considered necessary, this afternoon. I quite recognize the danger of sudden and violent changes in parliamentary systems of government. I well appreciate the point so eloquently stressed by the honourable member for Eawkner( Mr Maxwell) during a recent debate,the value of clinging fast to the old; but I submit Mr Stewart. that we have too long clung to the present parliamentary system. We It enables a are not trying to improve it. As a Oommonwealth and a nation, we have machine, a condition led the way in industrial and other legislation. Surely we can lead the way in changing the procedure in Parliament, and substituting in its stead a system I understand that the honourable that will be a model for the whole we should cling to the present system simply because it is the system of the Mother Country? There is no getting away from the fact that gave grave concern Parliament and parliamentary members of the day. are not held by the people outside in the esteem and respect that they deserve. This position is brought about, not because honourable members as a body are not sincere in their desire to govern the country properly, but because as new members they come here and are confused and disconcerted by the forms of Parliament. They naturally endeavour to learn these forms, and in learning them become accustomed to them, and then drift along with the tide. honourable member desire under that system ? No honourable honourable member has made that interjection, but, at any rate, it gives me the opportunity of saying that I cannot well be charged with a violent desire for office, or with being ready to sink principle to obtain or retain office. I find in reading past debates that nearly all advocates of this system have been twitted with the same unworthy motive. Under the system I am proposing, the representation in the Cabinet of the party to which I belong would be two, instead of five as at present, and if I desired to obtain office-and I do uot desire it-m y chances would be less It can be under that system than they are to-day. That. I think, is an effective answer to the honourable member's interjection. T am glad to have had the opportunity of moving and discussing this motion.

I do not think that honourable members can doubt the accuracy of the first paragraph of the motion. In five of the six states Labour governments are in power; and i u two of them, New South Wales and South Australia, the state parliaments have passed resolutions protesting against their citizens being recommended for titles. I have not the slightest doubt that the parliaments in the three other states governed by Labour w ill soon come to a similar decision.' In the Victorian Parliament the Government and the Opposition are f a i r l y even, and I suppose that opinion upon the subject of titles is f a i r l y well balanced. rate it is reasonable to assume that the opinion of the state parliaments is overwhelmingly against the further granting of titles, but the Commonwealth Government is able to over-ride that sentiment.

That case illustrated the present anomalous system by which the Commonwealth Government may recommend individuals for honours, despite the opposition of the parliament of the state of which they are citizens. The whole treud of AusI ralian sentiment is against the conferring of these titles, and it is time that this Parliament stepped into line with the Parliaments of Canada and SouthA f r i c a . I find that inboth those dominions members were practically unanimous in declaring that none of their citizens sliould be recommended for titles, and, accordingly, the debates on the subject were very brief. Their attitude is easily understood. There has been so much corruption in connection with the obtaining of titles that they are no longer honourable distinctions. Quite recently, a Tory Government in Great Britain appointed a royal commission to inquire into the alleged sale of titles, and that body, upon OF TITLES. which the radical representatives were certainly not in the majority, reportedThere is no doubt that there has been for some time recently an increasing number of persons who, for want of a better name we going about asserting that they were in a position to secure honours and titles in return for specified payments. That report by a representative commission confirmed the belief of a good many people that titles are granted, not in recognition of public service, but in return for monetary contributions to the party in power. An eminent scientist, who is engaged in work for the benefit of the community, is not prompted by any expectations of a t it l e ; he is animated merely by his enthusiastic interest in science, and his humanitarian zeal. A case of the opposite nature is that of Sir Lionel Robinson, of South Africa. W it h out the British Attorney-General, or the Colonial Secretary, or the Premier of the state of which Sir Lionel Robinson was A t any a citizen having been consulted, that gentleman was recommended to the .King for elevation to the peerage. But the intention of the Government was disclosed, and so strong was the public outcry against the ennobling of Sir Lionel Robinson, that the Government was compelled to withdraw his name from the honour list. During the war, one man who was made a peer of the realm deserted Great Britain a few months later, because he objected to paying the war-time profits tax. The class of men upon whom honours have been bestowed in recent years has created a suspicion that titles are no longer the reward of talent, but are the perquisites of men with long purses. Peerages were at one time openly hawked about. JamesI . of England charged £1,000 for a baronetcy. I do not know how much (hose honourable members paid who have a knighthood, but I understand that some fee is charged. History tells us that Charles II . did not charge for peerages, but that he ""made duchesses of those whose pretty faces pleased h i m, and children of doubtful parentage are still foisted on the peerage, and draw incomes from the public estate."" There are titles like those of the Duke, of Grafton and the Duke of St. Albans still in existence, which had their origin in the shameful issue of a profligate king and doubtful characters.

134,Mr Mcgrath (Ballarat) [ 5 . 3 7 ],"I should consider it a doubtful honour to those whose ancestors obtained titles hundreds of years ago by methods that will not bear investigation. It is surprising how many titles there are in Australia. On the cover of HansardI find ""Donald Charles Cameron, C.M.G., D.S.O."" Those are military distinctions, but we know that the "" D.S.O."" was not given solely for gallant services at the front.

Question so resolved in the can at least be said of a ENFORCEMENT OF move That, in the opinion of this House, means should be provided for the effective enforcement of all the laws which Parliament places or allows to remain upon the statute'book, and that, as a general rule, such enforcement should not be left to the initiative of interested parties: in particular, that officers should be appointed for the purpose of making necessary inspections and inquiries for the purpose of securing the observance by all parties of awards or the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and of enforcing the provisions of the Commonwealth; Conciliation and Arbitration Act. My mind was brought to this subject more particularly by reason of what occurred in , I think, January last, when the general president of the Seamen's Union was prosecuted for inciting persons to strike, or for some offence of that nature. A t the time very strong protests were made by the friends and associates of that gentleman, because, as action of .. .. 36 that kind had not previously been taken, it .. .. . . 26 was felt that the prosecution was a political one. It is unfortunate that the enforce10 ment of the law should have been allowed to get into such a condition that there was room for the genuine belief, on the Mackay, G.

On receipt of the complaint, an inspector ascertains the facts, and, if the officer administering the act thinks proper, a prosecution is instituted. That is done in a regular, automatic way, without any personal feeling, or any one being concerned politically. It is done in -exactly, the same way as the ordinary laws are enforced by the police. If two citizens are found drunken and disorderly, they are usually arrested, and, later, brought before a magistrate, without there being any suggestion that the enforcement of the law in their case is part of a political scheme. «If we are to place, as the Commonwealth has sought to place, industrial relations largely upon the legal plane, the law should be enforced in the same regular, automatic, and non-partisan manner as other legislation. well known to all who in ""any way have concerned themselves with the history of industrial legislation that the early Factories Acts passed in the beginning of the nineteenth century, and, indeed, most of the factories legislation passed up to almost the middle of that century, failed in effect because the enforcement bf the law was left to private persons. evidence of that in the writings of Sidney and Beatrice Webb, in The Town Labourer, by J .

There are, for example, the provisions of sections 6 and 6A of the Arbitration Act, which prohibit strikes and lockouts. Honourable members know that those provisions are very largely a. It is dead letter. I am not now concerning myself with the merits of any particular dispute, and do not want this important matter to be side-tracked than by any discussion of that nature. I am well aware that what, ' from one point of view, is regarded as a strike, from another point of view is regarded as a lockout. It is, however, perfectly, plain, that there have been many stoppages of industries due either to strikes or lockouts, and the law has not been put into force, but, on the contrary has, in general, been ignored. I shall not debate the effect which that has had upon the parties interested. It is fundamentally an error to allow to remain on the statute-book laws which Parliament, or the executive, is afraid, or is not able to enforce. It . is a matter for very grave consideration whether there should be legislation in general terms against strikes. While the law remains as it is, I suggest that it is the duty of Parliament to see that it is administered. TheI t is present position should not be allowed to continue, because, when action. is taken under a certain law, the result is an exacerbation of feeling, and a kindling of intense resentment, which would be absent if Parliament saw that its laws Were regularly enforced. Mr O'KEEFE -Was not a law passed a few years ago for dealing' with combines ? example of legislation that has not been enforced. It is known as the Anti-Trust Act, but its title is the Australian Industries Preservation Act. Only one prosecution was instituted under it , and that prosecution failed.

If it is discovered that it is difficult or impossible to enforce them, Parliament is given the best guidance to useful amendment or .repeal. is connected with that respect for law upon which the existence of our parliamentary institutions, and our social system generally, depends. I , therefore, ask honourable members to affirm the general principle which I have expressed. I do not think that my proposal involves the setting up of an extensive or expensive department. There would heed to be in each state an inspector or two to whom complaints could be made, and they would investigate and report to head-quarters in important cases. My idea is to remove the administration of an important branch of our law from the suspicion of being connected with the political exigencies of. a particular government or % particular time. Mr O'KEEFE -Does the honourable member propose that such a staff should move on its own initiative when it believes that the law is being broken, or that it should wait for the government to move ? move on its own initiative as well as when it is moved officially. Onlyi n that way can we make real some of our legislation, particularly our industrial legislation. I can see no objection to the appointment of a staff to put the law into execution. I do not mean that there should be a permanent set of inquisitors. That would be unnecessary. But there should be officers who would be empowered to see that Commonwealth legislation was being obeyed in all cases where it applied. I have said that the principle applies with equal force to the laws relating to trusts, combines, and monopolies. That law is at present in a condition of quiescence. We all know that one source of very grave and intense feeling amongst the community to-day is the suspicion of being the victim of trusts and combines. book a law which is very severe in its terms-so severe, probably, that it overreaches itself-and yet no steps are being taken to enforce its provisions. states seem to believe that all matters relating to trusts, combines, and monopolies come solely within the scope of the Commonwealth Government. They do not. The majority of the alleged trusts, combines, and monopolies which are said to be unduly raising the prices of commodities, are operating within the limits of a single state, and it is within the This subject power of the parliaments of the states concerned to control them. It is, of course, convenient for the states to suggest that the Commonwealth should look after the matter. The Commonwealth, however, can deal with such trusts, combines, and monopolies only when they affect interstate and foreign trade. It is for this Parliament to see that that law, equally with other laws, is enforced. Eveni f an attempt to enforce it fails, advantages will be gained. If it were proved that an alleged trust, which was charged with operating to. the detriment of the public, was not so operating, the mind of the community would be more satisfied than it is at the present time, when nothing is being done.

147,Mr Nelson (Northern T E R R I T O R Y ),"been reminded that I should not use my privileged position as a member of this House to make unmerited attacks on officials who are not in a position to defend themselves. I agree with that, because I am one who believes in fair play, though I have not always myself received it . Apparently honourable members supporting the Government think that this is a principle which should be applied, very strictly in the case of officers and other persons in comfortable and assured positions, but somewhat laxly in the case of non-commissiontsd officers, and particularly in the case of industrial advocates, or, let me say, in the case of one who advocates the interests of the pioneers of the Northern Territory. I should like td place before the House a few interesting items for the purpose of demonstrating the inconsistency of honourable members opposite in the attitude they have adopted towards me. I have here a letter which I received a few days agoMr Nelson, M.H.R. Dear Mr Nelson, Last year, Bruce and Pearce, with the protection of parliamentary privilege, oast very serious reflections ori my character to bolster up the awful state of affairs in the maladministered Territory of New Guinea. These two politicians said on the floor of the House that Begley was non compos mentis, a dipsomaniac, and a religious maniac. Every utterance they made as to myself is of a most wicked nature, as many of the leading medical men will tell you-damnabl e lies. I am a returned soldier, and according to my war pension, I am 40 per cent incapacitated, but the Returned Soldiers Imperial League never had a word to say when Bruce and Pearce attacked me. Perhaps Major Story is one who supports the interests of Pearce and Co. WhatI desire to say in connection with this letter is that the writer is a returned soldier, and was wilfully maligned on the floor of this House. Some of the most vile statements that could be concocted were made against him. It was said that he was non compos mentis, .a dipsomaniac, and a religious maniac. sented some of the best medical certificates obtainable in Australia to show that he was perfectly sane, but I did not see honourable members opposite jumping up to defend his honour. What was the reason? Obviously, that he was not an officer. H ad be been an officer I have -no doubt that he would have found many honourable members on the other side to defend him . He was w i l f u l l y maligned, and yet no apology was ever given, although the statements made concerning him were proved, as he says, to be absolutely unfounded. My statements, to which exception has been taken, differed from those which were made concerning this man. I claim that any statements I make have some substantial basis, bul that could not be said of the statements made concerning the man to whom I have referred. Then, let me cite the case of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates), which must be fresh in the minds of honourable members. He was maligned on the floor of this House on crook evidence faked by one of the departmental officials. The honourable member lost his seat because of that faked evidence. Honourable members are aware of the result of a subsequent inquiry into his case. How niany honourable members ou the other side rose to defend him? quiry. it was forced upon them by honourable members on this side. I have mentioned the cases of two men who were not officers, It seems to be the rule that so long as a man is not an officer an honourable member may stand up here and malign h i m for all he is worth, and it is quite all right. If he happens fo be an officer, and particularly one holding a government aud a responsible position, immunity is claimed for him, and he must not be attacked under the privilege of this House. If this last is the correct attitude to assume, all I ask is that honourable members opposite should apply it in all cases, whether the person referred to is a ranker or an officer. I should like to ((note the following from the Argus of the 10th January, 1920:Brigadier-General G. H. Jess has deferred the promulgation of sentence on Lieutenant H. G.

If it takes to itself the liberty of publishing these things, surely the press has no right to chastise a man who quotes it as his authority for repeating statements it has published.

When they put up these "" Aunt Sallies,"" so far as I am concerned, tbey are free to knock them over as often as they like. I quote now the official record of General McNicdl's minute, dated 15th June, 1917: Headquarters Tent, A.I.F., 37th Battalion. Referring to minute, please inform Major Story that his action in ordering the withdrawal of the 37th Battalion from the green line on 7th June is considered unsound. Major Story has already been informed personally by me of the decision of the Divisional Commander, namely, that for the present he will not be considered for any higher command than that of a company commander. The promotion of Captain Rolleston to the rank of major has been recommended. His appointment to be second in command of your battalion will be approved and may be anticipated by you. I tender that minute in order that it may be placed side by side with the letter from General McNicol read by the Honorary Minister. It is significant that Major Rolleston, who was junior to Major Story, was placed second in command. If the Minister searches the file he will find that Major Story complains bitterly about being superseded by a junior officer. I could fill volumes of I quote also Hansard with this sort of stuff in support of what I have said, but for the present I leave the matter at that. I consider that public officials and members of Parliament must be prepared to stand up to criticism, and in the short I have often heard very strong cases made out by honourable members against officials in the various departments, and rightly so, because the honest administration of the country's affairs in the f u l l light of day is more important than the feelings of the individual.

Thab is my first sin against Heaven and the officer class. As I am not to be believed, I shall not at this stage say whether I am right or wrong.

153,Mr Nelson,"I said nothing of themade, """"Why was M a j o r Story sent home ?"" I answered, "" Because of the manner in whicli he behaved himself under fire."" Major Story was a coward. On the 25th September, 191S, instructions were given for Story to proceed to Australia, and the Melbourne office was accordingly notified. On tbe 5th October, 1918, instructions were issued to Major Story at Havre, France, ancl the London office was also notified that M a j o r Story would embark that day. I want to be f a i r in my interpretation of the reports on the file. It is evident that M a j o r Story was not aware that the m i l it a ry heads had ordered h i m to be returned to Australia for discharge, because at that time be wrote asking head-quarters to appoint h i m as a senior major to a Victorian in f a n t r y battalion other than in the 10th Australian In fantry Brigade, aud preferably to one of the battalions in the 15th Australian In f a n t r y Brigade. The astounding part is that the filing oflice on the 28th September, when inquiries were made about Major Story, stated that no papers had been received, yet some of these reports had been written on the 17th September! On the 2nd October, 1918, M a j o r Story submits a humble and sincere apology for his action and statements. apology was minuted on the same date ns when M a j o r Story was under instructions to return to Australia. Matters remained quiet u n t i l the 17th October, 1918, when inquiries were made to ascertain if Major Story's application for service in another battalion, had been considered. la ten:, a letter was sent to retain Major Story, pending further instructions. On the same date General Monash. wired from England: Am prepared to accept Major -Story else1918. I have already read his remarks, where than 10th Battalion, provided lie disand tbey are even more to the point than posed to render loyal service. On the 26th November, 193 S, M a j o r Story was sent across to j o in the 8th Battalion. The Ministerf o r Defence admitted that this officer temporarily commanded the 37th Battalion from the 11th August to the 33th September. Such is the tenderness between m i l it a r y officers, that Major Story seemed for the time being to have been forgiven. He was given a second chance provided that he was disposed to i'ender loyal service. As the Minister stated, the 37th Battalion was chosen for disbandment. We are not told why, but we arc entitled to guess. I did not say that M a j o r Story wrote a letter, which the Ministerf o r Defence said was "" a bit over the fence,"" but the material question is, what was said by Monash, Gellibrand, Townsend, Dodds, and Birdwood? Major-General Gellibrand wrote on 15th September, 1918I do not think that any clearer proof of Story's incapacity could Vie given than the statement put forward in this letter. I have, therefore, suspended him from his command, and request that he be sent to the Australian Base depot pending the decision as to his final disposal. On the 17th September, the corps commander endorsed that view, and saidIn view of his actions and the tone of his letter, I consider it undesirable to post him. to any battalion in the field, and recommend that he be returned to Australia, and his services dispensed with. That must appeal to honourable members as very significant. A re-organization of the Australian troops was taking place. The officer commanding the battalion wished to find a post for M a j o r Story, but although the A r m y was short of majors it was not thought desirable to post Major Story to a battalion in the field, The and he was recommended to be returned to Australia. The Minister for Defence said that this officer had committed a merely technical breach. I submit to the House that if that was his only offence he was harshly treated by the military authorities, when, although the A r m y needed majors, they ordered h i m to be sent back On the 23rd October, sixdays to Australia to be discharged. I said in my previous speech that M a j o r Story was practically cashiered from the Army. That is very similar to what. Sir John Monash recommended on 20th September, the statement. I made. The Assistant Minister( MrM a r r ) said that on one occasion M a j or Story was held to have committed an. error of judgment, and the Ministerf o r Defence said that the letter he wrote was a little ""over the fence."" I have culled the facts from the files, and placed them before the House, and I leave it to honourable members and the country to say whether the Ministerf o r",41,William Ramsay Mcnicol

155,Mr Nelson,"Defence was right, and Monash, Gellibrand, and I were wrong. that Major Story, being an officer, and able to bring influence to bear, was forgiven and sent back to the field, but a condition was imposed, ""provided he is disposed to render loyal service."" said also that he had been court martialledI did not say that he was convicted-and I submit this evidence in support of my statement. On tbe 31st December, 1919, instructions were issued for certain prisoners to proceed to Trance for a court martial. out the president and members of the Tribunal, the prosecutor, and the prisoners' friends. The prisoners mentioned are M a j o r 0. B . Story, and Lieutenant H . G. Harris, who were then at Head-quarters awaiting embarkation. According to the charge-sheet, Major Story was charged withConduct to tlic prejudice of good order and military discipline, in that he, at delousing camp, Australian Base Depot, Havre, on or about the 14th June, 1919, improperly authorized the sale of certain Australian Comforts Fund goods when he was not entitled to do so. Then follows a summary of the evidence and the names of the witnesses for the prosecution. ing on the case is this letter, dated the 31st December, 1920Lieut. H. G. Harris, 12th Battalion, A.I.F., Major C. B. Story, 8th Battalion, A.I.F. Major StoryThe evidence submitted in this case is not strong, depending almost entirely upon the evidence of Lieut. Harris, but is sufficient, I think, to justify trial of the accused upon the charges submitted under section 40 as now amended in red pencil. The file does not show what the amended charge wasIn view of the fact tliat Lieutenant Harris is also accused of offences in connection with the disposal of Australian Comforts Fund goods,. &c, I am of opinion that his trial should be completed before Major Story is brought to trial. Ou the bottom of that page is this minute, dated the 16th January, 1920:As there is no evidence to substantiate any of the statements of Lieutenant Harris, but, on the contrary, there is evidence to disprove same, there is no charge against Major Story, who is to be at once relieved from custody. He had been in custody from the 23rd December, 1919, to the 2nd January, 1920. nexion with this charge. One, O'Neill, who apparently was resident in France, It is true admitted, when interrogated by the in vestigating officers, that he had purchased five billiard tables from Story. O'Neill said he knew Story well because he (Story) used to visit his (O'Neill's) house, I but finally he refused to give any evidence against him. I submit that had the authorities been desirous of ascertaining the truth or otherwise of O'Neill's statement they could have had recourse to another tribunal, which would have forced him to disclose from whom be had purchased the The document set tables. No such action was taken, and the charge against Story collapsed. So much for my statement that he had been court martialled. did not say that he had been discharged. of the facts on the file. Honourable members will see that every allegation I made against Story is justified by the records, and, judging from appearances, nothing detrimental was inserted therein that could be left out. I do not suggest that the Minister for Defence held back anything from me; on the contrary, he was very courteous, and gave me all the assistance possible. Nevertheless, many things are missing from the file. For instance, The next document bearI know that after the Messines engagement, the officers of the 37th Battalion made written statements, but there is no trace of them, or of the amended charge against Storyi n regard to the sale of goods belonging to the Australian Comforts Fund. I admit that my statements were inaccurate in certain slight details, and I frankly regret those inaccuracies. The Minister for Defence said that I charged Story with theft and want of courage. As a matter of fact, I charged him with neither of those failings, as honourable members may see by referring to the Hansard report of my speech. The Honorary Minister( MrM a r r ) , in his statements about me was, if possible, more inaccurate than his colleague, but I do not ask either him or the Minister for Defence to apologize. They jumped in eagerly to support one of their caste and class, but their enthusiasm outran their knowledge. Had they gone more carefully into this matter, they might not have been so hasty. M v only regret is that Story and his friends have made it necessary for me to disclose There was other evidence in conall these facts.

I repeat that to any one who reads them the words of the honourable member for the Northern Territory must suggest that Major Story was relieved of his command because he was guilty of cowardice while under fire. what occurred at the Battle of Messines. Major Story was then in command, not of a battalion, but only of a company. He was given as his objective tbe "" green line,"" which ho was told to take. The 'line was not taken, and at a subsequent inquiry the conclusion was reached that he had not shown proper judgment. Because of that decision the honourable member for the Northern Territory considered himself justified in making his accusation against him. It is very clear that the honourable member was' not at the war; had he been there he would not have made the accusation. any returned soldier on the Opposition side to say how many men there were who committed most hideous errors of judgment in the circumstances in which they were placed. had not slept for two or three weeks, day or night, whose nerves were in such a state that they did not know what they were doing, of course committed errors of judgment, and for those errors were censured; but would any decent man in the community bring those errors up Against them now in the contemptible way adopted by the honourable member for the Northern Territory? tried to blast-this officer's career because of a possible error of judgment in circumstances of which he and his kind have not the faintest conception, and took extraordinary good care that they should not experience. stated in the clearest possible way by the Ministerf o r Defence, who did not sug.gest that this officer was not told after the battle that he had not shown good judgment. Buti t was one thing for that to happen and a very different thing to accuse this man of want of physical It can courage, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory has seen fit to do. He hag not added one new fact to-night to what he said previously; but, perhaps, .he thought that by continuing I shall not refer to the long enough he would deceive member? of this House. The Minister for Defence read what finally happened, bul the honourable member followed the case from the battalion to the brigade, from the brigade to the division, from the division to the army corps, and from the army corps to the general officer commanding. Is there any one who was a) the war who does not know that communications had to go through those Let us inquire into channels, and that at every stage the statements were repeated as they were passsd on to the higher command? That wa3 the sum total of what the honourable member had to say about this episode at Messines. He said that he had not accused Major Story of physical cowardice, but I ask the House to judge what his words mean. He has not said one word in justification of his previous statements, but has read something written by General McNicoll-somethin g that accounts for nothing, and means nothing. ber read it from the file.

C SlsJll G1* C cl legal friend, who w ill descend to any quibble. Northern Territory has tried this evening, quite unsuccessfully, to explain what he meant. He has told us that he said that Major Story was practically cashiered out of the Army. He told us, too, that his statement was that this officer was court martialled, and not that he was found guilty. What does any one believe is meant when he hears only that a man has been court martialled? Does he believe that the person was acquitted by the court martial, or that he was court martialled and convicted, and deserves the contempt of every decent man? The honourable gentleman, having said that M a j or Story was "" practically cashiered out of the A r m y ,"" addedSubsequently, because of some big "" p u l l "" which he possessed, he received employment in the de-lousing dep6i, and, later, with the Bn. Comforts Fund Department, where he was again court martialled for selling to French civilians goods belonging to the comforts fund. I ask any honourable man if he can read into that statement anything other than that this officer was court martialled and convicted because he sold goods belonging to the comforts fund . It can have no other meaning. Yet the honourable gentleman contends that he said nothing as to Major Story's conviction, that he only stated that he was court martialled. To try to j u s t if y his statement in that way is a contemptible subterfuge. The honourable gentleman has talked to us in a way that has almost made us sick. The facts connected with this episode were all given by the Ministerf o r Defence, who made it perfectly clear that M a j or Story, together with Lieutenant Harris, was accused of having sold goods from the comforts fund , and that both were to be court martialled, but before the court martial the papers were, gone through and the evidence carefully examined. The honourable member for the Northern Territory read out the list of the witnesses who were to be called, and the charges He would have taken a more that were to be l a i d ; but he did not explain that, subsequently, the charges against M a j or Story were withdrawn, that he was relieved of any responsibility for He said that Major Story the wrongful sale of the goods, and was released from custody.

There was not a word of that from the honourable gentleman's lips, showing jjlearly that he deliberately attempted to create a false impression Let me recite the facts.

The episode to which I am now about rity were being forced to take because of to refer occurred a little before the signing of the armistice in November, 1918. Major Story did get at loggerheads with his official superiors in the Army. I am somewhat surprised to find the honourable gentleman from the Northern Territory complaining that this officer was at variance with those set in authority over him. One would have regarded it as the more natural thing for the honourable gentleman to agree with any one who attempted to defy his superior officers.

Major Story undoubtedly got into trouble because of that action; but the honourable member for the Northern Territory contemptibly associated that fact with his conduct when under fire at the battle of Messines, by saying that Major Story was practically cashiered out of the Army. would, I think, fai l any one to express his opinion of a man who could not only make such a charge, but afterwards try to justify it, instead of having the manliness to say that he had made a mistake which he deeply regretted, and that he would do whatever lay in his power to remove the stigma which he had placed upon an officer who, in the hour of his country's from him. The reason I have risen need, did his best and played a part of which any man might be proud. The honourable gentleman took no such course. I cannot adequately express my regret that he did not see his way to take what I am sure every man in this House believes would have been the proper course for him to take, namely, the withdrawal of his charges, and did not apologize for the wrong that he has done. stampeded into any such course by the the war period, and I have only too vivid honourable gentleman's remarks. man has failed to take the honourable were in the slightest degree out of harcourse, and I leave the country to judge mony with those held by the members of him.

Had he been candid the PrimeM in ister would have admitted that General McNicol was sent, not only the speeches of the honourable member for the Northern Territory, but also those of the Honorary Minister( MrM a r r ) , and the Minister for Defence( Sir Neville Howse), in which were made the statements regarding the courage of Major Story. -were the only speeches in which such statements were made. able member that the speech of Sir Neville Howse was made on the 1st July, whereas General McNicol's letter is dated 30th June. speech of the Honorary Minister? the Prime Minister anything to say on that point ? He told us that the only thing against Major Story was that it had been said of him that he had been guilty of an error of judgment. record speaks for itself. member for the Northern Territory said to-night, "" If I am not to be believed, I shall rely upon quotations from responsible officers."" He quoted the opinion of Major-General Gellibrand, who said that this officer should be sent to Australia and dismissed from the forces. He quoted Sir John Monash's concurrence in that suggestion. He quoted Bri gadier-General Dodd and other high military officers to the same effect. Yeti n the face of these declarations, to which every honourable member listened, the Prime Minister said that the statements of the honourable member for the Northern Territory were false in every particular He read from the file which and in every regard ! It is very hard to listen with patience to a declaration of that kind. It is exceedingly hard for me, because I know that it suits honourable members opposite-and it is not the first time that they have done it-to inflame the anger of persons and organizations outside against honourable members on this side of the House for expressing the views that they hold and delivering the message that is in them. How did this question originate ? AgainI impress it upon honourable members that I do not propose to pass judgment upon Major Story. That is not my grievance, and I would rather do Major Story a good turn than a bad one. 1 listened to the honourable member for the Northern Territory. I can truthfully say that, my experience of him leads me to believe that we have not had in this chamber a more fair-minded and honest debater. This question originated in a complaint by him regarding the administration of the Northern Territory, including a criticism of the Government Secretary. On more than one occasion in this chamber he has They complained that he could get neither redress nor even a serious answer to his complaints regarding maladministration in the Northern Territory. Finally he said I point out to the honorto himself, "" I shall arrest attention by expressing my view, which is. that Major Story is a man who had a faculty for getting into trouble in the army, who was criticized by his superior officers, who W h a t about the was nearly cashiered out of the army, who Has got into trouble regarding stores, was charged, and narrowly escaped a court martial.

182,Mr Hurry (Bendigo) [ 9 . 3 0 ],"I seelie has endeavoured to raise in this House. WhatI said was that the charge made against Major Story by the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) practically amounts to a charge of cowardice and theft. I see no reason to withdraw that. As the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) has gone fully into the matter, I need not say much more about it. But I should like very much to know what an ordinary jury outside would say of the charges made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory if they were brought to an action for slander. that the honourable member for Batman would be only too glad to take up a case of that kind. He knows very well that if the statements made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory inside fhis House were made outside of it, the honourable member would have a good chance of forfeiting a good deal of his salary of £1,000 a year. game, let him repeat his statements outside, and let Major Story have a "" g o "" at him, and he will find that his statements will cost him a great deal. In regard to the first charge, I gave the House my assurance with regard to Major Story's conduct at the battle of Messines. It was quite without reproach. I have received a letter from the signalling officer of the 37th Battalion, which bears that out Major Story was at that time in command of the front line. He brought back the flank of his company in order to conform to the position taken up by the troops on his left. Honourable members who understand the subject will know how very awkward is the position of the commander who finds his flank "" in. the air."" That is the position which is now occupied by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. facts. made was in regard to the conversion of funds in Havre; and that occurred some time after the armistice. The honourable member for the Northern Territory has read extracts from documents to show that there were orders that Major Story should return to Australia. As a matter of fact, he did not do so, and the reason was that the General Officer Commanding, General Monash, accepted his explanation and put him in command, of another battalion. This shows that there could not have been very much in the charge. It is unnecessary that I should amplify what I said the other night; but there is a broader aspect from which this matter should be viewed, and it is that no honourable member should make use of his privilege as a member of this House to make statements within this chamber that he would not be game to make outside. When the honourable member for tbe I am sure Northern Territory first entered this chamber we thought he was going to be a splendid representative. He was the one and only representative of the Northern Territory, ancl no one here could say whether he was right or wrong in. anything he told us. I have only now to say that if the information he gives us witli regard to affairs in the Northern Territory is not more accurate than what he If the honourable member is has said concerning Major Story, it is not worth a snap of the fingers. sire to say a word or two on the matter which ..is now being discussed. Honourable members are of course aware that I am peculiarly interested in the manner in which a soldier's honour is protected by this House. While I have no comment to make on the statement of the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) regarding Major Story and his conduct in France, I remind honourable members that one has only to visit New Guinea, and on every side he will hear of men appointed to positions there by governments, though not, perhaps, by the present Government, because of their military record, who are absolutely unsuited to those positions. In support of this statement. I may on a subsequent occasion bring over a book from the South Australian Parliamentary Library, in which this charge is explicitly made regarding appointments in New Guinea. Men have been turned out of New Guinea and put back in their positions again by the Government. From this point of view it may appear that the charges made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory have been rather moderate. I do not intend to criticize Major Story, but I do wish to comment on the attitude",50,William Ramsay Mcnicol

185,Mr Yates (Adelaide) [9.35],"I dewhich is now assumed by honourable members opposite towards the honourable member for the Northern Territory, and to contrast it with the attitude honourable members on the same side assumed when I was attacked in this House. I was attacked by the then Prime Minister of the Commonwealth ( Mr W. M. Hughes). I admit that I was only a gunner. I held no rank, but I defy any one to say that I ever Mr Yates, he had a lot to say refused a duty put upon me. When the then Prime Minister attacked me he was asked by honourable members on this side to whom he referred. There were then only two men on this side who wore the returned soldier's badge, and the then Prime Minister said that one of them had changed into every unit in the Army, and had never been nearer the line than he was. He could only have referred to me when he said "" I am no soldier, but I was much nearer the line than he ever was."" Mr Considine, who was then on this side of the House, said, "" Whom do you mean?"" And the member for Adelaide at the time made it clear that the reference was to myself. not take the attack lying down. I supplied the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) with a series of questions founded upon entries in my diary. On my behalf he asked whether I was not on the gun at Villers Brefnnneux and at the straightening out of the line at ing cleared my reputation, no one has yet Morlancourt, whether I was not on the gun at Hamel, in the hop-over on the 8th August, and at the memorable pull-out at Pozieres. He asked also whether I had changed to any unit in the Army, or had asked for a change. The answer to every one of the questions I submitted to the honourable member for Hindmarsh was "" Yes,"" with one exception. It was stated that there was no record of where I was; but it was said that I could not have been in the hop-over on the Sth August, because I was then on duty at Blangy Tronville minding a dump. I wrote to the Leader of the Opposition at the time ( Mr Prime Minister of the day, but the DeTudor), and detailed the whole of my movements, as I was able to do from entries in my diary. I was able to give day and date, and honourable members are aware that, as a result of the action 1 took, honourable members on this side were able to force on the Government an inquiry into my case. I was no longer a member of the House when the attack was Mr Yates. made upon me. I had been beaten by underground statements made in my electorate. I can prove this, because, on the eve of the election the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) went to Adelaide and made a memorable speech in the town hall there. This was two nights before the election, and although he said he had nothing to say against for Mr Blundell, who stood behind the Prime Minister and the Empire. I was told the next morning that the right honourable gentleman . had "" pu.t it all over me,"" and so he had. At the declaration of the poll I said, "" Yes, I admit that I did not stand behind Mr Hughes and the Empire."" Those present roared at me, and roared at me again when I repeated ,the statement. When their noise had somewhat subsided, I said, "" I did not stand behind them; ' I went and stood in front of both of them,"" and thatmade them as quiet as sheep. Why was there no complaint from the opposite side when I , as a soldier of the I did Australian Army, was attacked ? I do not say that I performed miracles, or did any more than any other soldier; but, thank God, I had friends on this side who considered my honour worth protecting. A committee was appointed to inquire into my case, and though the findapologized for the attack made upon me. The honourable member for Warringah ( Sir Granville Ryrie) was Assistant Minister for Defence at the time, and he said, "" If I have been sold a pup, some one will have to pav for it . "" He was sold a pup, and it grew to be a mastiff and bit him, but what happened ? General Foote, the man who was responsible for what occurred, is still in his job. Some honourable members talk about a civil action in such a case, and if I had had the wherewithal to institute a civil action I should have prosecuted, not the fence Department, for supplying false information to this House to defame my name and character. When I came back to this HouseI demanded from my party some return, and they gave me so much support that the party on the other side permitted an inquiry to take place, and gave me the opportunity to obtain some little redress for the injury done me. There would appear to be some justification for the comments made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory concerning Major Story, but there was absolutely none for the statements made about me. Before my inquiry was commenced I was asked whether I would object to a colonel being on the board, and I said, "" I do not care; you can make it a general."" the greater the confirmation, and I was satisfied that my commanding officer should say what happened. I knew him, and had every respect for him as a fine officer, and I knew he would tell the truth. Wheni t came to a question of compensating me, do honourable members think that the Commonwealth paid what it should have paid ? The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten), because he was accused of telling tarrydiddles to the farmers, wants £10,000 damages. There is a great deal in what the honourable member for Batman( Mr tion, is the adoption of the wattle as the Brennan) has said concerning the attitude adopted towards the honourable mem. ber for the Northern Territory. Honourable members opposite did not do the fair thing when I was attacked by the highest authority in the land, the man who cajoled every one into going to the war, and told people that they were heroes. I was attacked because I was of a different political colour. I might have refused to go to the war, because I was over the age for enlistment, but I desired to go. I do not regret having gone. The Commonwealth is not responsible to me for anything, because I was not hurt. I do not desire a scintilla of praise, but when it comes to doing what is fair, I say that honourable members should be as fair to a gunner as they are prepared to be to a major. When I was attacked by a man in a more responsible position than that occupied by the honourable member for the Northern Territory, not one word of protest was uttered by members of the party opposite. It was proved on the floor of this House that the Defence Department, through ineptitude or a desire to please the then Prime Minister, supplied information which gave colour to the suggestion that I had not been in the line. I hope that if there is any more clearing up of this character to be done it will be done in respect of the most humble soldier, if he did his work faithfully and well, and that honourable members opposite will stand up for him as they have stood up for Major Story,, and as they should have done for me. I wish to refer to the design of the Australian coat of arms. The other day I questioned the Prime Minister regarding an announcement in the newspapers that the Government had decided to substitute the Australian coat of arms for The higher the authority, the Imperial coat of arms which has been in use since federation. I objectnot to the use of the Australian coat of arms, but to its. present design. The drawing of the animals is simply atrocious,, particularly that of the kangaroo, which is a libel on that marsupial. There are plenty of artists in Australia who would give a much better representation of that Australian native, the kangaroo, to people overseas. Another defect in the design,, apart from its general weakness, insipidity, and poverty of idea in construcnational flower pf Australia. Why should we adopt the wattle as our national flower, seeing that it is common to all countries in the southern hemisphere? We should adopt as our national flower the waratah, which is more adaptable for conventional treatment in design, and as far as I know, does not grow in any country outside Australia. Since questioning the Prime Minister regarding the design of the Australian coat of arms I have received a number'of letters from persons who support mo in my view that the design should be altered. With them has been sent a little pamphlet by Mr C. W. Peck, secretary of the Waratah League. In it he saysNo flower is more dangerous and inimical to the health of human beings than the wattle (Acacia). The profusion of pollen is a prolific cause, first of a fever (hay fever), and subsequently of catarrh. No tree is such a host for the destructive insect larva? (vide Flowering Plants and Ferns of New South, Wales, by Maiden, and Campbell, 1895). No flower is more transient or weak in character. Its wide distribution throughout tlie Southern Hemisphere precludes it from rightly being enthroned as an Australian emblem. It grows more luxuriantly in New Zealand than in Australia, and a very large portion of our continent is without it. In no sense can the wattle be termed the national flower of Australia. There are several authorities who might be quoted in support of the contention that the waratah instead of the wattle should be",51,William Ramsay Mcnicol
186,Sir Elliot Johnson (Lang) [9,"45],adopted as the Australian national flower. The pamphlet continues. That a great mistake was made when Australia, or any part of Australia, accepted any llower other than the waratah (Telopea) as thu national ono, is apparent to all who have looked into the matter and treated the historical aspect of it with that consideration which is due to it. Students of history find that eminent botanists specially idolized this native bloom in those days when the name New South Wales stood for all Australia. Sir James Smith noted it (vide A tipeoimen of ihe ISotany of New Holland) in 1793, and Curtis figured it in 1S08. All our forbears who were the pioneers of Australia cherished it as the national (lower. Botanists of later days, 'including Fred. Turner, F.L.S., and J. H. Maiden, F.L.S., wrote of it as the national llower of New Soutli Wales, and by New South Wales was meant Australia. K. T. Baker, F.L.S., has produced the most beautiful National Flower Book in the world, showing that the waratah is Australia's national flower, and how wonderfully the bloom lends itself to the applied art of all the Australian status. I shall r e f r a in from further discussing this subject, because the Prime Minister has stated that it w ill receive consideration. I hope that my suggestion w ill not be shelved, and that the present design will not continue to offend our artistic sense indefinitely. all parts of Australia? Sir ELLIOT known to grow in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania. It is not grown at present in South Australia and Western Australia, but probably it w ill be found growing on sandstone tracts in the interior of Australia. that the Government w ill take this matter into consideration at an early date, with a view to procuring a design for the Australian coat of arms more suitable than that already in use. It might be as well to invite competitive tenders for a design, and then perhaps appoint a committee of leading artists in Australia to adjudicate upon them, and to make recommendations. We should then be able to obtain a design suitable for our Oommonwealth stationery, publications, and oflicial documents. If the honourable member for Lang( Sir Elliot Johnson) could see the glory of the Australian wattle blossoming in SouthA f r i c a he would not advocate the adoption of the waratah as the national flower of Australia. make the wattle an Australian flower. Africa was grown.from Australian seed, and it has grown there so successfully that, according to the Ago, that country produces 6,000 tons of wattle-bark which we poor fools in Australia ehould be growing ourselves. grown extensively in Australia. member aware that the area planted in Australia is 47,000 acres, and in South Africa 600,000 acres? labour. would be if the honourable member were working there. I am glad that the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) has stood to his guns, although the honourable member for Bendigo( MrH u r r y ) dared him to make his statements outside. That threat comes very well from a gentleman who has two kinds of privileges. I understand that he is a legal gentleman, and we all know how the privileged libertines of the legal profession in the courts ask witnesses on oath questions they would not dare ask Northern Territory has made serious complaints about the administration of that country. I have watched the government of the Territory, and I sometimes wish that our Australians had used the methods I hope of the westerners of the United States of America, and had killed Dr. Gilruth, Judge Bevan, and another scoundrel there. I begged and implored Mr Glynn, when a Ministeri n this Parliament, to go himself to the Northern Territory or to send some honest man whose word could be trusted. Unfortunately, nothing was done. I recall my experience with the Defence Department when appealing on behalf of a poor devil named Gunner Perry. When this man was in 1 hospital over the other side of Princes' Bridge, electricity was applied to his ear, nose, and the t i p of his tongue by D r . Mead. A t 11 o'clock one night the D e r fence Department attempted to arrest Perry by sending a man of German descenti n a motor, but failed because, a magistrate of this city took that poor devil on his shoulders, carried him upstairs, and hid from the",53,William Ramsay Mcnicol

Any person who makes a claim in the law courts for debts, or anything else, must produce documents in support of it . The honourable member for the Northern Territory has to-night produced the documents. He read from the files, and. the Prime Minister quoted from memory. I do not know Major Story. He may be a relative of one of my best friends. Two complaints have been made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. Major Story has been accused in his public position as secretary, appointed by the previous Government, of actually punching a man in the street. It is nothing new. The Admin istrator sent to the Territory by the same Government assaulted a man within three months of his appointment, and was fined in the police court. Story of illegal practice. if the Governor General was fined by the court for assault? Would not the British Government recall him ? D i d the Commonwealth Government withdraw the Administrator who was fined for assault? In the case of Gunner Perry, I was refused permission to see the file for seven days, and when finally I did see it , I found that documents were missing from it . Medical men stood in the witness-box and, for the sake of the little decorations they wore as marks of their service, they swore that Gunner Perry was a malingerer. I wanted a County Court judge or a Supreme Court judge to conduct the investigation for which I asked; but I was given MrP h ill ip Cohen, who d'd not permit even the ordinary procedure of a police court to be observed. The result was that, on the second or third day, at his request, the man was sent to a receiving home at Royal Park. I may explain to those who do not know, that, in such an institution the patients are kept under observation the whole time. Some time afterwards, I asked D r . Godfrey whether Perry was a malingerer. Godfrey is one of God's good men. He has done much for the reclamation of those who suffer from alcoholism. wish the world had thousands mor * like him. [40 ] The honourable memthink he would be there for five days if It thought him a, malingerer ?"" Perry stayed in the home for six months. When he, came out he was given a pension. B y the. way, I am sorry to say that the Repatriation Department has ceased to pay his wife's pension because she cannot prove whether her husband is dead or alive; but the man who should never have been at large, if the Defence Depart-, ment was right in its contention, went to. Brisbane, and this beautiful department actually employed him to look for recruits. He subsequently turned up with another cock and-bull story, and paraded, : as a captain; and, after it had given me this fourteen days of hell, fighting in the' interests of this man, the department ac-' tually had the cool cheek to write and ask' me if I could give it any information concerning him, and tell it what was the last I had heard of him. All I had heard of him was that he had persuaded some poor girl to marry h i m ; but, fortunately, she discovered in his pocket a letter from his' wife in Melbourne. He gave her a hiding; she disappeared; he disappeared. Probably they both committed suicide. B.ut such was the action taken by a department that had men of the highest position in the medical world, swearing in the. witness-box that, in their opinion, Gunner Perry was a malingerer. A member of the present Ministry actually swore that the man had been l if t e d . ' over a hospital fence which was 7 feet high, whereas, as. a matter of fact, the fence was not more than feet high. Any one who heard the impassioned speech of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates), who suffered imprisonment, would wonder why the Prime Minister should make such a cowardly attack as he made to-night. In the words of my legal friend from Bendigo( MrH u r r y ) , he would not have dared to talk in the same way outside. . on the jaw. able member for Adelaide enlisted in an Dr. Australian regiment.

Those honourable members who haye accused the honourable member for the 'Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson), were not speaking from the book. They did 'not have the documents to read, as he did. Perhaps they allowed their enthusiasm, or their friendship for Major Story to carry fhem away when they placed on the honourable member's words a meaning that he did not intend to convey. Neither the Prime Minister nor my learned friend from Bendigo has said that the documents which the honourable member for the Northern Territory read were false. able member call a publio meeting and have the documents read there. meaning of the words used by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. said deliberately that the honourable member for the Northern Territory had said things which he did not say. 'ber for Bendigo is not denying the documents. He would not care to have similar evidence produced against himself. No soldier who loves Australia would like such evidence given against him. I am sorry the Prime Minister lost his temper. Even the unguarded language he used was not pleasing. He said it was hard to hear what , the honourable member -for the Northern Territory had said. I confess that that honourable member was under a difficulty. He was speaking a little into the floor of the chamber. But I expected better things from his lips. I expected him to say that the honourable member for the Northern Territory had read from archives whose authenticity could not be contested, and that he accepted the evidence. Then he might have made his ad misericordiam appeal, """"Let bygones be bygones."" The honourable member for the Northern Territory has faced difficulties in the north which other men who have not been there cannot possibly realize. I did not realize what they were until I had made two visits' to the Territory. He is the last man in the world not to give another a second chance. It was no wonder the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) and I interjected in anger. It is said that in a bee-hive it is only necessary for one bee to get angry to set the whole hive in niotion. When one man in an assembly loses his temper he causes others to do tha same. However, the honourable member for Batman has handled the Prime Minister very well, and I do not think that, in similar circumstances, he will again lose control of himself, as I am sorry to say he did to-night. The warmth and indignation expressed by the honourable member for Batman were well justified, and the timely rebuke the honourable member administered to the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) was I do not say so now. richly deserved. I certainly did not expect the right honourable gentleman to take upon himself the role of political bully. His attempt to intimidate and I was alluding to the overawe honourable members was most unbecoming on the part of one occupying his high and responsible position. Eveni f he had any doubts as to the merits of the case presented by the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson), that did not justify his insulting attitude. I resent it. My toleration, patience, and sense of decency were outraged by his speech. The honourable member for the Northern Territory is at least a gentleman, but I cannot say that of the Prime Minister. The debate this evening recalls to my mind other anomalies and injustices in connection with the administration of Commonwealth affairs. One man who lived in what was formerly part of my constituency was practically murdered by the Government and its officers through their refusal to grant him in his dying hours the treatment and relief he needed.

The Premier and Treasurer of New South Wales( Mr Lang) sent a telegram expressing regret that he was unable to be present owing to urgent public business, but intimating that he would favourably consider co-operation with the other states and with the Commonwealth in respect to any resolutions that might be carried. During the last eighteen months the loan operations of the Commonwealth and the states have been carried on in accordance with the agreements made by the Loan Council, which consists of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the treasurers of the states. It is admitted not only by all the governments concerned, but also by the principal financial authorities in Australia and overseas, that substantial Committee (Consideration of benefits have resulted from the work of the council.

The money market, moreover, has had definite periods of freedom from government issues, and more money has been available for private enterprise. Last year, the Loan Council arranged for the Commonwealth to act as the central borrowing authority in Australia, and it will be seen that this bill is a replica of the States Loan Act passed last year, with the exception that, whereas the latter measure specified a definite sum, the present bill provides for the borrowing by the Commonwealth on behalf of the states of such amounts as may be agreed upon by the Treasurers as necessary, and as are authorized by their respective Parliaments. This bill does not give authority to the Commonwealth to borrow for its own purposes. The necessary appropriations for Commonwealth purposes will be provided for .as occasion arises.

According to cables published in yesterday's newspapers, negotiations have taken place with some American financial interests with that object. No t so very long ago, when the Premier of Queensland was forced to' go to America to obtain the money he heeded for public works in that state, because he could not get it elsewhere, he was subjected to a good deal of adverse criticism in some quarters. It appears now, however, that this Government. proposes to follow his example. In the past we have obtained our money from London, and that has considerably helped our trade relationship w it h Great Britain. knows that, while we are supposed to receive money when we borrow abroad, we actually receive goods.

We cannot escape from the position that the overseas channel through which we receive borrowed money will be the channel through which we shall receive goods to the value of the money which we borrow. Although the hour is late. I consider it to It is questionable be my duty to place my views upon this matter before honourable members. We must carefully consider any proposal which may have the result of increasing our public debt, which is heavier now than we can comfortably carry. NobodyI t appears to be likely that the knows when it may become necessary for us to increase our debt rapidly, as we were compelled to do a few years ago. I trust that that time will not come, but I must confess that I am not at all satisfied with the way things are shaping abroad. It is for that reason that I am uttering this warning. We should be very carefully husbanding our resources. Our publio debt totals more than £1,000,000,000, and we should be straining every nerve to reduce it . Borrowing abroad must result not only in increased taxation, but in materially curtailing the development of our industries. It is absolutely essential that we shall encourage the development of our secondary industries rather than depress them. Any policy which w ill result in our receiving large quantities of Everybody manufactured goods , from abroad will-be detrimental to the best interests of Australia. While I should not be justified in opposing this b ill , for the reason that the proposals it contains have been agreed to by ' the state treasurers in consultation with the Commonwealth Treasurer, I feel justified in saying that we are entitled to the fullest information when proposals of this nature are put before us. So far as this measure is concerned, we do not know I do not know how much money each state requires; what the money is for, or whether we are justified in agreeing to the proposal to borrow it . It may be said that if the states If we wish want the money, we would not be justified in refusing to borrow it for them There is a . certain amount of truth in that, but there are other aspects of the question. We may find, after this money has been borrowed, that the purposes upon which it is being expended do not commend themselves to us. I must accept the bill on the assurance of the Treasurer that the various state governments require the money which will be borrowed. I also accept it for the reason that it gives effect It must be apparent to to a policy that I have frequently advocated, namely, that of one borrowing authority for the Commonwealth and the states.

The Treasurer should agree to a l i m it being placed upon the amount which can be borrowed. Honourable members have not yet had time to consider this bill, although it contains provisions granting to the Treasurer powers greater than are conferred' on any Minister by existing legislation. The Treasurer seems to think that there is a great deal of secrecy about this matter, and that we should know nothing about it ; but only yesterday we saw in our newspapers that J . P . Morgan and Co., the well-known financiers of the United States of America and Great Britain, are Some already making arrangements for a loan of £20,000,000 to Australia.

223,Mr West (East Sydney) [10.56],"but the Commonwealth will have to bear the burden until such time as a loan is raised to relieve the Commonwealth of the liability. There is no provision in the bill that the states shall pay interest on the money. At the present time the states issue treasury bills for terms of three months or six months, the rate of interest being 3£ or 4 per cent. In this case we do not know what the arrangement will be. We do not know who will have to bear the responsibility, nor has the Treasurer intimated whether the loans are to be raised in Australia or on the foreign market. The last loan of £10,000,000 was entirely successful, although it was floated at the very worse period in tbe financial history of the Commonwealth. In connection with loan conversions, T have always advocated the adoption of a policy that would not penalize the general pubhe, but, unfortunately, I have not been able to get the Treasurer to see eye to eye with me. that, largely because of the absence of administrative capacity on the part of the Treasurer, the rate of interest in future will be higher than the rate which ruled during the war period. No one can reasonably find fault with the principle of having only one borrowing authority for Australia, but we should certainly know something about the amount likely to be raised under this measure. It will be at least £174,000,000. Why should the bill be hurried through at this late hour? Unlike the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), I do not. object to a sound borrowing policy, but all the negotiations should evidence business capacity on the part of the responsible minister in the interests, not only of the Government, but of Australia as a whole. I shall not oppose the bill, but I feel justified in directing public attention to the obvious defects of the measure, which should have the closest attention of all honourable members. Australia will not always be in the enjoyment of bounteous seasons and high prices for her products. Droughts and financial stringency will undoubtedly recur, and we should make provision for them by effective parliamentary control of public borrowings. The secrecy displayed by the Treasurer must have a very serious effect upon loan negotiations. should definitely state, for the satisfaction of the public, the probable amount [41] to be raised under this measure. As the hour is late, the Treasurer should postpone tbe measure until to-morrow, and furnish honourable ' members with further information. As my leader has pointed out, the difficulty in the exchange position since the war has penalized our producers to the extent of from £ 3 to £ 5 per £100 on all primary products exported, and since all overseas loan transactions resolve themselves into a system of credits, Australia pays very dearly for the privilege of raising money overseas. Clause5 of the bill, which authorizes the Treasurer to make advances to the states pending the raising of loans, requires the serious attention of every honourable member. The Minister should state the position clearly for the information of the House. There are one or two features of the bill that I do not like. It appears, to me to have been very loosely drawn. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) should give a full I am very much afraid explanation regarding it. I cannot understand the indifference of some honourable members to the matter. They appear to think that, because the Government is responsible, there is no reason for alarm. Governments, however, make mistakes. We have a right to know, before the bill passes this chamber, what its effects are likely to be. The Treasurer should state what arrangements with regard to borrowing have been made. To-morrow morning it will be found that the press has been supplied with information that was not disclosed to honourable members. a very important matter.. Several hours of the present sitting were devoted to the consideration of the career of one man, and I protest against the aotion of the Government in bringing the bill forward at such a late hour, and attempting to rush it through without allowing it to have the consideration that it deserves. I agree with the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) that a schedule should be added to the bill, so that we may know the amount that it is intended to borrow. We should certainly be told whether there is any truth in the statements that have appeared in the press, that the Government proposes to alter its policy in reThe Minister gard to the places in which it intends to borrow additional sums, or to establish new credit.

Under the bill their future borrowing will come within the patronage of the Commonwealth. It may be a matter for congratulation that the Loan Council is preventing competition among the states on the loan market, and bringing about a lowering in the rates of interest. Is the Treasurer, as the representative of the Commonwealth, doing his best to cut down to the utmost the sums that are asked for by the states? We should not take this matter lightly. I think that we are becoming too lax in this chamber. member for East Sydney( Mr West) frequently speaks upon financial matters bis remarks are regarded lightly. If honourable members studied his speeches they would find in some of his statements a great deal of food for thought.

That rate of boa-rowing cannot continue, and it behoves honourable members to give the matter very serious consideration. surer) [11.19] -There are four checks imposed upon the amount that can be borrowed-the e in the bill and another that operates automatically. The first check is that the money will be borrowed for the states for one year. A further check is that the amount to be borrowed for a state must be authorized by the Parliament of that state. Loans for the states have to run the gauntlet of their respective parliaments. as may be authorized by Parliament.'""'' must be authorized by the state parliament before it can be handed over to a state government. treasury bills? is done in conformity with the provisions of our appropriation acts; but this measure does not applv to Commonwealth borroAving. The third check is that the amount asked for must be approved by the Treasurer, which, in this case means the Loan Council. The fourth safeguard, and the one which I referred to as an automatic check, is that borrowing must be limited to the amounts which can be obtained in the money market. In regard to the question whether the Loan Council exerts a curtailing influence on borrowing, I may mention what occurred only last year, when the Treasurers met, and it was found that the total amount sought to be raised was altogether too large. If the states' requirements had been considered separately, borrowing to a greater extent would have occurred, but as a result of the deliberations of the Loan Because the honourable Council, we were able to reduce the total amount by 20 per cent. The amount set down last year for the states was roughly £30,000,000, which was to be borrowed in Australia or overseas, but as we were able to raise only within several millions of that amount a further check on borrowing was provided. Reference has been made to the fact that no definite amount is stated in the bill. We could, at the outset, have stated a total amount which would have enabled the states to carry on for several months; but Parliament will be in recess after Christmas, and consequently a general authority is necessary to cover the whole year.
