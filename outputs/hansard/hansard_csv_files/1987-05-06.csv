As I have indicated, a central theme to the The legislation had its genesis in the report to judgment was that a condition precedent was which I have referred and the Committee on that there be no adverse effect on parliamentary which I had the pleasure of serving. As I have proceedings by such an interpretation in any indicated, that Committee was chaired by the particular case. But of course, the judgment ithonourable member for North Sydney, both when self-subsequently ignored, happily, by other the current Opposition was in government and Australian judgments-strikes at the very heart later when, by leave of the Government, the of the role of this Parliament, and accordingly it honourable member continued his chairmanship provided the very adverse effects which the judgafter having gone into opposition with the colment explicitly stated it sought to avoid. It really leagues, from where I imagine he will not emerge left no alternative other than for this Parliament for some considerable time.

Happily, that response appears to have a fair degree of our able member for North Sydney, I now underunanimity not only across this House but also in stand, is not proceeding with his amendment. So another place. my research on that component of the legislation will not be proceeded with.

The reason for that is that one most of that period, is one of the major powers simply cannot minimise the impact of that by which many individual members and senators amendment, as the honourable member for North saw themselves protected.

The reality is, of course, that anyone watching any of the satirical programs on the Australian A number of things can be said about the Broadcasting Corporation or elsewhere, and anyamendment. I will confine my comments to the one who has a cursory interest in satirical carfollowing points. Were the amendment to be tooning in this country, obviously would be aware adopted and one party in a civil or criminal that parliamentarians are the subject of ongoing action allowed to seek to undermine the eviridicule.

Let me give a' simple exampleproperly to ensure that those obligations of the the only one I can think of off the top of my Parliament are undertaken. So later we will come head. A witness appears before a parliamentary to discuss those draft resolutions, the carriage of committee and says that some public servant or which will be a very important part in ensuring politician-it does not matter who-was bribed. that this Parliament is better able to perform its The witness says he saw the person receive $5,000 role through the parliamentary committee system. in $100 notes.

But I feel very saw that person pay $100 notes. Of course these strongly that, where evidence is given before were not in existence at the time the alleged parliamentary committees which contradicts evioffence occurred. Under the legislation we are dence given by prosecution witnesses in a court now debating that sort of evidence cannot be case, the witnesses should be able to be crossreferred to in the defence of a person who is on examined on that evidence, or at least that it be trial.

He stated: sard, I will quote from the explanatory memoFor example, a prosecution witness in a criminal trial randum attached to the Parliamentary Privileges who gives evidence totally contrary to evidence given Bill, which explains the legislation. On page 12, by him before a Parliamentary Committee could not be in respect of sub-clause (3), it is stated: cross-examined on his Parliamentary Committee evidence for the purposes of proving he was giving perjured This sub-clause prevents the use of parliamentary evidence.
