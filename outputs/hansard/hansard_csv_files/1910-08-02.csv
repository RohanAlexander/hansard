26,Mr Mahon (Coolgardie) [3.13],"Bethis commodity are interwoven, it is almost impossible to debate one matter unless reference be allowed to the others. Howcan we discuss the questions of the sugar Excise and the bounty without dealing with the influence of the import duty upon both? At this stage, therefore, we ought to have a declaration as to how far honourable members will be permitted to proceed in discussing the issues which are involved in these Bills. It must be obvious that if, when the Excise (Sugar) Bill is under consideration, we are to be ruled out of order because we desire to debate the sugar bounty, and vice versa, and if , in connection with either of the Bills, we are not to be permitted to refer to what is fundamental to both, namely, the import duty, the discussion will be little better than a farce, and might as well be closed at once. Before we proceed further, I desire to know whether honourable members will be at liberty to refer to these matters as one conthe sugar question in its entirety. crete question?

But I do not wish to lose my opportunity ber will not lose his opportunity. that, at the present stage, I am at liberty to deal with the general question of the sugar policy of the Government, and if I shall be prevented from doing that at a later stage, I am quite prepared to avail myself of the opportunity which is now afforded me. But I do not wish to do anything which will delay the progress of business. seems to me that if both the Sugar Bounty Bill and the Excise (Sugar) Bill come before the House at the same time, you, sir, will be bound to uphold our Standing Orders. To my mind, the present time is the most opportune one for discussing the sugar question in its broader aspects. If advantage be not taken of this opportunity, it may happen that, when honourable members subsequently endeavour upon this Bill to deal with the sugar excise, you, sir, will rule that they are transgressing our Standing Orders. It would be a most regrettable circumstance if you were to permit the discharge of the duties of your office to be regulated by the wish of the House from time to time. I think, sir, that you would be the last to do that. If honourable members allow this chance to pass, I fear that, at a later stage, they may find themselves prevented from dealing with withdrawn on account of an error in it. ing to show that, if honourable members desire to discuss this question in its broader aspects, they ought to take advantage of the present opportunity, and not seek to throw upon the Chairman a difficult discretion which his sense of duty might prevent him from acting upon.

35,Mr Joseph Cook,"Ho w can the matSix WILLIAM LYNE -Honorabl e members can arrive at a common understanding. The idea is a good one; but the present is not an opportune time for a debate upon the general question to take place. -There are many good reasons why the suggestion of the honourable member for Coolgardie should be carefully considered. The Minister of Trade and Customs has been good enough to intimate that the Sugar Bounty Bill and the Excise (Sugar) Bill will be brought forward together. But I would remind him that he cannot regulate the action of the Chair. NeedI recall the circumstances, that only the other evening, when we were discussing the Naval Loan Repeal Bill, Mr Speaker ruled that we were not at liberty to discuss the question of loans generally. It is our powers on this occasion so to arrange a very far cry from that to what the Minismatters as to enable a' general debate to ter of Trade and Customs now suggests. We shall not have an opportunity, if we adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Wentworth, of hearing the speech of the Minister of Trade and Customs on each of these Bills before we discuss the whole question in a general way. We want to hear the Minister's statement, because I take it that he possesses a great deal of special knowledge. He has had the advantage of collecting particular information on the subject. I think that the honourable member for Coolgardie is quite right in saying that the only way in which what is desired can be done, is by having the whole subject dealt with .under the one generic term-sugar-and dealing with the import duty, the bounty, and the Excise altogether. Then, as the honourable member for Hume said, we shall be able to see how these subjects are interwoven, and how one affects the other. We need to have an absolutely free hand, without any such restriction as was put upon us last week. ently, the Minister of Trade and Customs desires to have an opportunity of covering the whole ground in connection with the Excise and import duties affecting sugar. It has, I think, always been the practice to discuss import duties with relation to their bearing upon Excise, the Committee being the same. In this case, the bounty on sugar has relation both to the Excise and the duty, and we cannot possibly discuss the one without the other. If I remember rightly, when Sir George Turner, then Treasurer of the Commonwealth, brought in a Bill to abolish the rebate on sugar, and to substitute a bounty, the whole question was discussed. A ruling from Mr Speaker Holder was obtained on the point, and he declared that, as it would meet the convenience of the House to do so, the whole matter might be discussed on the motion brought forward by Sir George Turner to abolish the rebate. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (North Sydney) [3.22] I raised this point when the original measure was before us, reminding the Minister of Trade and Customs of the previous occasion, when, as the honourable member for Angas has said, by tacit consent Mr Speaker permitted a general discussion to take place on the subject of the sugar industry. It was realized that a general discussion would meet the convenience of the House. It is not beyond take place on either of the Bills in question. The Minister of Trade and Customs has already introduced one of them, making a very short speech, which, to my mind, did not do the Government justice in placing before the House their policy as to this difficult sugar question. I certainly think that we might look for a more explicit and detailed statement of the whole policy of the Government. I must confess that I should be unable to deal with the whole question .at present on account of the deficiency of information regarding Use stand-point of the Government with respect to the bounty and the Excise. I consider that the House should demand to know something of the view held by the Minister of Trade and Customs-whethe r we are to remove restrictions orable member is getting away from the point. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I think it expedient that we should have a general discussion on the question, which would save the time of House; and we should also have from the Minister of Trade and Customs, or from the Prime Minister himself, some detailed and definite exposition of the whole policy of the Ministry on this question.

As tlie honourable member for Parkes has said, the matter does not rest with the Prime Minister, with the Chairman of Committees, or with any one of us. The question is one which the Speaker must decide. I have no doubt that, as other Speakers have done in similar instances, Mr Speaker will be prepared to meet the wishes of honourable members. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. OrderedThat the report be considered at once. That the resolution be adopted. It may not be within your knowledge, Mr Speaker, that when the preliminary message connected with this Bill was It is not fair that being dealt with in Committee, the point was raised as to whether it would be possible to discuss the two Bills dealing with the sugar question, with their relative significance, when either Bill was Unless under consideration by the House. Honourable members were in some difficulty in fhe Committee stage, because they felt that the whole question rested with you, as the upholder of the Standing Orders. It was felt that you would be compelled to see that they were rigidly observed, irrespective of the wishes of this or that section, or, indeed, the desire of the House as a whole. Honourable members are partiThe Chairman cularly anxious to discuss the correlation of these two Bills, and the import duty on sugar, in order that they might deal at the same time with the whole question. The import duty is not proposed to be dealt with in any Ministerial measure that has been announced. As you, sir, will be charged with the duty of deciding whether honourable members are to have the opportunity they desire, I wish to ask you whether you will give the latitude asked for when honourable members are discussing orable members that this matter has cropped up on several occasions. I think the honourable member for North Sydney was the first to raise the questionI happened to be in the chamber when it was raised-as to whether honourable members would be in order in discussing the Bounty Bill and the Excise Bill when either was immediately before the House. It would, of course, be distinctly out of order for honourable members to discuss the Bounty Bill when the Excise Bill was immediately before the House, or the Excise Bill when the Bounty Bill was under consideration. I understand that honourable members desire an opportunity to discuss the whole question involved in these measures, and what I would suggest is that the House should adopt the course of referring both Bills to the same Committee. If , after the second-reading debates, each of these Bills is referred to the same Committee,, honourable members will be given an opportunity to discuss the whole question.

They have a standing order providing for the adoption of that course, which permits of a number of Bills dealing with the same subject to be referred to the same Committee. A general discussion of the whole subject can then take place on the consideration of the Bills by the Committee. It is a bad practice to permit irregular discussion, and one which, if honourable members will permit me to say so, the House ought not to adopt. do not desire to take that course, I shall be prepared to give them ample scope to discuss the two measures at the same time. Personally, I think it would be a wrong course to follow when there is a proper course which we might adopt. that the House will follow the course I have suggested. -Some inconvenience is likely to arise from the course you, sir, have suggested, that both of these Bills should be referred to the same Committee. When they are before the Committee, the Chairman of Committees will very properly rule that honourable members must discuss them clause by clause. He will remind us from time to time that the particular clause before the Committee is the one to which we must limit our attention. The House generally seems disposed to believe that a general discussion of the subject with which they deal should be allowed on the second readings of these Bills. I submit that if the course is followed of referring them to the same Committee, we shall find ourselves in constant difficulties with the Chairman, who will contend that the general discussion of the subject should have been taken on the second reading, and that only the details of the measure should be discussed, clause by clause, in Committee. While I admit that it is a bad practice to allow one Bill to be dragged into the discussion on another, it would be a greater inconvenience if the Chairman were required to allow second-reading speeches on every clause as we reach it in each B ill ; and that, I subCommons, just as we follow the rules of mit, would be the effect of adopting the course you have indicated. My suggestion is that the feeling of the House be taken oil the matter, because, although, as a general rule, it may be undesirable to refer to one Bill in discussing another, an exception ought to* be made in the present instance. I am sure you, Mr Speaker, will agree with me that we are not here to be made victims of the rules which are framed to improve our debates; and if you refer the question to the House, and approval is given to latitude being allowed in this case, you will be able to permit honourable members, on the second reading-whe n we are taking a wide view of the Bill-to refer to one or the other. That, I submit, would be infinitely better and less likely to be attended by inconvenience or breach of If , however, honourable members the rules than the course you have suggested. Something more, I think, is required than has been suggested by the honourable member for Parkes, and your own views, MrI hope Speaker, seem to call for some supplement. To refer the two Bills to the same Committee without also giving the Committee power to hear argument on what is fundamental to both, though it is not referred to in either-woul d not be effective, and would not satisfy the House. It will be necessary, in my opinion, if this matter is to be fairly considered in all its bearings, for honourable members to have ample opportunity to refer to the influence and effect of the import duty on sugar, which is at the basis of all our sugar legislation. In your excellent reminder to the House, I did not hear you refer to this phase, which, as I have pointed out, is most important. If it is intended that the House should have an opportunity to consider the import duty at the same time that these two Bills are before the Committee, I have no more to say; but unless our powers are enlarged in Committee, and we may consider what, after all, is really the most important aspect of the question, the discussion will be idle. discussion, and save time, if I say that I feel that these questions are of such vital importance, not only to the House, but to the country, that the fullest possible latitude should be given.

On the first Bill, whedier it be the Excise Bill or the Bounty Bill, I shall place the broadest interpretation on the rules, so as to give honourable members full opportunity to discuss the question in all its bearings. On the second Bill, however, I shall have to confine honourable members strictly to the question before the Chair.

AND ARBITRATION BILL. Debate resumed from 29th July (vide That this Bill be now read a second time. When on Friday, I obtained permission to renew my remarks to-day, I was dealing with the proposal of the Government to bring within the scope of this Bill a very large number of people who heretofore have not been affected. I referred particularly to persons engaged in agricultural, viticultural, and horticultural pursuits. When we are called upon to pass legislation like this, we should be given fully and concisely the reasons which have led the Government to lay the proposal before the House. Somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 people will, for the first time, be brought within the scope of this legislation, but die Attorney-General, when moving tiie second reading, beyond a reference am not aware, Mr to the clause, and a wave of his hand with the remark, ""Very well,"" gave not a single reason, good, bad, or indifferent, for the attempt to bring within the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the large industries I have indicated. It is incumbent on the Government, in view of a sweeping change of the kind, to set clearly and fully before us the reasons for the course they suggest. We should have from them a clear statement as to the demand for the measure, the possibility of carrying it out, and how they propose to make it effective. I do not see that it should be any part of the duty of the Opposition to raise up one man of straw after another simply to knock him down again. admission, that the Opposition are only putting up men of straw in order to knock them down. because I contend that any reasons which the Government could bring forward for introducing this class of legislation would be of that character. It is utterly impossible for them to bring forward valid reasons for including those vast industries in the scope of this measure. In New Zealand, the arbitration legislation already applies to those industries, but what has been its history in that regard? I do not think honourable members opposite can point to a single award under those laws in New Zealand which has been in any way comprehensive so far as those industries are concerned. . I think that if the whole of the awards made under the New Zealand arbitration laws are investigated, only two will be found which deal with those particular industries in any shape or form. I shall have occasion to refer to those two as I go on, but what the Government propose to",21,Sugar Bounty Bill No 2

74,Mr Greene,"It is no admission,do is very different from what has been done ir. New Zealand. There, the whole of the Dominion is split up into, comparatively speaking, small areas, and the awards when made apply only to the areas concerned, and then only to the parties to the particular dispute in question. In the schedule to the award, all the parties to the dispute are set out. From the fact that only two New Zealand awards are even remotely associated with these particular industries, we can fairly assume that there is practically no demand for the application of this kind of"" legislation to them. If the state of things in the agricultural and dairying industries had been what some honourable members opposite would have us believe, it is only reasonable to suppose that in a country where this legislation has been already extended to those industries there would have been a large number of disputes, a large number of applications to the Court, and a large number of awards, just as there have been in the concentrated industries of the city and the mining camps in both Australia and New Zealand. That is only what one would expect, and hence I think it will be impossible for the Government to show that there is a demand for the application of tiiis class of legislation to those industries. On the other hand, there is the widest possible difference between the proposals of the Government in this measure and the arbitration laws as they apply to those industries in .New Zealand, because there, as I have already pointed out, the awards apply only to small areas. That, in fact, is the only possible way to make an award applicable to such industries. is proposed to bring the whole scope of these vast industries, scattered all over this great Commonwealth, and employing very nearly half-a-million of our people, under the operation of one award and one common rule. That is the real object of this Bill, but it is utterly impracticable, and, if attempted, will break down of its own weight. In dealing with the great question of arbitration, there are three or four conditions which are absolutely indispensable to enable any Court to make an award which shall be fair, just, and reasonable to all the parties. There must be ..regular methods and conditions of working, a reasonable certainty of return, a reasonable certainty in the conditions of employment throughout the industry, and a similarity and control of economic conditions. I think it will be found that in regard to those four points there exists the greatest possible difference, comparatively speaking, between the settled industries of our great cities and centres of population and the agricultural and dairying industries. I am satisfied that every one understands how that must be so; nevertheless, I feel that I must occupy the time of the House for a little while to show that, in view of those four conditions, it is impossible to bring before any Court facts which would enable it to make an award applying throughout the lengdi and breadth of the Commonwealth, that could in any way approach what is just and right, or that would not operate with very great injustice to a great many of our producers. One of the first reasons which ,1 desire to submit is this : In the industries of the cities, towns, and mines throughout the Commonwealth there are 12,859 "" e m ployers, who employ the large number of 257,526 workmen, or one employer, on theaverage, to twenty workmen. But in the scattered industries of the agricultural and dairying interests throughout the Commonwealth, as nearly as I have been able to ascertain the figures from the official records available, there are as many as; 130,000 employers, who employ, in their own families and outside them, altogether 422,000 individuals. That one fact shows immediately the very great difference between the two classes of employment. There is, on the one hand, a small compact body of men dealing with a large number of employees, and, on the other, a vast number of men, practically one-third of the total number engaged in the inHere, however, it dustries themselves, employing one here and another there from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. It will therefore readily be seen that there is at once a very great difference in the basis upon which it will be possible for the Court to make an award. What is more, we cansee instantly that it is far more difficult to make an award that will be in any way just and equitable. I do not wish to discuss all the intricacies of the subject; I place before honourable members that one phase, so that they may see how difficult it would be to bring employers and employees together, and to bring to bear facts that would in any way enable the Court to determine what is a reasonable wage to pay. In the dairying industry, of which I know more, possibly, than I do of any other industry that comes within the scope of this Bill, we have the Widest possible set of conditions imaginable. the length and breadth of the Commonwealth, under all sorts of conditions. iLeaving Tasmania, South Australia, and -Western Australia out of the question for ""the time being, let us consider the conditions in the Western District and Kyneton, Victoriaj in Bega, New England, and Richmond, New South Wales; and in Blackall, Toowoomba, and Beaudesert, Queensland-all typical dairying districts, scattered, in some instances, very widely, and in others comparatively only a few miles apart, yet presenting the widest possible differences. I have seen dairying in Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, and I can assure honourable members that it would be utterly impossible for me, with my knowledge of the industry and of the way in which it is carried out throughout the Commonwealth, to say that such and such a wage should be paid to any set of employees in it. My knowledge of the varying conditions in, and varying returns from, the industry in different parts of the Commonwealth would make it impossible for me to fix an award which would be just to employers and employees. I have been referring to the position where dairying, pure and simple, is carried on; but when we remember that many of our farmers are engaged in mixed farming, that we have both agriculture and dairying, horticulture and dairying, horticulture and agriculture, agriculture and grazing, carried on by the samp men, we must realize that the position becomes still more complicated, and that it is infinitely more difficult, in such of labour goes up. I have never known circumstances, to make an award that will be just and equitable to all concerned. I come now to the question of certainty of returns. Here honourable members will at once grasp the difference between the city and town industries and the dairying and agricultural industries. It is possible to say, with reasonable certainty, what will be derived from a city industry; it is possible to regulate prices, and so on; but it is utterly impossible even to speculate upon the returns that will be gathered' from the land. That being so, honourable members will recognise the fundamental difference between settled industries in the city and the more uncertain industries of the rural districts. tend with something which no other industry has to face; I refer to the weather. It niay so happen that one shower of rain will rnake a difference of hundreds of pounds Mr Greene. in the returns which a farmer will gel from Dairying is carried on throughout his land in a year. I know many cases where a farmer, after harvesting his crop, has been out of pocket, and Iknow of others where a farmer, after harvesting, has obtained little more than is sufficient for a living. Do not all these considerations complicate the difficulty of making a just award? ficial shower which falls at the right time, and means a handsome profit to the farmer? member think that when a shower does fall at the right time the farmer makes a fortune out of it? A good season makes up for the lean years, during which he has practically put nothing in his pocket and has had to mortgage his lands to carry on. the same in various industries. dependent upon weather conditions to the extent that the farming industry is. In the settled industries of the cities a man can make a fairly accurate calculation. He can say, "" I have so much of this and so much of that, and if I borrow a certain amount I shall be practically sure of a certain return."" In the farming industry a man cannot make such a calculation. After all, the position is that when the returns are short, and work is scarce, wages fall, for the simple reason that the farmers cannot afford to pay high wages. On the other hand, when the crops are plentiful, work must be plentiful, and the price of a case where, when there was a plentiful harvest and a difficulty in gathering in the crops, farmers were not prepared to meet their hands, and to meet them handsomely, in order to get their crops placed under shelter. affect every industry. farming industry more than any other. The honourable member cannot point to any other industry where the question of weather counts for so much. Another point relates to the general economic conditions: A Tariff wall may be set up to enable any settled city industry to pay an In farming we have to conaward of the Court; but, with the large agricultural and dairying industries that is impossible., __We know that Australia is dependent upon"" the markets of the world, so far as her produce is concerned, and that",22,Second Reading

They must see how difficult it is to treat particular inof the farmers should join a union. dustries, which are subject to great fluctuations, from the stand-point that we can treat the industries of the cities, which have settled conditions. I want to touch for a moment or two on the kind of labour which is available for the industries. In the settled industries of the cities the employees are nearly all tradesmen, but in the country districts all grades of workmen are to be found working in the same industry. I have met men who are worth three times as much as other men. You can set one man to work, and leave him, feeling that upon your return the job will be done as you desired. When honourable members remember that a great number of old men are employed in agricultural industries they will readily realize how difficult it would be to apply the clauses relating to incompetent workmen to men, who are scattered all over the Commonwealth. A rural industry is not like a settled industry, where the parties are in constant communication with the Registrar and the machinery of the Act in regard to all these matters is easily available, and an incompetent workman can be employed at a lower rate of wages. In the country that is not practicable. When honourable members recollect that all these different grades of workmen are employed in the agricultural industries, they will realize all the more how difficult it would be for the Court to take all these points into consideration, and lay down a particular scale of wages to be paid. have heard it since I was eleven years of age. the honourable member has heard the yarn, it does not interfere with the fundamental truth of-what I have been saying. paid fair wages in the past, we should not behere. which I do not think the honourable member for Melbourne Ports properly appreciates is this, that a great many farmers employ the members of their own families to assist them. from school. their children from school. honourable member for Flinders was discussing the question, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports said that the sonssible for many of our settlers to exist under such conditions.

He will thenrealize what is being done by our country folk, and will not suggest that the sons of the farmers should join a union. I think that I have shown the impossibility of"" dealing with the rural industries in themanner proposed. It might be possible to* regulate them as to both hours of labour and wages, could we follow the New Zealand example, but the Constitution does not empower us to do so. The honourable member for Darling said that in the interests of the farmers a rural union should be established, inasmuch as it would be better for them to have their disputes settled by a Court than to have their corn fall out of the ear when ripe. He meant us to believe either that the Court would settle disputes before the corn was ripe, and before it would be possible to determine the profits of the farmer, or that it would hold its inquiry between the ripening and the harvesting of the corn. Neither course is possible. A dispute could not be adjudicated upon after the corn had ripened, and it would not be possible to make a just award unless the return which the farmer would get from his crop could be determined with some certainty. In New Zealand, a small award regarding harvesting was made to apply to a district which has never known a bad season or a failure of crop; but in Australia, climatic conditions vary so much that it would be impossible to make an When the rally.

If honourable districts they will find that the employees in the industry are as clean, decent, and well dressed a set of men as any other section of the community. I do not mean to suggest that they enter the milking yards in their best clothes, but I do say that the employ6s in the agricultural and dairying industries will compare favourably, from the stand-point of their cleanliness, with those engaged in any other industry. The statement of the honourable member for South Sydney is a gross misrepresentation of the condition of the industry, and is absolutely without foundation. the honourable member to go into my district and repeat it.

It will mean laying upon their shoulders a very heavy burdena burden which they are unable to bear. I do Bill, it will seriously weigh the whole of the considerations which I have brought forward. To sum up, I desire to say that in none of the four matters that I have mentioned is it possible to bring such a statement of affairs before the Court as will enable it to make a fair award. There are no regular methods of working in the dairying industry, and you cannot have them, owing to our varieties of climate, the vast extent of the Commonwealth, and the great differences under which the dairying industry is carried on. Again, It is utterly impossible to rely upon such a thing. There must remain the widest possible differences in the case of employees engaged in this great industry. There is not, and there cannot be, equality of economic conditions. What is more, we cannot control those economic conditions. tion and Arbitration Act, and makes more workable the general principles of conciliation and arbitration, I am in complete accord with it.

It means that we are going to lay very heavy burdens upon the shoulders of men and women who are struggling often against fearful odds to carve out homes for themselves, and it must, in my opinion, be detrimental to the workers of Australia. It will probably tend to reduce production. I have not attempted to deal with the legal technicalities of the Bill, and to consider whether or not we have power to say, as a matter of law, that there shall be no question of dispute with regard to preference to unionists. I have said nothing as to whether we have power to lay it down as a principle that only the members of organized .unions have the right to work. These are questions which I leave to those who are better able to judge. But I do urge that in subscribing to this doctrine of preference to unionists in the form in which we find it enunciated in this measure, we are committing ourselves to a system of coercion which, to my mind, only finds its counterpart in the religious intolerance of the dark ages. Before we take this step, we ought to weigh carefully what we are doing. AVe ought to consider the whole of this great question. If we do that, I do not think that there will be any doubt as to the result. And now, several members on this side of the House having forfeited their right to speak further on the measure at the present stage, I have to conclude by moving the following amendmentThat the word "" n o w "" be left out and that the words "" this day fortnight,"" be added to the question. [4.46] -In reading this Bill, I have been forced to the conclusion that there has been a strange mistake in its title. It is not really a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, but a Commonwealth Industrial and Political Coercion Bill. imitating Mr Wade, ture to say that the Premier of New South Wales never, in his wildest dreams, imagined anything so drastically coercive and tyrannical as this Bill is. I am quite certain that ultimately its worse defects will be felt by those in whose interests it has ostensibly been framed. There is not a line of it which does not aim at curtailing the liberty of the subject. There is ployers. not a line of it which is not aimed at shearing off some privileges and some liberties which the workers of this country at present enjoy. We have here a typical illustration of the latest efforts of the modern Labour party, which does not attempt to legislate in the interests of the whole community, but seeks to set up a system of class legislation of the very worse kind. According to the honourable member for Darling, the Bill is intended to be mainly in the interests of the employers. Of course, we know the honourable member for Darling very well. We know how readily he can tune his opinions to the humour and the exigencies of the moment without moving a muscle or turning a hair, arguing in one line now and a totally opposite one an hour hence. I venture to say, however, that he will not tell his own constituents that this Bill was framed in the interests of the employers. He will have a very different tune to sing to them. He will be very careful to explain to them, and to the members of labour organizations outside, that this Bill is designed as a blow to the employers. But, because there-happen to be some honourable members on this side of the Chamber who, rightly or wrongly, are credited with a leaning in the direction of the interest of employers, the honourable member plausibly tries to obtain sympathetic support from them. I do not hold, and never have held, a brief for employers. I have ever held a brief for justice. I quite agree with an interjection made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, that if employers had, in the past, done their duty, a great many of the men now holding seats in this House would not be here to-day. I say that employers have brought a good deal of this tyrannical sort of legislation upon themselves. They are mainly responsible for the reaction which has taken place, and which has caused the pendulum to swing to the other extreme. Not all of them, of course, but too many, whose greed, selfishness and lack of consideration for employees has engendered very natural discontent and the desire for retaliation. It is these employers who are mainly responsible for legislation of this character, which endeavours, in a wrong way, to right conditions which ought never to have prevailed in Australia.",28,Second Reading

It has been from the greed and avarice of certain individual employers that the political labour movement has grown, and has developed on socialistic, liberty-destroying lines, such as we see embodied in diis Bill. I say whatever with employers who have been guilty of practices which no fairrrinded man could justify. At the same time, I contend that, in trying to rectify injustices suffered by employees, and to bring about better conditions and a reversal of the evil practices hitherto in vogue, the Labour party are proceeding to the other extreme. They are setting up for one system of class legislation that did exist in the past another system of class legisladefects to be most glaring. They have tion which they desire shall prevail in the future. That is why moderate and democratic men cannot follow the Labour party now. Equal justice is denied in their programme, and class tyranny and coercion, even of their own class, is set up in its stead. That is not the way to remedy grievances. about another reaction, and the swing of the pendulum again to the other extreme. The honourable member for Darling said that the sole object of this measure is to secure peace and prevent industrial disputes. That is exactly what was said when the original Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was introduced in the New South Wales Parliament. The same thing was said when a similar measure was introduced in the New Zealand Parliament. It was claimed that the object was primarily to secure industrial peace by preventing industrial disputes and strikes. sures largely achieved their object? tainly not. Industrial disputes are arising every day, and they are, in fact, in some instances, apparently promoted for the purpose of bringing about litigation in the interests of certain legal Labour gentlemen who find such litigation very profitable to themselves. We were assured that this legislation would have the effect of bringing about industrial peace, and preventing recourse to the barbarous method of the strike. When it was pointed out, by members of the Liberal party in New South Wales especially, that the legislation would not achieve its declared object, would not safeguard the community against the disastrous effects of strikes, and would not bring about industrial peace, but would ultimately break down of its own weight, those who pointed out its defects were proclaimed from the housetops and from every Labour political platform as the mortal enemies of that I have no sympathy labour. The statement, of course, was not true, but, like many other statements, it was made with the desire to inflame the minds of prejudiced and self-interested men against those who desired to prevent injustice being done. Such statements were tesorted to for the purpose of making political capital at the expense of the political opponents of those who made them. Experience of the working of these Conciliation and Arbitration Acts has shown their not achieved the purpose for which they were intended. When awards made under them have not been of a one-sided character, and in the interests of the labour side in particular disputes, they have, in many cases, been ignored or set aside, and strikes have resulted. We have It must ultimately bring seen the continuation of strikes, notwithstanding the existence of this class of legislation. Recourse will still be had to strikes when awards are made which are unsatisfactory to employees. There seems to be no power to enforce awards against them, although there is always power to enforce awards against employers. In this respect, these Conciliation and Arbitration Acts have proved to be very one-sided. I do not tiiink it necessary to quote from New Zealand reports on this subject. Honourable members may have read some of them, and they will admit that the effect of legislation of this kind in New Zealand has belied every claim made for it upon its introduction. Now we have the familiar statement once more that the purpose and primary object of this Bill is to secure industrial peace and prevent industrial disputes. In my opinion, its primary object is to dragoon all workers in all industries into trade unions. Its real object is more political than industrial. Its primary object is to force all workers, whether willing or unwilling, into trade unions by depriving them of the right to live if they do not join a union. Once they have been forced to join unions, the idea is that they shall become the political agents of, and shall be coerced into supporting, the political party at present claiming to represent them.

138,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"Cerman who reads this Bill in the light of recent .and current events, can come to any other conclusion than that the primary object of this measure is more political than industrial, and that it is intended to create a political oligarchy controlled from the Federal centre. It is a long step in the direction of unification which will give to the Labour party in power practical control over the whole of the industries throughout the Commonwealth, and the whole of the political organizations associated with the labour movement. That that is the design of this Bill is as plain as a pike-staff. It is as well that we should realize-that, and should bear the fact in mind in dealing with the Bill in Committee. So far as the settlement of industrial disputes is concerned, I should very much have preferred the adoption of a system of non-political Wages Boards. been proved to be very much more satisfactory agencies for the settlement of industrial disputes than the Conciliation and Arbitration Courts, and they are far less expensive. If we had Wages Boards established throughout the States, they would be able, with a complete knowledge of local conditions, to more satisfactorily, and less expensively, adjust the relations between employers and employees. member recommend Wages Boards for the farming industry? we have any tribunal at all, I should certainly say there should be Wages Boards for farmers as well as for others.

I am not here as an advocate for the employers. orable member in a little while ! educate the honourable member in many matters of this kind; indeed, I think I went a long way towards educating him, and a number of others associated with him, long before they were in the Labour movement. I then held the views I am now expressing, and I hold them stillI continue to hold fast to the great principle of freedom which has always been my watchword and my guide in all political questions affecting the rights and privileges of the community. One of the main objections to this measure is that it takes away the freedom of individuals and undermines all the rights of private citizens. ' It cuts away all the liberwhich do not seek to abuse the power of ties we at present enjoy, and seeks to make the workers neither more nor less than political and industrial automata, to be moved at the will of a controlling authority. these things?

And the Wages Boards are a better method, in my opinion, being less open to grave objections on a variety of grounds, and, what is more, much more expeditious. The compulsory preference to one set of workers over another is a denial of a man's natural right to live. The .honourable member for the honourable Darling told us that the best workers are already in unions, and that that was a reason for insisting on preference; but the weakness of that argument is patent after a moment's superficial examination. If it be true that the best men in the various trades are already in the unions, there is no necessity for compulsory preference. Employers have to pay the standard rate of wages, and naturally desire to have the very best men, and they will not go outside the unions, because, if the honourable member be right, only inferior mentan be there obtained-if all the best men are in the unions, all the worse men must be non-unionists. So that the argument of the honourable member is extremely weak; indeed, so far from being an argument why a preference clause should be embodied in the Bill, it is the strongest argument why such a clause should be omitted. On the hustings, and on public platforms generally, many members of the Labour party, including the Attorney General himself, declared that they are for the principle of equality of opportunity for all.

But preference compulsory and unqualified by any conditions is a fatal blow to individual rights. of a most pronounced type. the successful Labour candidates denied that the Labour party proposed, or intended to propose, preference to unionists. spite of those electioneering declarations we have here a measure which gives them the absolute lie. Bill gives the absolute lie-a n absolute conpute extending beyond the limits of any one tradiction-to the declaration that the Labour party stands for equality of opportunity for all-it is a denial of the first basic principle of Democracy. about the most undemocratic measure ever submitted to this or any other Parliament. and more; it denies to every individual equality of opportunity to work and earn his own living how and on what terms he may, unrestricted except by the equal right of every other individual. This Bill provides only for the right of certain individuals to live, and demands that the rest of the community in similar industries shall, unless they belong to a certain organization, be compelled to starve. This measure is certainly a fine appeal to the humanitarian instincts of the people ! The great party, which declares that it stands for humanitarian ideals, denies to the majority of the community the right to live, the right of liberty, and the right to the pursuit of happiness-the three great essentials of Democracy embodied in the preamble to the American Constitution. platform. why is it not observed in the legislation of ' the party ? lute denial of all those fundamental principles. only those who join an organization, whether willingly or not, shall be recognised by the law of the great Commonwealth of Australia as having the right to live, move, and have their being.

The preference It is coercion clause is absolutely indefensible on any ground of ethics, justice, or common humanity. I do not desire to deal with the various clauses, because an opportunity will be presented in Committee, but there are two provisions to which I should like to briefly refer. One is clause 2, sub-clause b, by which it is proposed to omit the definition of "" industrial dispute "" from the original Act, and insert in its stead the following:"" Industrial dispute "" means an industrial disState and includes(a) any dispute as to industrial matters arising between an employer or an organization of employers on the one This is part, and an organization of employees on the other part, and and particularly(i)""Any dispute in relation to employment in an industry carried on by or under the control of the Commonwealth or a State, or any public authority constituted under the Commonwealth Dr a State. If honourable members refer to the Commonwealth Law Reports, page 488, they will see that a provision of this kind, so far as it applied to railway servants, was declared to be ultra vires of the Constitution. Whilst this clause does not make specific mention of railway servants, it does mention employment in an industry controlled by the Commonwealth or the State. Of course, State employees on railway trains and stations would not come under the category of persons employed in ah industry, but in the State Railway Departments, as in other Departments, there are numbers of men employed in locomotive construction and repairing works, carriage-building works, painting, carpentering, fitting, upholstering, and so on.

In speaking to the clause in Committee I could quote many specific instances and details explanatory of what I intended to convey to the House. I purposed reading the clause, so that honourable members might understand what I was referring to.

I wanted merely to mention the fact that I had not known that ruling to be given before. The clause is a dangerous provision, and, if carried into law, will open the way to very grave abuses. That is all I wanted to say on the general principle of the clause, but, as I am not permitted to read it, of course I cannot explain to honourable members in what way it will lead to grave abuses. I am, therefore, unable to deal with the general principle of the Bill so far as it is covered by one of its chief clauses, and my remarks must necessarily be curtailed. I am not able to deal with the matter in a general way, because I am not permitted even to read the clause, and it is of no use to attempt to deal with the clause unless one is protesting against the undemocratic character of the measure as a whole, protesting against it as being a denial of the equal right to work, and of the right to equality of opportunity which every worker in the community should enjoy. I protest against it because it is class legislation of the very worse kind, because it is based on flagrant injustice to the majority of workers, and because it undermines one of the most sacred principles of liberty, which hitherto we have prided ourselves as Australians on enjoying, and on having inherited as one of the most priceless gifts that we have received from the Mother Country.

This wonderful, independent man of whom the honourable member for Lang spoke-thi s man who does not desire to have anything to do with a union -mus t be either a knave or a fool. He is either a knave, because he hopes by telltale practices and the exercise of like qualities, to improve his employment at the expense of his fellow worker, or else he is a fool because he believes that he, isolated, can confront the capitalist on the one hand, and organized labour on the other. Such a position is unthinkable from the stand-point of any sane man. Honourable members talk of liberty, and the right of every individual to enjoy his freeand politically. Let me say a word dom. We admit that; but in what society have we that liberty of which honourable members opposite speak? has a man, for instance, to make himself a nuisance in Melbourne to-day? does, he is soon sent where he ought to be-h e is sent to gaol. There is such a thing as liberty, but honourable members opposite are advocating, not liberty, but licence. If any body of workers attempted to make their organizations a class monopoly; if they barred their doors to men seeking admittance to their organizations, they would not be entitled to register. We are not legislating for such men, and in that fact we have an answer to some of the contentions of our opponents. I believe there is one society which used to take up that stand, but the organizations with which I am' connected in South Australia welcome men to their ranks. We realize that it is more desirable to have. a man with us than against us, and in the very nature of things every inducement is offered to a man to join a union. sible for the honourable member to get into a capitalistic union. to do so. The proposal to grant preference to unionists is, to my mind, reasonable. Honourable members must set aside all prejudice, and realize that the only protection which a worker enjoys is that which his union gives. His union is the Only organization through which he can treat with his employers as a bod>'. That being so, the logical sequence to my mind is that such organizations should be recognised. 'We are leaving the track followed by our fathers; we are realizing that these troubles have to be faced, and since we are setting up a tribunal to deal with industrial disputes, it is only fair-and I am not advocating class interests-that we should empower the Court to grant preference to unionists. Wherein lies the evil? Let us consider the other side of the question. What evil will flow from the granting of preference to unionists? It will have a tendency, some honourable members say, to increase the number of unionists. If it does, what evil will follow? The honourable member for Lang said just now that we were indulging in a good deal of humbug, and that the real object of the Labour party in supporting this Bill was to build up trade unions, and to make them stronger both numerically or two with regard to that point. We hear a great deal about the power of What liberty the Labour organization, but I would point out that there is a power stronger than the If he Labour organization or the Fusion organization-stronge r than any political partyand that is Australian mother wit. From the day on which the Labour organization, or the Labour party, outrages the common sense of the Australian people, its decline will begin. I ask honourable members to look at that, phase of the question. Too much talk is indulged in, both here and in other Parliaments on the Continent, about Conservative checks, and we are told to be very careful not to go too far this way or too far that way. In the Mother Country the greatest check has always been the common sense of our forefathers, and in Australia the greatest check is the mother wit which we possess equally with our British brothers. Therefore, I do not fear that a great disaster will result to the handful of persons who are outside the unions from our giving preference to unionists. good big handful! assume the argument of honourable members on the other side. Their contention has been that if we pass the Bill, and give preference to unionists, we shall materially increase the numbers in the unions. Well and good.

192,Mr Archibald,"What I insist onis largely experimental. Evolution in trade, commerce, and industry is rapid, and we must move with the times. Arguments which carried weight with our fathers cannot carry weight with us. We must live in the actual world, with all its great possibilities. Great patriotism, great honesty, great prejudice, and great meanness, exist side by side, and have to be counted upon as factors in the making of our history. The Australian people expecjt this Parliament to do something to prevent the recurrence of what happened last year at Newcastle. congratulate the honourable member for Hindmarsh upon having been able to confine his remarks to the discussion of the benefits of compulsory arbitration, without touching upon the great principles underlying the measure now before the House. His speech carried us back to the year 1903, when this House was discussing the advisability of adopting compulsory arbitration. That principle was adopted many years ago, and neither the strike at Newcastle nor trie question of conciliation nor of arbitration has anything to do with this Bill. I would like to point out to honourable members what the measure really does mean. The honourable member for Hindmarsh reminded us that we are living in an age when principles of co-operation and of self-interest combine for the advancement of mankind. But I maintain that the interests of mankind can be advanced only by the intelligent activities of man himself. They will never be advanced by organizations from the management of which men divorce themselves. If this Bill becomes law, one of its first results will be to take out of the ment. hands of the members of industrial unions the control of the rules of those unions, because their members will have less opportunity of realizing the value of those rules, since they will not be drawn up under the broad system laid down by an Act of Parliament. One of the proposals embodied in the measure is the repeal of that portion of the principal Act which prescribes certain broad lines upon which the rules of unions must be framed. One of the safeguards in that Act is a provision that every union in its rules shall arrange for the control of the committee by general or special meetings. If we wipe out that rule, we shall enable the committee to run the whole show irrespective of the members pf the particular union concerned. An organization conducted upon such lines is foredoomed to dry rot and failure. My remarks in this connection apply to the proposed abolition of schedule B of the principal Act. Another safeguard embodied in that Statute is a provision for the manner in which the consent of an association shall be obtained to any proposal for submission to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. In other words, the Act practically lays it down that a union must take corporate action. Its members have to support the action of their executive before any proposal can be put to the Court. But under this Bill the executive of a union will have carte blanche to commit it to anything that it may choose ! The principal Act also safeguards the manner in which an association shall be represented before the Conciliation and Arbitration Court; whereas this Bill leaves it absolutely imsafeguarded. These are a few of the points to which die speech of the honourable member for Hindmarsh directed my attention-owin g to his omission to deal with them. I do not approach the consideration of this question-as he suggested honourable members upon this side of the House do-fro m a prejudiced standpoint. If I were a working man, undoubtedly I should be a trade unionist. But just as undoubtedly I would take an interest in the affairs of my union, and I would not welcome a Bill of this character, which will throw the whole of the industrial affairs of great organizations into the hands of a few self-styled organizers the honourable member speaks are the keenest intellects in the industrial movegest that the keenest intellects in industrial organizations are to be found in the paid secretaries of those organizations. I would remind honourable members of the very frame-work of the principal Act. It aims at securing industrial peace by setting up a Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to decide any questions of industrial dispute. In order that the time of that, tribunal may not be occupied by countless appeals on the part of individual litigants, Parliament has in that Act decided that the powers of capital and of labour should, as far as possible, be concentrated in organizations of employers upon the one hand, and organizations of employees upon the other. These organizations-no t necessarily trade unions, 1 would remind my honourable friends-ar e",37,Second Reading

So that, first of all, Parliament granted a preference to members -of industrial organizations under rules drawn up to facilitate the working of the Statute; and, secondly, a preference was granted to unions which registered in compliance with the idea underlying the Act, and in recognition of its spirit. So that if the spirit of that Act be obeyed, and if a preference be .granted to unionists, the moment a man stays outside an organization his efforts to -earn a livelihood will be seriously hampered. Parliament recognised that in 1904. It realized that if a man remained outside a altogether-that it is far better for the union union his livelihood might be imperilled, and, consequently, it inserted safeguards in the principal Act, under which a union is -compelled to admit any competent workman to its' ranks, and is also prevented from black-mailing or tyrannizing over those who are driven to join it by legislation which is designed purely to prevent industrial strife. All this the Bill now before us proposes to repeal. I would ask my honourable friends, who are strong trade unionists-and I differentiate between trade unionism and industrial unionism under the terms of this Acthow they think that the recruiting of trade unionists by means of force will effect their aims? It is claimed-and I admit it is true-that the most enthusiastic workmen in Australia are to be found within trade unions. not the enthusiasm of the workmen the result of the enthusiasm which actuates the members of theunions ? Is it not due to the fact that every man is proud of his union, and is bent upon doing his very best for it? Do my honourable friends expect to see that same spirit exhibited by men who are compelled to join a union ? I do not ask honourable members opposite to accept my verdict upon a matter of this kind, but I do ask them to accept the verdict of one of their own colleaguesI refer to the honourable member for South Sydney, who was for a long time a member of the New South Wales Arbitration Court. He sat beside the President of that tribunal as one That of its elected Judges. The first quotation to which I invite attention is one from the AVhen an organization is honourable member, who is admitted to be an authority on the trade unionist movement throughout Australia. It is taken from a report of the dispute in which the Sydney Wharf Labourers' union had refused to allow a competent workman to join its ranks. The registration of that union was proposed for cancellation by the Registrar on that ground, and an action was brought before the President of the New South Wales Arbitration Court. On that occasion, Mr Riley, now the honourable member for South Sydney, spoke as follows (Vol. V., p. 235, N.S.W. Arbitration Records)I say as a trade unionist that there is too much importance put upon this preference clause to sacrifice any preference rather than give up the vital principle of seleciing a man who may come into their midst with the view to breaking the union up. Now this is a very important point. You must, if you are going to give preference to industrial organizations, insist upon those organizations allowing into their ranks every man who is competent as a workman to be there, irrespective of wheIn the first place, ther he has in the past been a strikebreaker, and of the stand-point from which he may have viewed trade unionism. or not. is a competent workman he is entitled, by every principle of public polity, to be admitted into any union that secures the privilege of preference from the Legislature. under the present Act that a person should be admitted under such circumstances. from the arbitration reports in connection with a case with which the Attorney-General was thoroughly conversant. nitely further than the New South Wales Act, because there were certain vague safeguards in that legislation.

But we are dealing, as I cannot emphasize too strongly, with industrial organizations; and an industrial organization that wishes for preference at the hands of the law must, in common conscience, give the law a guarantee that it will not use the instrument put into its hand to prevent an honest man from earning an honest livelihood by honest means.

According to his affidavit, it would appear that the reason for his unsuccess was that he had worked on some wharf during a strike during some trouble between the employers and the employees. After making several attempts to be admitted, he reported the matter to the Registrar under the Arbitration Act, and the Registrar then held an inquiry and took evidence and heard argument. On the 9th April he gave his decision, in which he stated that he had come to the conclusion that he must apply to the Court for cancellation of the registration on the ground that Rule4 was either inadequate, or had not been bond fide observed; but he stated at the same time that if O'Dwyer was elected, and if the union showed a disposition to comply with its rules properly, he would report that fact to this Court, and as far as it rested with him, would not press his application.

On the 17th he lodged the application, which was to come cn on the 23rd; that gave the union six days more; but when the matter came on, on the 23rd, the union had done nothing, and we were informed by Mr Harrison, the financial secretary of the the union (a proceeding that appears to me, I must say, to be unmeaning; I do not underto do during the eight days? not earn his livelihood. him. care a "" two-penny dump "" for the non-union workers.in this case.

The President had something further to say in regard to this. *43)These acts speak for themselves. The conduct of the' union in 1904 was characterized by Ihe then Court as "" autocratic and tyrannical in the extreme."" The conduct set out above is, to my mind, tricky, underhand, and dishonest in the extreme. The Attorney-General will remember the facts of the case, as he was representing the men in it ! The circumstances connected with this particular case go to show that if we compel men to become members of unions, it is absolutely essential that we should insure their right to enter them if they see fit to make application to do so. Otherwise, we shall be invading their right to work, which is the basis of their right to live. This House must do nothing of that nature unless it wishes to hold itself up to the execration of all right-minded people throughout the world as a House in which a majority, in order to secure a paltry political advantage, will interfere with the right to labour of a class of people who deserve our sympathy and support more than any other section of the community we represent. Honourable members who represent trade unions are aware that trade unionists are, so to speak, the [33] I would ask him to aristocracy of labour. They are engaged, as a rule, in some skilled occupation, and, at any rate, are men who have the advantage of more or less regular employment in the same calling.

I have given the House what the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court had to say on the question of the exclusion of O'Dwyer. Let me place his words on record as showing what he considers should be the public policy underlying measures of this character. He said (Vol. V., pp. 247248)When I consider the provisions of the Act, it seems to me that upon broad constitutionalprinciples of the highest importance it must be held that the right of vote possessed by trade unions has been taken away from industrial unions, and that the admission of members into the latter must be carried out on principles to be decided by the Court and not by the union. These principles may vary in different cases; but whatever principles the Court lays down, it will, of course, bear carefully in mind the preservation of the rights and liberties which belono;to the citizens of every free country.

In any case in which the Court directs that preference shall be given, it may subsequently suspend or qualify the direction for such time or subject to such conditions as it thinks fit, if , in the opinion of the Court, the rules of the organization are burdensome or oppressive, or do not provide reasonable conditions for admission to or continuance in membership, or that the organization has acted unfairly or unjustly to any of its members in the matter of preference. vides, and that is all the quarrel my honourable friends opposite have with it-that it does not give them power to control a man politically when he enters an industrial union to seek his livelihood We know House and the country, as a whole.

Does it mean that the people of the country, as a whole, believe that preference to unionists should be given, apart from any safeguard against political oppression or political tyranny? you like he treated Judkins to-day. sional jealousy that made the Minister annoyed with M Judkins. He has no reason r to be angry with me, and I am sure his interjection was intended to throw light on the debate!

And further provided that no organization shall be entitled to appear before the Court to oppose an application for preference by any organization so long as its rules or other binding decisions permit the application of its funds to political purposes, or require its members to do anything of a political character. With that safeguard in the Act it would be impossible for the Australian Workers' Union, for instance, to fine a man ^ 3 for supporting any candidate other than the Labour candidate, if that union wanted preference. If the union did not want preference, the section would not operate. But the moment that it sought to drive men, at the peril of their livelihoods, to join its ranks, it would be stopped directing their politics, because this House held, some years ago, that the industrial liberty of those men should be safeguarded, byinsuring that their political liberty and consciences should not be harnessed to the cart of the organizers of the Australian Workers' Union. That proviso in the Act was carefully limited, in order to enable unions to carry on legitimate political propaganda, aiming purely at the alleviation of the conditions obtaining in the industry, because the Act goes on to say"" Political purposes"" in this section does not include obtaining or maintaining provisions applying to all persons in any particular industry, without discrimination as between those who are and those who are not members of an organization, with respect to the regulation of the following matters :-Preservatio n of life and limb;",43,Second Reading

Under the Act as it stands, therefore, it is conclusive to every fair-minded man that preference can be given at present to any union in Australia which can satisfy the Court that its rules are for legitimate industrial purposes, and not framed for party political ends such as honourable members opposite are so anxious to attain by passing the amending Bill now before the Chair. This is a very serious question for a large section of Australian workmen. At these periods honourable members opposite are very apt to rise in their places and tell us what an undying love they have for the man who has always stayed outside their unions. A few days ago a very benevolent gentleman, in the person of the honourable member for Darling, told this Chamber, with his hand on his heart, how he loved his brother non-unionist, and how happy he meant to make him when he joined his union. I always go to the writings of my honourable friends when I want to find out what their real views are. hold in my hand a book called Australia's Awakening, by W. G. Spence. on very thick paper, and contains very little. able member who is addressing the House. honourable friend is saying. This is what the honourable member for Darling, the President of the Australian Workers Union, has to say in this epoch-making book, recently published,' with reference to non-unionists of the Australian Workers Union? not know anything done by my honourable friend that is not. On page 90-and I direct the attention of my philanthropic friends opposite to this-the following passage occurs:Some of the unionists were great believers in right to work for the right to live of other immersion as a cure for scab. Not the immersion practised by the Postmaster-General, but another and more practical formOne experienced organizer said he had only known one case which required more than one dip. That was in Western Victoria. He was on picket duty, and caught the "" scab"" creeping across a bridge over a stream at 3 o'clock on a frosty morning. He tried moral suasionThat is a great phrase. This is the sort of "" moral suasion "" that is exercised with a brick without avail, and finally he dropped the "" scab"" from the bridge into the cold water. The poor fellow came out still loyal to his desire to oblige the employer, so he was again pushed in. He came out the second time still a hardened sinner, and after some further parley was again dipped under the cold water. He repented this time, and came out a convert to Unionism and a monument to the efficacy of cold water in judicious quantities properly applied. '' moral suasion '' ? was half drowned one cold, frosty morning by a man twice his size. This is the kind of love for the non-unionists that the honourable member for Darling and his colleagues really have in their hearts when dealing with a question of this kind. Knowing that the leaders of this. movement do have this view towards a large section of our fellow subjects, I think that it is the duty of this House, whatever I sentiment we may have towards unionism or non-unionism-and personally I have given my. sympathies in the direction of unionismhonorable member said. I cannot hear him when he speaks too loudly, nor can I hear him when he speaks too softly.. He is one of the most difficult men in the House to understand. We may have our prejudices in favour of, or against, unionism, but when we know that the leaders of the political union movement in Australia1 do not refer to the bond fide trade union movement, which is quite another thinghave this sort of tyrannical hate of the men who will not join their unions, contribute to their funds, and support their return to Parliament, it becomes all the more incumbent upon us to see that any legislation that we pass, conferring privileges, by Statute, upon a section of the community, shall be enjoyed only so long as that section does not impair the liberty and the sections of the community that we represent.

WhatI , and those who think with me, are endeavouring to do is to maintain in its purity and disinterestedness, its grandeur and simplicity, the true trade union movement of this country. We are not trying to utilize it by placing the exercise of its powers in the hands of a fewpersons supporting the present Government, to be used merely as an engine for bolstering up a party which evidently believes that it must take some such means to maintain itself in the control of the affairs of the Commonwealth. I think I have said enough to show the need of the safeguards of the principal Act. for South Sydney, until recently a member of the Arbitration Court of New South Wales, asks me to continue, and I am delighted to give him one or two further references. It is rather interesting, when dealing with a measure of this kind, to consider the tricks that may be resorted to, the points that may be taken, by unions who wish not honestly to operate under any industrial legislation! but to refuse a man admission to their ranks. It will surprise some honourable members to know that a union has had to be haled before the Arbitration Court of New South Wales because a man who wanted to join it found it impossible to* find its secretary to lodge his -..pplication for membership. I shall give honourable members a reference to one or two cases heard in the Arbitration Court of New South Wales. In volume II . , page -107, of the Industrial Arbitration Reports and Records of Neiv South Wales, we find an instance of what is likely to happen if we compel men to join unions having rules that are not merely devised for the facilitation of the work of the Federal Court. Let me refer, first of all, to this case of the Professional Musicians' Association of Australasia, and, in passing, point out that a curious feature of the organizations of my honourable friends opposite, at the present juncture, seems to be that the man who is most fitted to act as secretary of a political union is the man who does not happen to be exercising himself in the particular profession or trade to which that union relates. An erstwhile professional bicycle rider is the secretary of the Professional Musicians' Association. to say that this was a. summons under section 12 of the Industrial Arbitration Act by the secretary of the union to recover certain penalties imposed by the committee of the union against the respondent, who was a member of the union, for the infringement of two of its rules. The penalties sought to be recovered were in respect of an infringement, not of the laws of the country, but of two of the rules of the union, and the Judge, in giving his decision, saidIn this case the respondent has consented to become a member of this unionThe respondent consented in this case; he was not driven by "" preference to unionists "" to join the unionthe rules of which place this unlimited power in the hands of the committee of the union. The exercise of their discretion by the committee has been a reasonable one, a fine of 5s. only having been imposed for each breach. The breach being that he worked with a non-unionist in an orchestra !For these reasons I think. the respondent is liable to pay these penaltiesthat the secretary of that association is a professional bicycle rider; as a matter of fact, he is a musician; he is the leader of a band. injustice, and I at once accept the honourable member's statement. I knew of this man as one who was a few 5'ears ago very busy in a combine in the bicycle world. He went into a combine to obtain possession of a prize, and there was some litigation about it !

I have seen complaints against the financing of certain big unions; at any rate, of one big union in New South Wales. A short time ago there was brought to my notice a communication challenging the secretary of this great organization to test the writer's statements as regards the union's funds before a jury of his countrymen. The challenge did not emanate from an opponent of unionism, but from an ex-officer of the union itself. I suggest to my honourable friends that a thing of that sort is most undesirable in any movement, most of all in a movement where a majority of the persons interested, through having little or no knowledge of financial affairs and balancing of accounts, could ,best do with a little guarantee that the accounts are being selves, and not in the interests of a man who wants to work his way into Parliament. thing, but here is one direction in which my honourable friends can help the unionist movement in Australia. Give them a Government audit, show them that they may have confidence in the financing of their affairs. Let me now take my honourable friends a stage further. One of the most deplorable things about the arbitration law is the way in which the funds of unions are being wasted in the Courts. ago unions, as well as the Labour party, came to the conclusion that no lawyer should be allowed in the Arbitration The predominant part of a trade Court. This was undoubtedly to simplify the machinery of the Court and save legal expenses. I have great sympathy with that object. Why should any lawyer, That is a merely because he happens to be a Labour lawyer, go into the Court and earn his They would then get away unions hard-earned savings? In these cases, a Labour lawyer is in a very difficult position.. He cannot black-leg on his legal union; he must accept from his own union the legal rates whatever they are * If he were not a Labour lawyer, he could go into the Court, and say, "" I am representing my fellow-men; I a m an altruist; I am not, on this occasion, a lawyer. I put all my experience at the service of my union. I shall black-leg on the legal union, in order to help the union which occasionally is illegal,""and see it tide over its difficulties."" But what is the honourable position to-day? You find instance after instance of lawyers turning "" L a b o u r "" m order to get advantage of the I have no objection. I prejudice which is excited against the lawyer who is not ""Labour."" Having excited that prejudice, the Labour lawyers get practically all the business which is brought before the Arbitration Courtsand, as a result, the Labour lawyer is growing rapidly rich, and the Labour union rapidly poor. If my honourable friends wish to amend the Act in a direction which will help the unions of Australia, let them wipe out lawyers of all kinds-Labou r lawyers and real lawyers. Let us get rid of them all, but let us be careful not to take from any man the liberty to work. would take from the lawyer his liberty to work. . J run in the interests of themhonorable member an additional libertythe liberty to work for nothing, should he feel sufficiently philanthropic to do so, Of course, that is not a usual though I do not suggest that he personally should do anything so outrageous.

Some of the things one reads there are capable of making one's blood boil. 1 refer honourable members also to page 363 of volume III . of the Reports for 1004. In that volume is the report of a case in which a young man desiring a job as a cooper, and his employer being ready to employ him at the union rate of wages, the union, which had been awarded ' pre-1 ference,"" said that he must undergo a test before he could join the union. That was a perfectly fair demand, because in every trade the union should insist upon a standard of efficiency. But this young man was examined in coopering, not of the kind he was accustomed to do, but of a kind very rarely carried on in the neighbourhood of Sydney, and admission to the union was denied him ! He appealed to the Court, and induced it to get the union to alter its rules. Thus that sharp practice was thwarted, and I am sure all honourable members are glad that the evil was rectified. Then on page 29 of volume IV. we have anotiier instance. such cases of refusal to elect members to unions ? been connected with the Wharf Labourers' Union and the Newcastle Coal Trimmers' Union, but I have only scanned the reports. All these cases show that, without proper safeguards, the law can be used to the disadvantage of men who honestly wish to join unions to get the opportunity to earn their livelihood. No doubt the union secretariesnot the unions-ar e generally to blame. But the Attorney-General proposes to abolish the safeguards we have. He proposes that men shall be compelled to join political unions, to contribute to their on the past. We must try to improve funds, and to support the candidature of the members of his party. I think I have said enough to show that the measure which the Attorney-General introduced as "" a mere machinery B ill , "" to be forced through without discussion or deliberation, merits the close consideration and earnest scrutiny of every honourable member who industry can really afford to pay. puts the liberty' of his fellows before his personal advantage. I congratulate the honourable member for Wentworth on the able speech which he These reports has made. He has dealt with the measure so fully and forcibly that it will hot be necessary for me to express my views at any great length. I had gathered from the statements of the Attorney General, which had appeared in the press, that the amendments proposed by the Bill were technical and unimportant, and was therefore surprised on reading the Bill to discover their true nature. If they are what he says they are, what is coming in the near future, when the people have given us the right to deal as we please with industrial matters? The prospect must appal even honourable members opposite. No doubt the statements to which I allude were instances of the humour for which the Attorney-General is so justly celebrated, and the Bill contains in reality the cream of his proposals for industrial reform. Our industrial legislation is intended to prevent strikes, to which every one is opposed. This being an age of law and order, we wish to settle the differences between employers and employees with the aid of machinery which will prevent our industrial concerns from being thrown out of gear. I do not agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that an Arbitration Court is better than Wages Boards for settling industrial disputes. He says that the enormous aggregation of capital has forced the workers into unions; that in the old days a journeyman, if of a thrifty disposition, could, after three or four years, set up for himself. There is a certain amount of truth in what he says, and I , for one, greatly deplore the passing away of the old state of affairs. But we have to deal with things as they are. I often wonder whether the workers of Australia are' better off. by reason of our industrial legislation than the workers of Canada, where the laws of supply and demand have free play. However, it is useless to go back the legislation we have. In my opinion, Wages Boards are more likely than an Arbitration Court to bring about the settlement of disputes. by a Wages Board inquiry what wages an member argued that an Arbitration Court",48,Second Reading

289,Mr Fairbairn,"The honourable.has greater power for ascertaining the pro-fits of an industry than have Wages Boards. I do not think that there is much in that contention. In any case, the reasons for adopting Wages Boards outweigh those in favour of arbitration. When an investigation takes place in an Arbitration Court, witnesses have to be called. Of course, the presiding Judge is skilled"" in weighing evidence, but he has no practical acquaintance with the industry in which the dispute has arisen. point a Judge to preside over the investigations of Wages Boards. not contemplated by the Bill. Wages Board investigation under the Victorian law, the employers meet the employees face to face, and it is not necessary to call evidence. That counts greatly in favour of the Wages Board system. In an Arbitration Court the rival parties have to call their witnesses, and everybody knows what an unsatisfactory method of arriving at the truth that is. The witnesses upon both sides are biased, and, consequently, it requires a man of almost genius to ascertain where the truth actually lies. Another point which weighs in favour of the Wages Board system is that it really brings into play the essence of the system of conciliation. When the parties to a dispute drag their witnesses into Court, they practically conduct a battle, and feelings are aroused which are not easily allayed. Now, I think we all desire to see industrial peace brought about in our time. But since arbitration laws were enacted we have been very far from attaining that happy result. than it was previously. For instance, is there not more peace to-day in the shearing industry than there was formerly ? of 1891 there has been more peace in that industry. But in framing our legislation we ought to bear in mind that our chief object is to provide fair conditions of labour, so that a friendly feeling may exist between all classes of the community. That is the basis of this legislation. Are we more likely to create that friendly feeling by the establishment of a system of Wages Boards, under which the employers and employees meet, than by resort to an Arbitration Court, where a war is practically conducted as between the contending parties? Personally, i"" have always favoured the establishment of a Wages Board system as the foundation of all industrial legislation. Legislation ought to be built upon that foundation, and during the last campaign the Liberal party proposed to provide for an appeal, on certain grounds, from these industrial tribunals"" to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. In the adoption of that metiiod lies the secret of industrial peace. Buti f we continue the system of having recourse to an Arbitration Court upon every conceivable occasion, we shall have anything but peace. Under this Bill it is proposed to bring all Government servants other than railway employees within the operation of our ConciliaIn a tion and Arbitration Act. The High Court has already held that railway employees -cannot be so included. I fail to see how such a provision can lead to anything but another industrial dispute, another law case, in which great costs will be incurred upon both sides, and in which it will finally be laid down that it is ultra vires of the Constitution. I feel certain that before effect can be given to any such proposal our Constitution will require to be amended. The basic principle of all industrial legislation is that the employer-havin g command of the purse-possesse s an undue advantage over the employee, and that as he desires to make as much profit as he can out of his industry, he is naturally disposed to grind down the employee. To provide against such a tendency, this class of legislation has been introduced. But we must recollect that the relations which exist between the Government of a country and its servants are different from those which exist between an ordinary employer and his employees. The public servant has the protection of the representatives of the people, and the workers constitute the great majority of the people. Therefore, the representatives of the public servants really fix the wages and lay down the conditions to be observed by those servants. I cannot help thinking that that safeguard in itself ought to be sufficient, without bringing Government employees under the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

293,Mr Fairbairn,"Sinc e the big strikevery ill-advised. I trust that that portion of the Bill will not be pressed. I repeat that the relationship which exists between a Government and its employees is entirely different from that which exists between the ordinary employer and his employees. The Government do not expect to make profits by sweating their servants or by treating them illiberally. I cannot help thinking that the public servants enjoy the fullest protection from their masters by reason of the fact that they have their representatives ih Parliament to safeguard their interests. It is also proposed that the principal Act shall be made to apply to domestic servants. In the past I feel sure that the domestic servant has not experienced, by any means, a good time. But during recent years conditions have altered a great deal, so .that to-day domestics hold the thick end of the stick. An enormous demand exists for their services, so that they are in a position to command their own terms. They are practically mistresses of the situation. If we really intend to make this provision efficient, we shall require an army of inspectors to insure that proper conditions are being observed in regard to the employment of domestics. We can scarcely imagine the privacy of a man in the bosom of his family being suddenly invaded by an inspector bent upon ascertaining what sort of a time the domestic was experiencing. Under such circumstances an Englishman's house would no longer be* his castle. spector was sent into a trade union meeting. honourable member thinks as I do. I hope that he will support me when I move an amendment in favour of exempting domestic servants from the operation of the Bill. I presume that the desire is to make the measure effective. Already we have far too many laws which are absolutely inoperative, and, therefore, perfectly useless. These laws simply cumber the statute-book, and nobody pays any attention to them. trade unionists under those obsolete laws in the old davs. greatly changed since that state of affairs prevailed. We are now trying to prevent trade unionists from gaoling the rest of us. If this law is to be operative, it must be enforced. There must be inspectors to see that it is carried out. Consequently, the police must have access to every house in the country. Many of the "" bobbies "" are my friends, but I do not think I should like the idea of a policeman coming into my house at any hour of the day in order to see hqw the domestics were being treated. had a good-looking cook, he could not keep the policeman out! that I am getting honourable members opposite to realize what a ludicrous farce this proposal is. It would be impossible to carry out such a law. What is the use of putting it on the statute-book if it cannot be enforced? But, of course, the intention is simply to catch votes. We quite see what it means. Honourable members opposite will be able to tell the domestic servants what fine fellows they are, how they have looked after their interests, and what a splendid time they are going to have. For my own part, I dunk they have a pretty good time now. Honourable members may take it from me that the domestic servants have hold of the big end of the stick. A domestic servant is practically the mistress nowadays j and perhaps it is a good job that that should be"" so. Another large class of employees that 4t is desired to bring under the arbitration law consists of those engaged in agricultural, viticultural, horticultural, and dairying pursuits. The application of a law of this kind to what, we may call local industries involves making a great change in principle. It means applying the law to industries which have to compete with similar industries in the markets of the world. If , as the result of this legislation, wages are fixed at a higher scale than is paid by our competitors, shall we not imperil our rural industries or bring them down altogether? That is a point that ought to be kept seriously in mind. Are we going to unduly handicap our farmers in competing with farmers in Canada or the Argentine ? Of course, it may be urged that if this class of legislation is applied in towns and cities, there is no reason why it should not be applied in the country also. There is, I must admit, a good deal fo Things have be said from that point of view.

I believe that if unions are moderately conducted they will gradually increase their membership, and men imbued with the proper spirit will join them in good time without the passing of a drastic measure of this kind. The idea of this legislation is, of course, to drive men into unions whether they like it or not. I know a great many men who are really against joining unions. I do not know why it is. favour by saying that kind of thing. fact, I do not think they do. The honourable member must regard them as a very low class of people if he believes they are influenced by such a motive. knows them as well as I do. orable member that I do not know men of the class to which he refers. I believe that the proper conduct of unions will be far more likely to bring about an increase In the number of unionists than an attempt to make every worker in the community join a union. The honourable member for Wentworth made it plain that under the legislation now proposed, a man must join a union, if he is permitted to do so, or lie must cease to exist. His right to work is his right to live, and if you take away his right to work, you take away 'his right to live. But the Bill goes further than this, and after compelling men to join unions by enforcing the principle of preference, the funds of the unions are to be permitted to be used for political purposes. This does seem to me to be a most extraordinary proposal. Honourable members opposite desire to compel every worker in the community to join a union and contribute to its funds, and then, whether he approves or not, to permit the union to use the money he has contributed to support a particular brand of candidate. Is not that a most extraordinary interference with the liberty of the subject? ballot-box around with every kind of secrecy. inviolable. have the right to vote in the way in which he thinks best, and yet honourable members opposite propose to compel certain members of the community to provide funds for the support of Labour candidates.

Federation supply candidates with funds? objection to the members of a Labour union contributing voluntarily to the support of any candidate they please, but I see great objection to compelling a man to join a union and then using his contributions to support something of which he does not approve. I consider that nothing short of an outrage. Under this Bill the funds of a union might be devoted to promote something which many of my Labour unionist friends dislike intensely. Very many trade unionists are intensely opposed to Socialism. If the object of honourable members opposite is to make all trade unionists Socialists, I can assure them that it will take them some generations to effect their purpose, if they ever succeed in doing so. will try it.

322,Mr Fairbairn,"A statement of people reared upon principles of liberty. It has been our birth right, and we will not easily surrender it. It only needs the passing of a few more measures like the precious Bill before us to bring about an upheaval in this country such as we have never seen the like of. I do not say that the protest will come from the capitalistic class; it will come from the workers themselves. They are becoming tired of the continual grinding down methods of the unions. Do honourable members opposite think for a moment that they do not value freedom just as much as we do? Coming from a good old Anglo-Saxon stock they love it quite as much as we do, and will not readily surrender it. The effect of placing a few more measures like this upon the statute-book will be to put our friends opposite in a place from which they will not be likely to return for many a day. The debate so far has proved conclusively that the House generally is in favour of organized unionism based On fair principles. We are indebted to the Leader of the Opposition for a statement of the importance of the amendments of the principal Act proposed by this Bill, which caused the consideration of the measure to be postponed until honourable members had a better opportunity to study it. The Bill deals with two important principles o.f unionism. It proposes to remove the provision of the principal Act exempting from its operation . the workers in the primary industries, and it makes provision for preference to unionists. These are provisions which caused the downfall of two Governments, and around which a great deal of discussion .took place when the Bill, now the principal Act, was before the House. The Bill before us also lays down a new basis for arbitration. The Attorney-General, in quoting the Chief Justice of the High Court, laid down the basis of arbitration as not only the interests of unions and employers, but the interest of society in the peaceful conduct of industrial affairs. I think we are all agreed that the objects aimed at in the principal Act are such as should appeal to every honourable member who desires to see peace and progress mainmember include wool? tained, and a continuance of good feeling between all engaged in industrial operations. The principal Act aims at preventing the wool trade. ihi strikes by conciliation and arbitration, at extending the jurisdiction of the Court for the purposes of amicable settlement of disputes, and, in default of settlement, giving the Court power to enforce its award; at enabling disputes to be carried to the Court, and facilitating and encouraging organization and representation. It will be generally conceded that, while in some respects these objects have been attained, most of the provisions have not been operative. For instance, the Act has not succeeded in preventing disputes by means of conciliation. It is provided in the Bill that the power of the President shall be extended to conciliation that may prevent disputes before the Court is called on to exercise its jurisdiction, and that there shall be appointed a Board of Reference to settle differences before they amount to real disputes; and these, in my opinion, are objects both worthy of our consideration. WhatI purpose dealing with to-night are the two important amendments proposed, namely, the inclusion oi domestic servants and workers engaged in rural industries, and preference to unionists. As the representative of a district which includes agriculture, horticulture, and dairying amongst its industries, I may say that my constituents view with considerable apprehension the proposal to include rural workers. It was pointed out this afternoon, with considerable force and ability by the honourable member for Richmond, that this will prove very dangerous ; and I , myself, believe that it will prove seriously inimical to the best interests of the agricultural and horticultural industries. There ought to be a means of dealing with disputes between employers and employed in some branches of our primary industries; but a system which proposes to deal with the employees in a uniform way over the whole of the continent, notwithstanding all the differences in climate and conditions, will, in my opinion, cause incalculable injury. At the present time the,total annual production of Australia is valued at ,£164,000,000, of which £99,000,000 is directly derived from primary productions. Our export trade last year was £62,000,000, of which nearly £40,000,000 represented products of the primary industries. about £20,000,000 as representing the wool exported.

327,Mr Sampson,"I have includednearly two-thirds of the export trade of Australia is in primary productions, the prices of which are fixed in the markets of the world, and over which the local producers have, in fact, really no control. The exports of Australia are such an infinitesimal percentage of the total that they have little or no influence in fixing prices abroad. It is a pure question of supply and demand. the case of wool, and that is a big item. portion, of the wool is, I know, bought locally. In the case of our manufacturing industries we have the opportunity, through Customs duties, to give adequate protection; we can, as it were, watch the raw material through the various stages of its manufacture until the finished article is placed in the hands of the consumer or user, and can protect it at each stage; but there is no such opportunity in connection with the export trade. Any attempt to regulate the export trade, by means of a Court of Arbitration operating uniformly over the whole of Australia, must prove a serious drawback to the primary producing industries, on which rests the ultimate prosperity of the country. to take less. man? where he is. man in the export trade?

Another important phase of the question is connected with land settlement. Encouragement of our primary production can only take place under a proper .system of settlement. member intend to connect that with the question before the Chair? that I believe that primary production can best be promoted by a system of land settlement which encourages family effort in every possible way. I believe that stability in production and stability in our national life are based, to a large extent, on family effort, and if we are to have an arbitration system which may possibly cause certain members of the family to be brought under the clause which provides for preference to unionists, it will be a very serious handicap to the future of our agricultural, horticultural, and dairying industries. The question of bringing' under the control of the Arbitration Act the employees in the primary industries cannot be dealt with in a way that will mete out even reasonable justice to those industries under our present Con1 stitution, if it is desired that the Federal Parliament shall regulate wages and hours of labour in them. If the Government, with their present majority, are determined to regulate all the primary and secondary industries, it is only reasonable that they should wait for the verdict of the people in respect of the proposed amendments of the Constitution which they promise to submit to the electors at a very early date. The only way to deal with the primary industries is according to locality and conditions of production, and, in present circumstances, that can best be done under a system of Wages Boards, such as we have in Victoria. Any attempt to deal with them under the Arbitration Act as it now stands, or as it is sought to be amended, will be a serious blow to the foundational aspects of Australian production. Wages Boards for those employees, seeing that the Legislative Councils control the legislation of the States. present there is a big movement going on in the Victorian Parliament to extend the Wages Board system to a considerable number of additional industries. I have very little doubt that if the same energy were put by the Labour party and the Liberal party into an endeavour to bring about a complete system of regulation of wages and industrial conditions within the States, as is being displayed by the labour unions in their desire to bring about a system of unification, we should soon have an extension of the Wages Boards principle to nearly every important industry in the Commonwealth.",54,Second Reading

Of course, we know that. But do free men and free women desire to have shackles placed upon themselves? What does freedom mean? free for-to take a low wage? member is not a free man. He cannot talk, because he signed tlie pledge. When tiie representative of a country electorate comes here with his hands tied and his legs shackled, he is no longer a free man; he must support the measure which has been approved in caucus. members on the other side want to make every man a slave to their party. I ask the Government to agree to the suggestion of the honourable member for Richmond, as it will afford to them an opportunity to revery interesting, but I claim that the matframe the Bill. I hope that, on further consideration, the preference clause will be dropped. The honourable member for Wimmera has just stated that, according to the latest return, there are 153,000 unionists in the Commonwealth. Now, is a minority of the people to dominate the majority? Is there to be freedom in our midst, or are we to have tyrannous rule by a minority? My honourable friends on the other side have the numbers, and, therefore, they can carry this measure if they please. No doubt we are only beating the air; but I want honourable members to realize that country representatives, and people generally, do not want to be shackled, or to lose their freedom. What do we, as Britishers, pride ourselves on? We pride ourselves on our freedom. Do we want to give our freedom away? Is it to be taken from us by a minority of the people? Are my honourable friends opposite going to coerce every one to enter their unions? One of them interjected a little while ago that that was their object. We know that it is. But did the electors send them here for that purpose? So far as I know, preference to unionists was not mentioned during the elections. I , for one, did not hear a reference to it. on the party's manifesto. In Victoria, done very little. The ideal of the Labour there was a platform published. Pracparty is not only shorter hours of labour tically, it said that all those who would with higher rates of pay, but no work bevote for labour would vote for congenial tween meals, and that is why we find prefriends want to provide the congenial em-' ployment. They want the millennium. If this measure is carried, there ought to be a provision enacted to the effect that every person who joins a union shall wear a label or a cypher on a conspicuous portion of his clothing to indicate that he has lost his freedom and is shackled. It is only right and proper that it should be done, because, otherwise, a man would be "" blacklegging."" My honourable friends opposite do not approve of "" blacklegs."" In fact, I heard an honourable member speak about scabs a while ago. My honourable friends heard what the honourable member for Wentworth said. They heard about a political labour immersion, which was quoted Honourable from a most estimable work by the honourable member for Darling. They do not want free labourers. remarks of the honourable member may be ter which he is now discussing has nothing to do with the Bill. able member's point of order? orable member is out of order in discussing the badges which unionists should wear or the immersion of men in water. ber is trying to show why preference should not be given to unionists.

It is only right and proper that every unionist should be required by law to wear a label on a conspicuous part of his clothing, in order to show that he is a member of a union. It is only reasonable that he should show the public that he has signed away his freedom, and become a slave to a political party. who is getting a living wage. men getting a living wage?

My honourable friends on the other side have alleged that I was a sweater, although I was a primary producer, in fact, that I was anything and everything. I am now addressing the House, as a primary producer, as one who has cultivated his own land for many years. I may be told by honourable members on the other side that I know nothing about the work or about the situation and conditions of life of the farmer. By his apathy, or his neglect, or his ininterests of the country for the benedifference, the farmer is largely responsible for the advent of the Labour party to power, but I think that he will prove to its members a little later that he does not appreciate their work here. He is the man upon whom all consumers must depend. It is upon the success of his industry that the prosperity and development of this great country depend. Surely the Labour party will realize that he is not a man to be taxed out of existence. Even though he failed in his duty to this side of the House on election day, he is getting his gruel now, and he will pay for it a little later. I do not think that he will rejoice at first, but if he awakens to a sense of his responsibility and of the value of manhood suffrage, and learns that he must exercise his vote at the next election, the triumph of the Labour party will have done good. tion was the largest ever polled. per cent, of the electors of Victoria voted. That was not enough to satisfy me. member to connect his remarks with the Bill. Attorney-General will consider the amendment which has been moved, not from a party stand-point, but in the interests of the Commonwealth. The people of Australia do not desire preference to unionists; they do not wish to sign away their freedom, and to .be coerced into joining unions. The Labour party has a duty to perform, and no doubt will perform it according to its lights; but its members should study the national, as well as their own party, interests. What they propose is to increase their political power by means of coercion. I hope that the amendment will be carried. The Attorney-General will do well if he consents to an adjournment of the debate, so that the Government may think over the proposal. It will do justice to a very large number of supporters in the country if it expunges the provision which gives preference to unionists. I could not help thinking, while listening to the debate this afternoon, that any wellinformed and impartial person hearing it without knowing that a proposed amendment of an Arbitration Act was being discussed, would hardly have thought that the possibility of regulating die fit of all classes was being debated from two points of view. The two sides of this question have been represented in a way which might lead one to suppose that capital and labour, in their co-operative effort at production, are absolutely inimical. I have always held the view that their proper attitude is one of compromise, and that everything should be done to promote peace and goodwill between them. In reviewing this measure, and in considering the different aspects of the larger measure which it is intended to amend, I cannot help recalling the circumstances of this State twenty-five years ago, when, in the Trades Hall of this city, I took a very prominent part in settling disputes between labour and capital. I was, at the time, managing a very large business, here. The irritation caused by the trade unionists of Victoria was so great, and their interference related to matters so trifling, that the employers resolved to organize on the same lines as those adopted by trade .unionists. The result was the establishment of the Employers' Union, which was the beginning of the present Employers' Federation. I had the honour to be its president for two years. That union became very powerful"". It represented at first £7,000,000 of capital, and afterwards £27,000,000. Its power became so impressive that the Trades Hall Council came out with the white flag, and asked for a conference, with a view to ending the constant bickering and friction between capital and labour. I was chosen a delegate by the Employers' Union to meet delegates from the Trades Hall. In conference, we arrived at the conclusion that it was possible to establish a system of voluntary arbitration, and thus to end the constant irritation between the two necessary elements of production. For nearly three months, off and on, I sat with leading members of the Trades Hall Council engaged in framing a constitution for that Board of Conciliation. We provided",58,Second Reading

I wish to say that in any observations which I may offer, I am r.o more animated by a bias in favour of the capitalist than by a bias in favour of ihe employees. I endeavour to look at this question from the economic, the industrial, and the national stand-point. I should be delighted if we could hit upon oOine method by which the relationship between capital and labour could be put upon a basis of friendship instead of upon one of enmity. I am sure that as time goes on this desire on the part of the stronger side to impose its own terms upon the weaker will be destructive of the productive powers of the country, and will interfere largely with our opportunities of competing in the markets of the world.

I am not a politician who gret to say that I have observed on the part boasts that he does not read die newsof honourable members of the Labour party indications of a belief that whatever may be Labour journals. placed upon our statute-book is morally right. It is a tenet which seems to be held all through the country, and especially amongst the working classes. To give an extreme instance of the fallacy of this doctrine, I have only to state that if the Labour party had a sufficient majority it could legislate in favour of the complete confiscation of private property. I know that such an idea would not be entertained by the thoughtful members of that party, but nevertheless my honourable friends would be in a position to do that. If they had a majority in both Houses of this Parliament they could practically consides of the question. I read both daily fiscate all the wealth of this country. But would they think for a moment that it would be morally right for them to do so? They might legislate to legalize even highway robbery if they thought it right. that we are right. friends may think so, because they have the power. honourable member does not consider that power is synonymous with right I am satisfied with him. But a practice is growing up in the Labour party-judgin g by the wild way in which some of its members talk of what should be done, and what could be done-of viewing any law which is placed upon the statute-book as if a moral justification existed for it. Is the House at the present time in a position-havin g regard to the party ties which exist upon the other side of the 0 Chamber-to impartially decide what is just between employer and employee?

But I read it myself, because I consider myself sufficiently proof against its doctrines. I mention this fact with a view to showing that I am quite impartial. For some years I subscribed to the whole of the Labour journals, because I wanted to read both newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne, besides other journals which give me both points of view. I do so, not from idle curiosity, but because I desire to know what the other side has to say. The assumption on the part of my honourable friends opposite that everything which proceeds from this side of the Chamber is necessarily coloured by a bias in favour of capital is an absolutely unsound one. There are honourable members on this side of the House-and I do not name them, because I do not wish to be invidious-wh o are just as public spirited as are honourable members opposite, and who have no desire to twist or turn any of the arguments with regard to any particular measure merely to suit the point of view of the capitalist.

I agree with the Leader of the Opposition mat we ought, on a matter of this sort, to endeavour to meet the views of the Government in regard to the order of business so far as we can, so long as we do not lose any substantial rights of debate. For that reason I acceded, by interjection, to what the Leader of the Opposition said, but I suggest that we shall be nearer to the discussion of the whole matter if we deal with the principal proposition first. [10.17] -I "" reply, I have to say that this is undoubtedly a complementary and supplementary Bill. It is an essential part of the policy, and the two measures are so linked together that they cannot properly be discussed separately. It would.have been possible to have both proposals in the same Bill, but the much more sensible and straightforward way is to have two Bills, even though that should cause the Government more trouble. I shall do nothing to embarrass discussion, but, on the contrary, do everything possible to afford the widest scope within reason. This is an important and far-reaching proposal in its character and consequence, but it is by no means new or novel. A similar measure has been introduced in a sister Parliament in Australia in practically the same way, and with no dire results. I , therefore, ask the Opposition to see the Bill, and I say again, that the Government will afford every opportunity for the examination of both measures, though the principal one is taken first. The Government feel bound, under any circumstances, to press this proposal forward, but at this early stage I have no desire to come into conflict with the Opposition in any way. My desire is to leave the matter open to fair and temperate discussion, which I hope will be productive of good, not only to the members of this House, but to the people of Australia. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported, and report,' by leave, adopted. OrderedThat Mr Fisher and Mr Hughes do prepare and bring in a B ill to carry out the foregoing resolution. a first time. House adjourned at 10.20 p.m. [35]",64,Naval Loan Repeal Bill
