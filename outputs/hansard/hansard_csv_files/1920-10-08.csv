""When the Bill was before the Committee, I promised the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) that I would intimate as soon as possible the considered decision of the Government with respect to his proposal to bring within tlie scope of the Bill all those classes that were very close to the border line of war service.

I agree with the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster)* when he suggests that we do not want the detailed information that is supplied in certain reports, and that the Department cannot have much to do when it compiles such elaborate particulars. It may be thought, however, that the Parliament desires all this information. Wheni t was proposed that the War Service Homes Commissioner should present an annual report of the operations of his mills, the Minister said that he might be compelled under such a provision to supply information which would be of stocks are concerned that might be so. Finding from his report that his stock of certain material was low his competitors might be inclined to raise the price of that material.

[11.14] -The various activities under Government control are subjected to constant criticism in this House and outside of it, and comparisons are continually being made between public and private enterprises to the detriment of the former. For From the same quarter that these criticisms as to want of economy on the part of public enterprises emanate, comes a continual request that public enterprises should be handicapped by having to support a. staff of accountants and actuaries in order that they may supply to the Parliament detailed information of their operations.

18,Mr Hector Lamond (Illawarra),"cost of these staffs is debited against the enterprise. While it is necessary that the Parliament should be fully informed as to the working of all Government undertakings, the fact that we impose upon them heavy expenditures, which are not undertaken by private enterprise conducting the same work, should bd home in mind. aggrieved by what the War Service Homes Department is doing, the country is to be put to the expense of, it may be, £10,000 to carry out an exhaustive investigation. I venture upon the very dangerous ground of prophecy, and say that when the report of the Public Accounts Committee on its present inquiry is received it will be found that the whole of the money spent upon it will have teen absolutely wasted. These charges are always made when, some one in business secures an advantage over some one else. In connection with this particular matter I direct special attention to the fact that in order that this inquiry may be carried out the head of the War Service Homes Department, and probably other officials, will be tied to the Committee, it may be for months, when they ought to be carrying on the enterprise which has been intrusted to them. A little later the same critics will come along and say that the War Service Homes Commission has failed, and if that be so it will have failed, not because of any inherent defect in the control by the Government of such an enterprise, but because the War Service Homes Commissioner will have been taken away from the work which, if he were the manager of a nrivate,concern, he would be doing, in order that he might be dragged around at the heels of a committee of inquiry. I endorse the objection of the Leader of the Onnosition ( Mr Tudor) to the furnishing of these elaborate detailed reports. Their preparation necessitates the employment of a number of clerks, and they are utterly useless so far as any supervision which this Parliament is able to exercise concerned. at least a dozen double pages in the report I mentioned containing as much detail as the two pages to which I have referred. Mr ffector Lamond. of clerks are to have access to documents in order to inform Parliament that ""one bib"" has been manufactured for some one by a Government factory. The thing is absolutely ridiculous, and involves a great deal of unnecessary expense. A t this time, when economy of expenditure Because some persons are is asked for, we might save a little by doing away with a number of useless reports which, after they are presented to this Parliament, are thrown into the waste-paper basket. [1.1.IS] -We are getting two illustrations of the desire of some honourable members opposite to interfere with the conduct of public enterprises, with the, object of discrediting everything undertaken by the Government, and in order to justify their preference for private enterprise. debate now? We have the Senate's amendment before us. the Senate's amendment, and I do not; think that we should accept it, but I should like to refer to another matter first. The work of the War Service Homes Commission is continually being interfered with by certain honorable members, and the intention is to discredit it, because it has fought and beaten a lot of combines in Australia. That is its greatest fault. I agree with the honourable member who has just sat down that the investigation into the pur' chase of the timber mills will delay the work of the War Service Homes Department, and it will then be said that the building of the homes should have been let by contract, when they would have been completed more quickly. There is another phase of the question to which I should like to refer. It appears to me that the time is not far distant when the Senate will be the House that will control everything, if the Goover these enterprises is vernment persist in their present practice. If some proposal is not correctly expressed in legislation submitted here, the Government wait until it reaches the Senate, and permit that House to alter it.

I am prepared to support the .amendment, because I believe honourable members should be given the fullest in formation concerning these enterprises. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) directed attention to the reports of the operations of the Cordi t e Factory and the Harness and Saddlery Factory.

The raport includes some very interesting items, such as a reference to ""one ball puncher"" and ""one canvas stretcher, 10s."" There is not a person in any honourable member's constituency who worries himself over items of this character. The honourable members who have instigated these amendments have done so w it h a view to providing themselves with material for attacking the Government in regard to the establishment of these enterprises. It is a remarkable fact that Commonwealth factories which were established during the rSgime of the Labour Government, and which have done such splendid work for the country, have been continued and extended by succeedI wish to say that I ing Governments. I assure those honourable members who are so desirous of damaging all Government enterprises that they will not achieve anything I cannot understand for a single through having induced the Senate to make this amendment. It must be admitted that the expenditure in connection with the Clothing and Harness and Saddlery Factories has been justified, and that they played a great part in enabling Australian soldiers to make such a good showing on the other side of the world. I would be better pleased if honourable members would exercise their abilities in forwarding the progress of Australia. I do not impute motives. rather than in raising these trumpery questions. This amendment involves the appointment of a greater staff, and as a member of one of the Standing ComT h e honourable mittees of this Parliament, I have learned that much of the expense in connection with one Government enterprise is due to the excessive number of officials. Are honourable members aware that the A u d itor-General has inquired into the expenditure of all these Government enterprises? No doubt the activities in connection with War Service Homes will likewise be subject to his review. Owing to a recent increase in his -powers, the Auditor-General will be able to investigate ^these operations in greater detail than previously. I have every confidence in him and his officers.

Before1 sit down I shall move the amendment of which the honourable member for West Sydney has given notice. The Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Groom) has courteously provided me with a Hansard proof of his second-reading speech on this measure. I If the Government understand that one amendment which this Bill makes in the principal Act is to render it unnecessary for all the Justices of the High Court to be present when an appeal is made upon a constitutional question. Judges concurring shall be sufficient. ""Under tlie Judiciary Act which was passed by this Parliament in 1912 it is provided that a Full Court, consisting of less than all the Justices, shall not give a decision upon any question affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealtli unless a majority of the Justices concur in the decision. I take it that under this Bill unless three Justices agreeI prefer the word "" agree "" to the word "" concur,"" because the man in the street understands it bettera deciI think the Gosion will not be given. In looking through the measure I thought at first that it meant that three Judges had to concur or agree with the Chief Justice or the senior presiding Judge. Willi t be possible under this Bill for three Judges out of the seven to hear an appeal on a constitutional question, and, if they are unanimous, to give a decision? for a minority of the Judges of the High Court to give decisions of a far-reaching character. A judgment was given by the High Court the other day which, according to newspaper reports, seriously affects the position of the States. The next day I the Government on the matter, but we have not yet been favoured with it. If I understand the decision rightly, it makes this Parliament paramount. the particular point at issue.

83,Mr Groom,"It is only a judgment onquestion was whether the Commonwealth Court had power to give an award in a ease in which State industries were affected. The Argus, which professes to be the greatest constitutional authority among the newspapers in this State, said that the judgment upset the previous decision of the High Court in the case of D'Emden v. Pcdder, which was the determining case so far as taxation is concerned. A layman is not fitted, owing to his lack of training, to argue matters of this kind, and that was one reason why I wanted the Bill postponed until the honourable member for West Sydney, who has had the advantage of a legal training, returned. I notice that of the seven Judges of the High Court, Mr Justice Powers is away. He tice Isaacs is also going away on twelve months' leave of absence. Some honourable members, and also some people outside, are commenting on the fact that while a public servant, after twenty years' service, is allowed only six months' furlough, a Judge who has been on the Bench for only fourteen years is able to obtain leave of absence for twelve months. Personally, of course, Mr Justice Isaacs aud myself are the greatest friends, and I am sure that he will understand that I am not speaking in a hostile spirit against him, or any of the other Judges of the High Oourt. When he is away, there will still be only six Judges available. The arbitration cases require the continuous presence of Mr Justice Higgins, and we know that Mr Justice Starke has also been taking Public Service arbitration cases, which have occupied the bulk of his time. He has sat not only on holidays and at night, but during week-ends, in order to help to clear off the great congestion of business in the Arbitration Court. In addition, this House has deliberately placed a further burden on the Court, because the amending Arbitration Bill requires at least three Judges to be on .the Bench to deal with any case affecting the standard hours in an industry. An important point that must be borne in mind is that this week an amendment was carried in the Arbitration Bill whioh will probably force three-fourths of the unions of Australia out of the Court. Some honourable members did not think it would have such a far-reaching effect. "" signing-on "" amendment ? Mr Holloway, whom I look upon as one of the most reliable men in connection with the trade union movement. He can speak with a great amount of authority; and he assures me that practically not one union will agree to amend its rules in the direction required by the amendment which the Senate included in the Bill. It is, therefore, quite possible that what was done the other night will wipe out the whole of the work of the Arbitration Oourt. If it has that effect, I shall be very sorry. I voted against it, and urged the House to do so. I know that the unions feel very strongly on the matter. They will not go to the Arbitration Court if they are compelled to alter their rules. If they are compelled to break away from the Court by that amendment, there will be very few arbitration cases, and not many Judges will be required there. This may help us over the difficulty of obtaining a Full Court Bench; but it may also land Australia in further difficulties from an industrial point of view by creating industrial unrest. I shall not attempt to forecast what may happen; but I am very much afraid of the result of the action taken by Parliament this week. The Minister( Mr Groom) said in his second-reading speech on this Bill that, in 1915, the Judiciary Bill was amended at the instance of a member of the Opposition. I suppose he meant a member of the then Opposition. The records show that the Bill was introduced by the present Prime Minister. Since then there has been a complete re-shuffle of parties in this Parliament. The amendment inserted at that time was that "" This Act shall remain in operation during the present war, aud for six months thereafter, and for no longer.""

Then its shareholders were called together and told by the directors, "" We intend to give to every holder of two shares in the company an additional share."" In that way the capital was nominally increased from £30,000 to £45,000. race-course is honest compared with some of the company promoters, who pretend that they are paying profits upon a capital of £45,000, when only £30,000 has been flourished. It paid to its shareholders dividends of 10 per cent., with occasional bonuses of from 2 to 2^ per cent. average man in the street does not understar d how he is being taken down by the.o companies.

Thus there was a larger amount represented by watered stock than by cash. The capital invested in existing companies totalled £20,653,253, of whicli £14,677,424 represented cash, £5,430,960 capital by transfer of reserves and undivided profits, and £544,869 capital by transfer of assets other than cash.

When I occupied the position of Minister for Trade and Customs, and manufacturers were seeking an increased measure of Protection, I had a schedule of questions prepared which I thought they were entitled to answer. I wanted to know, for example, what quantities of Australian goods were used in the production of their articles.

I also asked the manufacturers what proportion of the cost of their finished articles was absorbed in wages.

I have quoted statistics to show that the amount represented by wages in the production of £100 worth of goods in Australia is steadily becoming less.

We all know that, although the Commonwealth steamers have been very profitable to their owners, namely, the people of Australia, they have been highly profitable specifically to. the producers in keeping down freight rates. But for the Commonwealth having a fleet of vessels ex-porting our wheat would havo been in finitely higher than it was.

In reply to a question by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), I said, on Tuesday last, that, as f a r as oversea cargoes were concerned, we were allowing the increase. Those would be completed transactions in respect of each charter. In regard to coal sold inside the Commonwealth, during the past fortnight that commodity has been sold on the understanding that whatever price the Tribunal might fix, should be paid by the buyer to the vendor. I am now in possession of a report from the Chairman of the Royal Commission to the effect that the Commissioners recommend an increase of 4s. per ton in the selling price of New South Wales coal, within the Commonwealth, fro m Monday, the 27th September, pending further inquiry and final report. As the matter is one which permits of no delay, and since this is not a final report, I bring the particulars before the Housei n order that it may express its opinion ""now, or suspend judgment-if it please-unti l an opportunity shall have been afforded it to deal with the final report. This is an interim report and recommendation which w ill enable trade to be carried on pending further and more complete inquiry as to the effect of the increase in wages upon the cost of production. It is proposed by the Government to issue an order today in pursuance of the Commission's recommendation, and I have made use of this, the very earliest, opportunity of 'taking the House into my confidence so that honourable members may know exactly where we stand. The public will be informed that the price of coal will be increased as from the 27th September, which was the day on which the decision concerning wages was made, but that this is not necessarily the final price. That has still to be finally determined. The facts are quite clear, and, so far pick upon this commodity, and say that as I know, there is no reason to doubt the world's parity shall not apply thereto that the increa.se in price is amply warwhile, in regard to other things, one ranted by the added cost of production. should, hold that the world's parity shall The recommendation does not apply to apply. coal produced outside of New South Wales.

Ninety-five per cent, of the coal produced in Victoria is got from the State mines at Wonthaggi and Morwell. affected in this way: All coal hewed in the Commonwealth from the 27th September is sold upon the condition that the price to be paid there for shall be the price which the Tribunal w ill u l t i mately fix. If 1,000 tons of Wonthaggi coal is sold, to any party whatever, that party must buy it at a price hereafter to be determined by the Tribunal. That has hitherto been the case in regard to New South Wales coal. It is now to be announced that the price for New South Wales coal shall be 4s. in excess of what it was formerly, namely, 17s. 9d. at Newcastle. I may add that I consider this price quite reasonable. I need hardly remind honourable members that our coal is still incomparably the cheaipest in the world.

That is world's parity. What does the Prime Minister consider world's parity? it is. honourable gentleman did. in regard to wheat. All I know is that we are selling coal now within 600 miles of Newcastle-on-Tyne at a lower cost than that at which English coal can be sold. That is the best answer I can give the honourable member. We are selling coal at Genoa, Marseilles, Copenhagen, and Christiania more cheaply than British coal can be sold at those places. We cannot afford to do that. We are selling the wealth of Australia; and the position is absurd. Sitting the adjournment, the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) made a brief ment concerning the proposed increase in the price of coal, and I regret that at the moment he is not present, because I do not want it to be understood that honourable members on this side of the Chamber acquiesce in the arrangement that has been made. anything that has borne out the arguments which I put forward this morning in connection with another B ill , concerning the need for further information, it is the fact that the price of coal is to be increased as from the 27th September by 4s. per ton. We understand, of course, that the increase has been made retrospective to the date mentioned, because that is the date on whioh the men received an increase in wages; but I believe the people of Australia w ill desire further information before they w ill admit that the increase in the price is justified. I am not saying that the workers are not entitled to an increase, or that the coal proprietors are not justified in obtaining a higher rate; but it must not be overlooked I thank the honourable that we are producing approximately As usual, I am guilty of 11,000,000 tons of coal, and of that quantity 10,000,000 tons are consumed in Australia. The average export of coal is, therefore, approximately 1,000,000 tons, and the increase in price w ill be on the whole of that quantity as well as on the 10,000,000 tons consumed in Australia. This is a matter of vital concern to the people of ] ' do not know what the Commonwealth. Much of the coal consumed in the CommonAvealth is used by manufacturing concerns, as the quantity consumed for domestic purposes is comparatively small. The increase menI tried to explain it tioned w ill mean that £2,200,000 extra w ill have to be paid to the coal proprietors. It must be remembered that the increase is to apply only to New South Wales coal. I understand that the Wonthaggi and Morwell mines, both Government concerns, w ill not be permitted to increase their price of coal to the consumer; at least, for the present. They may be able to increase the price, and make it retrospective; but a f a i r l y large quantity w ill have been sold and consumed before that is done. A Royal suspended from 1.2 to 2.15 p.m. Commission has been inquiring into the coal industry in New South Wales, and I remember quite recently submitting some statefigures showing the enormous increase there has been in the dividends paid by the coal companies, as disclosed by the investigations of that Commission.

140,Mr Brennan (Batman) ;[2.2d],"as an indication that it is f a u l t y in construction, difficult of interpretation, or, worse still, difficult of administration. I do not think that that, is a correct view, because any Act which is much used is likely to require amendment from time to time,, irrespective of how perfectly it may be drafted or how useful it may be. The Judiciary Act has not been often amended, and that is a tribute to the person who drafted the original measure. The present amendment is very brief; it is one to which I offer no objection. to. be regretted that the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Groom) was unwilling or unable to allow the consideration of this B ill to stand over u n t i l the sponsor of the very important amendment, of which notice had been given, had an opportunity of placing his case before the House. It was. only on the last day of meeting that the Minister thanked honourable members for the assistance they had given h i m in the discharge of public business, and, if I understood him aright, he even acknowledged gratef u l l y the assistance and support which he had received in <a general way from honourable, members on this side of the chamber. afraid, with very bad grace from him, when a measure of this character is under consideration, to refuse to allow the B ill to take such a place on the notice-paper as would enable those who have given notice of their intention to move amendments to do so. This amending B ill is rather curious, because its object is to make the Judiciary Act conform to the circumstances which have arisen in consequence of some of the Judges being on leave. It is rather strange that a great instrument like the Judiciary Act should have to be amended to meet the convenience of Judges on leave even before the Judges went on leave. I mentioned the case of Mr Justice Starke's appointment. the amended Act which we are now amending was passed. As the Act then stood we could not have a decision upon questions affecting the Constitution unless a majority of all' the Justices concurred in the decision, and it is now proposed to insert the words "" unless at least three Judges concur i u the decision."" It is right, of course, that the Constitution should not be lightly dealt with, even by a tribunal of the standing of the H i g h Court of Australia. It was as the result of very useful experience that the Act was passed which made it necessary for a majority of all the Justices to concur in a decision affecting the Constitution. I am satisfied that such decisions may be It is given by a majority where there are at least three Judges concurring in a decision. I take this opportunity of saying-it is really the only important matter in connection with the Bill-that I look forward to the time when the H i g h Court of Australia w ill be the final Court of Appeal in the Commonwealth. It is the final Court already in a limited number of cases affecting the rights and' constitutional position of the States inter se. I see no reason at all why the expenses, difficulties, and delays in litigation should not be limited', and why litigants, having disagreed with the finding of the umpire, should be allowed to go outsideAustralia to any other tribunal in the hope It therefore comes, I am of getting a reversal of a decision given against them in this country. I do not wish to extol the virtue or wisdom of our Australian Judges, or to underestimate the standing of the Judiciary of the Privy Council; but I do not think it is open to doubto that the standing, from a legal point of view, of the men we have placed upon the H i g h Court Bench is very high indeed. We have been able toraise lawyers of great eminence, and their judgments, though they have sometimes been reversed by the Privy Council, are not necessarily for that reason unsound. As an Australian Commonwealth we should take a very early opportunity of asserting the principle that the Australian Judiciary should be the final arbiter in respect of not only a particular kind of constitutional question, but every question with which the H i g h Court has jurisdiction to deal. My leader ( Mr Tudor), in addressing himself to the question, rather destroyed one argument advanced by himself when lie said that he did not pretend to know very much about the B ill or the amend-",35,Judiciary Bill Second Readixg

Mr ""WEST -He meant that he lacked legal knowledge. meant; but I think he was much too modest in his estimate of his own attainments. The amendment of which notice has been given by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) is a very hopeful one. There is a very great deal which he seeks to secure by it , and I think it should be carried; but since the carrying of it involves the withdrawal of the B ill , I do not suppose the Government propose to agree to it . The amendment was foreshadowed by the honourable member in a speech which he delivered in this chamber not very long ago. He then pointed out that there was a good deal of misunderstanding as to what are the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth Parliament, especially in regard to the vexed and very important problem of profiteering. I think he succeeded in convincing honourable members on both sides that there does reside in this Parliament very great, if not ample, power to deal with that crying evil. AlthoughI am not one of those who say that the cost of living can be immediately cured by legislation, or that the arbitrary fixation of prices w ill make this land.flow with milk and honey available to all, I do assert with some confidence that the cost of living is a prime question for in vestigation and report. I also say, w it h some confidence, that the Constitution provides abundant powers of investigation and report, and that this Parliament and the country should have the benefit of the exercise of those powers. The Leader of -the Opposition has already referred to the -particular constitutional headings which -give us these powers. Our power of taxation, for instance, is unlimited, in so f a r as 'it does not discriminate between States or parts 'of States, and we have unlimited powers also in regard to census and-statis-fics. There-are many other constitutional vpowers under .which undoubtedly ^we a night give effect to the purpose of 'this amendment, which proposes that all the words after the w o r d "" T h a t "" 'be left'out, ; with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following:in consequence of ""the exploitation of the people <of Australia by profiteering and of the urgent neessity of dealing therewith, the Bill be .now withdrawn for the purpose of introducing at the earliest possible moment more comprehensive measures which will confer all neeessary jurisdiction and powers of investigation on the High Court of Australia and other existing Courts for the enforcement thereof, I know what he and which for the purposes of exercising the powers contained in the Constitution will provide inter alia for(a) requiring statistics of the cost of production of all goods manufactured in Australia and of the landed cost of all goods imported into Australia. An attempt has often been made, especially by honourable members on this side of the House, to secure investigation of the important matters referred to in paragraph a of the amendment. I cannot conceive of a tribunal better suited for such an inquiry-mor e to be relied . upon to make that inquiry in good f a it h and with due regard for the interests of all concerned, including the manufacturers and producers as well as the consumers-tha n the H i g h Court of Australia. Then, again, in paragraph b of the amendment it is proposed that the H i g h Court shall be vested with power to require statistics of the profits accruing to trading corporations or derived from Inter-State shipping, and of the rate of profit on the capital actually employed therein respectively. Our power over corporations is limited under the Constitution, and, unfortunately, has been found in practice to be very much circumscribed. But, at all -events, the H i g h Court should be eminently suited for discriminating between those matters over which the Parliament has and has not jurisdiction, and for limit ing and directing its inquiries into useful and productive channels. It should, of course, have the power to impose penalties and fines for refusing to furnish such Statistics-mor e than once in this country we have had experience of refusals of thatcharacter-^and for all the purposes incidental to that class of requirement.

I could have wished that the consideration of this B ill might have been postponed u n t il the next day of sitting. If that course had been followed, it is possible that I would not have found it necessary to make the remarks which I propose now to address to the House. I should have listened to what the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) had to say in support of the amendment of which he has given notice, and very likely I could have added little to what he had to say. condition munity which may be regarded as I merely mention this distinctly dangerous. No 'one knows better than does the Ministeri n charge of this B ill ( Mr Groom) that sudden changes lead to the destruction of property and credit, and consequent distress in the community. U n fortunately, in looking through the experience of otlier countries, we find that the distress has often culminated in bloodshed. The community should know who amongst us have made the money, and how much they have made. On page 1078 of Hansardf o r 15th August, 1917, honourable members w ill find reprinted a table from, perhaps, the most important report that has been issued since the outbreak of war in any country in the I do not expect world. I refer ' to a report obtained by Sir Alexander Peacock, whose loyalty to K in g and country no one can Elliot question, and which included 265 in stances taken from the income tax returns showing the profits made by those taxpayers, whose identity is hidden by a Y o u , sir, have been numeral, for the years 1914-15-16. I am sorry that the rich persons of the community prevented the extension of that most valuable report, and that the present Government, when asked to follow the noble example set by Sir Alexander Peacock by preparing similar informaHaving made tion for this Parliament, refused to do so. No. 105 in that list did not make any profit in 1914, but in 1915 made £8,690, an increase of 800,000 per cent., assuming a profit of £ 1 in 1914, for in any mathematical calculation some starting point is essential. In 1916, the same taxpayer made a profit of £19,030, or an inerease at the rate of 1,903,000 per cent, on the pre-war profit. . Those figures were exceeded by the returns from taxpayer 262, who likewise, in 1914, made no profit, but in 1915 made £4,89 6 profit, and in the second year of the war, 1916, £20,966 profit. Calculating again from the basis of a profit of £ 1 in 1914, the ratio of increase over the pre-war year was 2,096,600 per cant. Honourable members can imagine how valuable that report would be to Parliament if it were brought up to date.

Why should people be afraid to allow their fellow citizens to know how good are the laws of Australia and how great the potentialities of this country in which they have -amassed great sums of money ?

No. We have taxed incomes heavily, I admit, but not as heavily as they may bave to be taxed in the near future. But as life and blood volunteered 70 per cent., Australia has the right to take, at all events, 35 per cent, of the wealth, if necessary. We are told by our great Statist( Mr Knibbs) that before the war the wealth of Australia was £1,200;000,000. lives have to pay taxation the same as those who did not. which I ;am coming, and if my remarks do not convey what the honourable gentleman means, I ask him, in justice to me, and in ""honour to his iconscience, to record in Hansard what he thinks should be done. Anyhow, I will rspea-k from memory. The estimated value of Australia before the war was £1,200^000,000. It had increased to £1,643,463,376 in 1915. That is a difference of The income, salary, or £400,000,000. Would one be accused of being an anarchist if he claimed, on behalf of Australia, and, what is dearer to us, the children who are to follow us, £400,000,000 out of that £1,600,000,000 for the Commonwealth? That would There is not a member not represent 70 per cent, of the whole, although 70 per cent, of the manhood of Australia offered its life and blood for service in the war; or even 43 per cent., which was the percentage of those accepted for service; or even 33 per cent., which was the percentage of those who were sent away. It would be only 25 per cent.; yet that amount of £400,000,000 would wipe out the whole of the cursed war debt, the interest on which, unless we take some strong action, will be placed upon the shoulders of our children and our children's children, thus carrying on to infinity the curse of the war, and of the Kaiser who caused it. No one appTeciates more than myself the fact 'that if a demand for £400,000,000 were made upon the wealth of Australia credit would tend to be destroyed, the value of property would decline, and the effect would be felt by every house and pastoral run and farm in Australia. I therefore do not advocate that, but there are those who can well spare large sums without being party asked that the whole of the war profits should be taken by the Commonwealth. I again register my protest against what was done with regard to war profits, and warn the Government that if those profits are not taken now Ave may claim them in the future from those who made them unjustly. Every man in the devastated countries of Europe, such as Germany, Austria, 'Servia, Bulgaria, Belgium, or northern France would thank his Creatori f he could go back to his factory, shop, mine, or farm without one penny recompense so long as it was in its pre-war condition.

Here let me say that the only cure for profiteering is gaol. his penal code, which providedI speak from memory-""When any men or any body of men come together for the purpose of raising prices the penalty shall be 20,000 francs ancl six months' imprisonment, but Avhen such increased prices pertain to food such as wine, flour, and bread, They are the punishment shall be doubled,, namely, 40,000 francs and twelve months' i m One prisonment."" It Avill be noted that the penalty is not. a fine with the alternative of imprisonment, but both fine and i m prisonment. That great man, Avith his wonderful organizing capacity, eA'idenitly foresaw the age of Trusts and Combines in Avhich Ave unfortunately live. Here is a quotation f r om the Melbourne Argus of 9th February last:The report of the Committee appointed under the Profiteering Act to inquire into wool-spinners' pro/its has been issued by the Board of Trade. It shows that enormous profits have beeu made by spinners. In the highest instances, the excess percentage over the profits officially allowed works out at 3,900 per cent., and in no case is the excess of profit over that allowed by the War Office schedule of fair pricesless than 250per cent. The Committee says that at least half of the forty types of yam investigated showed a profit of not less than 25d. a pound. The excess percentage Erom my reading of. accruing to the spinners on some grades of yarn ranged from 2,500 per cent, down to 833 per cent.. The spinners objected to the figures on Avhich these calculations were based on the ground that they were misleading, and supplied their ownfigures,which showed profits ranging from 2,400 to250 per cent. Eor instance,, the If all their profits over 50 per cent, had been appropriated by the. nation which permitted them to. exist, and. carry on their industry, they would not hase been so anxious to make large profits. If the heads of those concerns which made excessive profits-for instance, the managing director of Coats'-ha d been put into gaol for a year or two,, and kept there u n t il they disgorged, it would have been a good lesson to them for the benefit of humanity all over the world. There is no sempstress who threads a needle, no woman who patches her children's clothes, that is not .cursed by the greed of that infamous company. thing if the State could take over the whole concern. that with all such concerns.

I only hope the smallest wool-grower had his share. vernment never handed the money to the wool-growers. turbed, therefore, lest honourable members should not agree to that amendment. I know of nothing that will redound more to the credit of Sir Alexander Peacock than will the report which he obtained .some time ago, and which shows the net profits made by companies in Australia during the years 1914, 1915, and 1916. That report is published on page 1079 of Hansard, of 15th August, 1917. I come now to the statements of MrI t is the association of individuals which Knibbs, the Commonwealth Statistician, who has clearly shown us that the cost of living has increased in a much greater ratio than wages. has always to follow the price-fixer. I hold that the Government should fix the prices of all our staple commodities. Take wheat as an example. The farmer should be paid a fair price for his wheat, irrespective of whether the season be a good one or a bad one. The price which the miller charges for gristing should be fixed; and, if he refuses to supply flour to any baker, for the first offence he should be imprisoned for one year. Hon-' orable members may think that I am rather harsh in desiring to see him gaoled. But I am like Draco, the lawgiver of Sparta, who ordered the death penalty to be exacted even for trifling offences, and who, when asked the reason for his action, replied, "" Most crimes deserve death, and as I do not know of a greater punishment than death, I have ordered its infliction for all crimes, small and great alike.'' For years past I have resented the imposition of a penalty which provided an alternative as between a fine and imprisonment. I have done so because the man who is possessed of money is thus enabled to purchase his freedom, whilst the individual who has no money is obliged to go to gaol. Justice would ibe done if both were imprisoned and afterwards required to pay a fine. In the case of a man with no means, the fine could be paid by instalments after his period of imprisonment had expired. In speaking of profiteering in this, chamber, on 3rd March last, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) saidThe firm of J. and P. Coats made a profit of £3,899,000-:that is practically £4,000,000an increase of 50 per cent, over its .profit for the pre-war year 1913-14, which was £2,600,000. There are only two ways in which a manufacturing firm can make big profitshy taking them out of its workpeople, or hy raising .prices to the consumers of the article which it luiumfactures. The honourable member for Yarra, it will be seen,* put the position very concisely. Tbe greatest organizing genius that the world has ever seen, if placed upon an island alone, would not be able to obtain more than food, clothing, and shelter. enables men to amass wealth in large sums. The wage-earner I have no doubt that the thoughts expressed by that great man, Dr. Alfred Bussel Wallace, will yet sway mankind. In his advocacy of land nationalization he stood alone, and was the equal of the great Darwin, who discovered the law of evolution. When Dr. Wallace was over ninety years of age, in an effort to remove from Britain the curse of poverty, he declared, in one of his books, which is to be found in our Parliamentary Library, "" The State must be the heir of all property."" The working out of the details of this problem he left to this and other Houses of Parliament. No man who ever, attempts to commune with his Maker can fail to acknowledge that poverty is a disgrace to our present civilization. In any great city which I visit I make it a practice to inspect the slums, ancl to attend the Police Courts and the auction-room sales. I have had the pleasure of sitting upon the Bench in Glasgow, and of sitting below the Bench in Belfast.

Following the debacle caused iby the land boom in Victoria, we did not allow any auctioneer to sell housebe obliged to close down, I wrote a letter hold furniture in Carlton and Fitzroy, and police assisted us in our endeavours in this direction. If an auctioneer attempted to sell any article of furniture, somebody in the audience would probably ask if it belonged to a woman who was present, and upon receiving an affirmative reply it would suddenly disappear. We stopped that for months and months, and, although it was not according to the law, we felt no twinges of conscience. I can understand the difficulties of the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook), whose billet I would not care to have for double the salary attaching to it , but I think I can show him an easy way out of them. If a table were issued showing in one column the incomes of our wealthy men, indicating them by numbers, and in another column the amounts contributed by them to our various loans, honourable members would receive a shock. I suppose every honourable member knows at least one wealthy man who has not contributed a penny to our loans. I know one who has not done so, and who was one of the loudest-voiced on our recruiting platforms in urging young men to -give their lives. pulsory loans. knows that in the future he may be obliged to .exercise compulsion; but I am seeking to show him a way in which he may avoid doing so. All my efforts have been directed towards the prevention of the destruction of credit. associated with unemployed for thirty years, and the knowledge I have gained in that period has shown me clearly that nothing destroys the credit of the community more quickly than does the presence of a large body of unemployed in its midst. On one occasion I had the honour of assisting to prevent a run on the Colonial Bank in Melbourne, when a number of persons who had a little money endeavoured to make use of the unemployed by handing them bank-notes which they were to wave in front of the bank, with the cry, "" We want our money."" Early in August, 1914, just after the declaration of war, when it was feared that the Broken Hill'mines would to the press, pointing out that if the Commonwealth Government would pur-, chase the whole of the output of metals from the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company at the British selling price, the company might keep their mine in f u l l swiiig, or else, under the law of eminent domain, the State of New South Wales might seize the mine and work it at the risk of the shareholders. During the election campaign which followed shortly afterwards I advocated the same policy on the public platform, and when Parliament met I brought it forward in this House. Subsequently Mr Baillieu managing director of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Limited, asked me for an interview, and I had several conversations with him. He did me the honour of sending me with a message to Mr Fisher, who was then Prime Minister, to the effect that if the Commonwealth Government would buy the metals which were mined by the BrokenH ill companies, the mines would be kept going at full swing, and would also be willing to accept 30 per cent, less than the selling price of silver in London. Prior to the war silver was selling in London at 2s. per oz. Each ounce of silver would make 5s. 6d. in currency, less 3 per cent, in England for smelting costs, and perhaps 3 i or 4 per cent, in Australia. But, so far as Australia was concerned, seeing that the companies were prepared to accept 30 per cent, less than the London selling price, the cost of silver to the Commonwealth Government would have been Is. 4fd. per oz. Every £1,000,000 of Australian notes used to purchase silver, when I have been minted, would have produced £3,928,000 in silver currency, less cost of minting. However, Mr Eisher, acting on the advice of the officials of the Treasury, whose minds, no doubt, run somewhat in a narrow groove, declined the offer. I had used an argument somewhat on the following lines:"" Our Army failed in the South African war, and it may be, though God forbid it. that our Navy may fail in our hour of direst need.

I have gone into figures with an accountant, and ascertained that Australia would have been richer by £20,000,000 if my suggestion had been adopted.. If it had been applied to the BrokenH ill Proprietary Limited all the metal producers of Australia would ultimately have come under the same rule. I thank honorahle members for giving me their attention. I have only to add that when we are in Committee I propose to"" move that the following new clause be added to the B ill : Notwithstanding anything contained in this or any other Act., it shall be mandatory upon any Judge, magistrate, or Commissioner, when any case is before the Court, upon the request of on Australian citizen who is under examination or cross-examination, that al] future quesprofiteering. tions shall be asked personally by such Judge, magistrate, or Commissioner to forthwith ask such questions, and in such way as such Judge, magistrate,, or Commissioner shall consider right and just, the examining barrister, solicileave to continue my remarks at a later tor, &u., having thc right to state his question to the Court, after which the presiding Judge, magistrate, or Commissioner, if he approves the question, shall ask the witness in the way he deems best. It has long been my object to protect f r om confusion and insult unfortunate witnesses subjected to the bullying tactics of certain members of the Bar. Whereas a Judge or a magistrate may make allowance for answers given under stress from the box, the witness, is not at the same time freed from mental disturbance-. Often a Judge has checked brow-beating tactics, and it iswell"" recognised that no Judge would examine awitness in. thc bullying and insulting manner employed by certain individuals who have earned a Court notoriety. I recall that one Judge, in a Nflw South Wales circuit, asked a witness to step down from the box. He put the examining lawyer there in his stead, and asked, "" Are you. prepared to produce sworn evidence concerning the statements upon which you are basing your questions?"" The answer was "" No . "" The. Judge proceeded, "" Then, hy what right do you ask these questions of the witness?"" He ordered the lawyer to stand Mr Fisher allowed the down and to learn to be more manly, if ThonI connot more gentlemanly, in his future behaviour in that Court. I know of another Judge who makes a practice of intervening in. examination along lines which he considers unfai r or bullying. That is well,' of course, but it does not save the unfortunate witness from a l l mental confusion and distress.
