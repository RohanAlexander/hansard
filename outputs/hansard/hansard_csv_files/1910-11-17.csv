Thursday, A.m., And","read prayers. representing the Minister of Defence, upon noticeWhether, in view of tbe fact that the arrangements made with the Victorian State authorities for the berthing and refitting of the new Commonwealth torpedo boat destroyers at Williamstown are of a purely temporary character, and that the accommodation is not completely satisfactory, as disclosed by the published correspondence on the matter, the Minister will still consider the advantages to be gained by udopting the recommendation of the Naval Director and arrange to send thc boats on to Brisbane, ""where there exists the only Commonwealth naval depflt and equipment necessary for their service and all the refitting they need after the long voyage from England""? Williamstown are temporary, so far as berthing the destroyers are concerned, but the arrangement made is completely satisfactory to the Department as it enables it to use its own shops, machinery, and men. There is, therefore, no necessity for any further action in this case. The question of the best position of proposed Commonwealth Naval bases, dockyards, & c , has been referred to Admiral Sir Reginald Henderson, KC.B., for report, and when such report is received the Government will decide what action is to be taken in regard to the question. General, upon notice1. What has been the usual practice of his Department in regard to payment of overtime in the senior branches of the clerical division in New South Wales? z. Has there been any recent departure from former practice in this regard? 3. Have 'any complaints been received by the Department from senior omcers in regard to non-payment for overtime? 4. Have any exceptions been made, and, if so, why? bave been furnished by the Public Service Commissioner:10.30 1. It is not the practice to recognise claims for overtime by heads of branches and by corresponding responsible officers. Such payments were allowed in connection with overtime claims for 1906-8, the first submitted since Federation, but the principle was subsequently denned that controlling officers should not be pecuniarily interested in the working of overtime. 2. No claims from such omcers have been re-cognised since approval for 1906-8. 3. Yes, from three officers. 4. No, not since the adoption of the principle referred to in reply to 1. ral, upon noticeIf he will lay upon the table of the House' the report upon Postal Administration of Mr Da Costa, dated 28th February, 1910, and all papers associated therewith? to show the honourable member the papers referred to if be desires to see them. master-General, upon notice1.

I have on several occasions introduced deputations to the Minister asking for greater protection in regard to, among other things, the banana industry, but nothing has been done to help those whose views were put forward. The growing of bananas may seem to some honourable members an unimportant industry, but it is really of considerable importance, because it is one of the few that can be -carried on profitably in the north, and will, 'therefore, assist to settle territory which, in the interests of defence alone, should be settled. Large cargoes of this frurt are so frequently brought to our ports from -other places-grow n too, by coloured labour -that honourable members should be -easily convinced of the need for a high duty on bananas. All we ask is that the -duty on this fruit should be made the same as on other green fruit, namely, 2s. per -central. The Minister has on several occasions given a sympathetic reply to requests for the removal of what is, after all, an -anomaly, and only a fortnight ago half -promised to redress our grievance. duties would involve the revision of the Tariff. -expecting its revision for the removal of such anomalies. -take twelve months. proposals, if they had been placed before ""the Committee, would have been agreed to at once. I desire also to point out that canned pineapples are being introduced from Singapore and Hong Kong at prices .against which local canners cannot compete. We ask that the duty on this product be increased. There is at present a duty of 25s. per central, or 3d. per lb., on dried fruit, and we think that the duty on canned pineapples should be made at least as high. T feel, however, that, under the circumstances, any appeal to the Minister will fall upon deaf ears, and I can but express my ^grievous disappointment at his action. think that the proposals of the Minister of Trade and Customs, which merely relate to definitions and the removal of administrative defects in the Tariff will be received by Australia with a good deal of disappointment. When I was conducting my election campaign throughout the Protectionist centres of my constituency, I was constantly assailed with the statement that the Labour party were the true friends of Protection. Protectionist again? Minister of External Affairs will hardly be able to challenge my Protectionist votes during the consideration of the last Tariff. honourable member reconcile his attitude now with his action in joining the Fusion, in which there were forty-two members who, at one time, at all events, were Free Traders? the Fusionist party had in the forefront of its platform a straight-out Protectionist plank. We said, and said properly, and reasonably, that inasmuch as the House had decided on the last occasionto deal with the Tariff with incomplete information, it was necessary that we should create a Board of Trade for the purpose of making a full investigation into the operations of trade throughout Australia, in order that the House might have full and accurate information on the working of the Tariff, the operations of commerce throughout the Commonwealth, and also the relations of the Commonwealth with other countries would with respect to trade and commerce. That proposal stood in the forefront of. the platform of the last Government at the election, and I venture to say that had it been returned to power, one of the first measures of this session would have been a measure for the appointment of a Board of Trade. The full term of this session would have been available to the Board for the purpose of making necessary investigations, and at the close of the session its report would have been placed before the House, and something like a systematic consideration of the Tariff for the removal of anomalies with the maintenance of the Protectionist policy of the country. happened ?",15,Customs Tariff

33,Mr Batchelor,"When would that haveevery' Protectionist centre of my constituency with the statement that Labour Codlin was the true Protectionist's friend, and not Fusionist Short. I showed then that the Labour party, who were endeavouring to kow-tow to the Protectionist party to secure the Protectionists' votes outside their ranks, had not sufficient courage to place in their platform a truly Protectionist plank. The schedule which has been placed on the table in the closing hours of the session is conclusive evidence that there was no sincerity about that Protectionist boast on the part of the Labour party at the last election. With what do we find ourselves faced in the closing hours of the session ? A mere piece of formality and make-believe has been laid before the House instead of a proposal for the true removal of anomalies. Notwithstanding the fact that very many important and influential deputations have waited upon the Minister of Trade and Customs during the session, we learn from his statement that there will be no revision of the Tariff, or no real removal of anomalies until after a referendum has been taken in March or April next. What does that mean? It means that in all probability tlie real removal of anomalies will be delayed until next session. It may be taken for granted that before any attempt is made to reach anything like the position which was promised by the last Government, a period of eighteen months must elapse. a fine political cry for the next election. about that. vernment be truly Protectionist, why should it resort to what appears to me to be a subterfuge, and that is to take the risk of the proposed amendment of the Constitution failing, instead of carrying out their duties on the basis of the Constitution as it is ? If it be a truly Protectionist party, being fulfilled. working on the basis of the present Constitution, its bounden duty is to bring before the House some vindication of the policy which it so loudly professed at the last election. I think that when the terms of this schedule become known generally many thousands of persons who cast their votes for the present Ministry on the strength of their Protectionist professions -will regret their action. If the statement of the Minister means anything, it means that if the referendum to be taken in March or April next should fail, and no amendment of ' the Constitution take place, the Government party will cease to be a Protectionist party, or cease even to profess to be one. A few days ago figures were published showing that notwithstanding the fact that the Tariff was revised in 1906-7, we still have an enormous increase in imports. exports. ing to the last figures available, we have an increase of over ,£2,000,000 in exports. The imports in 1909 exceeded those in 1906 by over £7,000,000, thefiguresbeing £51,171,000 and ,£44,744,000 respectively. That, it seems to me, has falsified all the predictions that were made whilst the last Tariff was under consideration. in the imports of articles which are largely used and which carry substantial Protectionist duties is just as great as it is in the case of articles which are on the free list. I am willing to admit that we have had an unprecedented period of prosperity, whicli, of course, would partly account for a very large proportion of the increased importation. The increase, however, has been so substantial that it shows that, after all, some action should be taken-somethin g more than the mere pretence of a removal of anomalies such as we have before the Committee. The real Protectionist party of Australia must be profoundly disappointed with this attempt on the part of the Minister to remove anomalies. It may cause them perhaps to regret that, unwittingly, they cast their votes for the Ministerial party on the strength of their Protectionist professions, which neither at present nor in the near future' seem to have very much chance of [10.54] -Perhaps if I were to say at the outset that I was not somewhat disappointed with the Minister's interpretation of anomalies I should not be giving expression to my feelings.

Suppose,, for instance, that there is a duty of 50 per cent, on the manufactured article, and a duty of 40, per cent, on the raw material necessary for its manufacture, and that the raw material is not produced in the country that gives a protection of only 10 per cent, to the manufactured article, and consequently that is, in my opinion, an anomaly. I should think that that would appeal to the Protectionists here as a reasonable interpretation. article which has been referred to by manydeputations to the Minister, and that is. women's made-up material. have, if my interpretation be correctj one of the most glaring anomalies in the -Tariff.

Such words are no more binding than is the honourable member's statement. want to say that they are. Government was that there was to be no interference with the Tariff. nuendoes in which some honourable members are indulging are the result of hearsay, and at the worse it can only be said that my statement is based upon hearsay evidence. We cannot, however, shut our eyes to the fact that the Fusion party that was before the people on the hustings, consisted of forty-two members who at one time in their lives, at all events, were declared Free Traders. referring to the honourable member, who in this regard might be described as a Triton among the minnows. If we are ever to have an adequate system of Protection from the House as at present constituted, it can come from only one side, and that the Government side, of the Chamber. I believe that it will come. If the proposed amendments of the Constitution are accepted by the people, I , as a Protectionist, will not be satisfied, nor do I think the great majority of honourable members on this side of the House will be, until we have in Australia something more than a cobweb system of Protection. I unhesitatingly declare that the present Tariff is merely a cobweb system of Protection. It does not protect at all. But I hope to see adopted a Protective Tariff which will make us second to no other of the declared Protectionist countries of the world. I do not think Australia signed a petition to the Ministhat that is too much for a Protectionist to expect. policy for a young country like Australia, and that is a solid and sufficient system of Protection which will enable us to build up our industries-industrie s in which our own men can be employed at white men's wages -and to realize the further plank of our platform, ""equal pay for equal work."" Under such a system where women are employed instead of men they will receive the same wages that men are paid, and instead of women taking the place of males in various industries the men, perhaps, will be able under such a system to make them their wives and support them in comfort. I could not rest satisfied without making this statement. WhatI have said has been due to a feeling of disappointment that a wider interpretation has not been given to the word "" anomalies."" I recognise, however, that the Minister of Trade and Customs has been perfectly consistent. He assured, not only deputations, but .this House, that until there was some reasonable guarantee that the workers and consumers of Australia would share in the benefits of the sj-stem of Protection, he would not favour a reopening of the Tariff. Such an attitude can well be understood. I , as a Protectionist, however, had hoped that he would go further than he has done, and I trust that the day is not far distant when we shall have that degree of Protection that will satisfy the aspirations of those who claim to be Protectionists. I confess to a feeling of disappointment when, in looking through the schedule, T find that the Minister of Trade and Customs has not taken into consideration a number of letters and petitions which he has received from residents of South Australia in regard to the great wattle-bark industry. It has been pointed out to him that that industry provides a great deal of employment for our people, and that it is being subjected to the unfair competition of wattle bark brought in free from. South Africa, where, I understand, it is produced by black labour, under very different conditions from those which obtain in Australia. In South Africa it is grown, ground up, and shipped by black labour, and it is brought to Australia as ballast. It is almost impossible for our people to grow wattle bark in the face of such competition. Something like 200 wattlegrowers in the southern district of South ter, pointing out these difficulties,, and also There is only one conceivable drawing his attention to the danger of the",19,Customs Tariff

88,Mr Livingston (Barker) [11.10],"introduction, in this way, of stock diseases from South Africa. As honourable members are well aware, stock infected with skin and other diseases are prone to rub themselves against wattle and other roughbarked trees, and there is thus a danger of stock diseases being introduced to Australia by means of the wattle bark that we import from South Africa. That one phase of the question alone should induce the Government at once to take action to stop this importation of bark, or, if they cannot do so, to provide for its proper inspection and fumigation. I am confident that if the Government do not give some protection to the wattle-growers of South Australia there will be a great falling off in character of those with which we are now production, and that must be detrimental to the people. The industry provides work at a time of the year when .employment is very scarce in country districts, and I hope that the Minister will do something to help it. Since the framing of the last Tariff, flint stones, such as are used in the mines, have been discovered on the south-east coast of South Australia. Thousands of these stones can be obtained there, and can be delivered to the mines all over Australia at a very cheap rate. Since .this discovery, however, the flint stones imported from Iceland and France have been reduced in price to the extent of several pounds per ton. There is no protective duty, and the result is that owing to this reduction in prices those engaged in the local industry have on their hands a great heap of stones, which have been picked over at great cost, and carted to the' nearest railway station for delivery. There are hundreds of tons of these stones which they cannot deliver to the mines owing to the low prices ruling. Both these industries are peculiar to our own country, and for the protection of our own people I trust that the Minister of Trade and Customs will devise some means before the session closes of assisting them. I have placed before him all the facts, and he has been good enough to say that he will do all that he can to assist these industries. I am sure that he will carry out his promise to carefully look into the matter, and afford these industries a little Protection in the interest of the workers of Australia. [11.16] I am too recently from a sick bed to take a prominent part in a debate of this character. But some expressions which have fallen from the lips of previous speakers impel me to say a few words, in justice to myself. In the course of his remarks, the honourable member for Wimmera declared-and I think his statement is supported by the Leader of the Opposition-that the late Fusion was based upon a recognition of the principles of Protection, and that its purpose was to make the existing Protective Tariff even more protective in its incidence. AllI know is that in New South Wales the case for the Fusion was scarcely presented in that light. There, it was intimated that the Fusion was based upon an agreement to remedy fiscal anomalies, and it was ieprasented that those anomalies were of the asked to deal. It was not alleged that any necessity existed for the drastic changes which the honourable member for Wimmera desires to see embodied in this Bill. move Tariff anomalies, and our course of T action in that connection was to be based upon accurate information supplied to us by a Board of Trade. what refreshing to hear the honourable member's statement of the basic principles of the Fusion. Possibly the honourable member for Parramatta will add his version to it. tion by remaining silent, and smiling. that he who laughs last laughs best. I need scarcely remind honourable members that in this ChamberI have always been an exponent of Free Trade principles. have been the working bullock of the Protectionist-Free Trade combination which now sits upon the other side of the chamber. But from this time onward it cannot count upon me as its working bullock. I am prepared to assist Protectionists, who believe as honestly in their fiscal principles as I do in mine, to extend the present measure of Protection, not merely to the manufacturers, but also to the workers who are engaged in protected industries. I do not abandon one iota of the principles which I hold. But until the referendum has been taken, and this Parliament has been empowered to extend a measure of protection to the workers and the consumers, I intend to strongly oppose the granting of increased protection to",20,Customs Tariff

A good many honourable members who are dissatisfied with the proposals contained in this Bill desire not merely a rectification of fiscal anomalies, but a re-casting of the entire Tariff. It is all very well for the honourable member for Indi to declare that in the matter of hickory spokes importers enjoy an advantage over local manufacturers, and for the honourable member for Herbert to assert that an unsatisfactory position exists in regard to pineapples and bananas. with such anomalies, we should require to undertake a complete revision of the Tariff, in order to do justice all round. The Minister is acting wisely by adhering to his promise not to deal with Tariff reform this session, but merely to remove anomalies-chiefl y in. matters of interpretation-whicli have been disclosed as the result of administration. My experience in the Parliament of New South Wales, and in this Parliament, has taught me that Tariff revision is a work which occupies practically the whole life of the Parliament. At any rate, there is very little opportunity to deal with anything else. I trust that the-party to which I belong will not consider for a moment any -proposal in the nature of a re-opening of the Tariff until the referendum has been taken, and its results are known. When that has been done, if the Government are armed with power to extend a fair measure of protection to the workers in protected industries, and to prevent the consumers being exploited by monopolies, they may then be under an obligation to re-open it. I agree with one or two observations which have been made by honourable members opposite to the effect.that no revision of the Tariff should take place until a Commission or a Board of Trade has investigated alleged anomalies, and claims for increased protection. I do not think that that is a work which should be undertaken by an InterState Commission. taught me that those persons who are particularly interested in securing increased taxation for protective purposes, and who to achieve their object are prepared to bombard honourable members with circulars, or to worry them with personal interviews, frequently hesitate to affirm upon oath the statements which they make when they are not under examination. I recognise that the information which was obtained by the Tariff Commission proved of great value when we were dealing with the last Tariff. Before any further Tariff revision is undertaken, I think that an inquiry of the character I have suggested should be instituted into its working. I hope the Government will consider the advisableness of appointing a Commission of this character, or, what would be. better still, a Board of Trade, which is urgently needed, not only in connection with the Tariff, but in matters quite apart. There are Protectionist members who, when they are called upon to deal with industries outside their Buti f we attempted to deal own little communities, develop into very good Free Traders. This was evident in previous Tariff debates, when purely New South Wales interests were under consideration. A great injustice has been done to a firm in Sydney under the administration of the Tariff. A company started to make cardboard boxes, importing the raw material, which was on the free list, or subject to very low duties. When that company began to extend its operations and employ a large number of people, certain manufacturing interests in Victoria discovered that cardboard could be made here, provided it were made dutiable at a higher rate. Company. be, but that does not make them any the less good citizens, who were engaged in developing a useful and important industry. Nothing was said or done until the output of the firm began to grow, and their imports of the raw material became fairly extensive. In consequence of representations made in Victoria, the Customs' Department decided to charge a high rate of protective duty on cardboard, with the result that it proved more profitable to import the boxes than to make them here. My experience has Firth and Company decided to test the validity of the decision of.the Department, and instituted legal proceedings. The Department, however, instead of facing the Court, withdrew; and the fair assumption was that, discovering themselves to be in a false position, the Customs authorities had decided to revert to the old conditions. On this the company gave a considerable order for cardboard outside the Commonwealth ; but the Department framed new regulations, again placing cardboard on the higher list. This",21,Customs Tariff

To ihat extent the honourable gentleman makes a departure from his declared intention to merely rectify anomalies.

He has delivered, as far as he may this morning, a Free Trade speech^ and, in the course of it, has cited an instance which exemplifies what should have been done by the Government. The action taken by the Minister in regard to cardboards is just what I had expected him to propose in regard to other anomalies; but the other proposals cannot be regarded in any way called rectification of anomalies is simply Such powers should not be a means to make the working of the Department more easy in regard to many items; but as to any real rectification, I have not dethere is none.

It is not worth my while at the present time to read out all the anomalies that ought to be dealt with, but I have here thirty-three very much like that represented by anomalies from the departmental point of view. I have before me a list of sixtyseven instances which, from a Protectionist point of view, are mostly anomalies. The Minister is dealing with one case, but not with all the others. I will exemplify what I say by quoting an instance. Under TheI working in this country for a long time Why could not that",22,Customs Tariff

Then, as mentioned by the honourable member for Herbert with reference to the fruit-growers, the Italians and Americans are capturing the Australian trade in lemons, apples, and lemon-peel which is imported pickled. As a partiallymanufactured article, lemon-peel is admitted duty free. The fruit-canners are also interested in this trade. Surely these articles are ih the same category as cardboard. I do not think that any honourable member can say that the Protectionists of this -country will be at all satisfied to wait for at least half-a-year or three-quarters of a year, or, it may be, a year, or a year and a half, for these anomalies to be rectified. Let me tell the party at present in power that they are there mainly in consequence of Protectionist support. Wales also they received the great bulk of the Protectionist support. There were .only a few of the Conservative-Protectionists who did not support them. They are in power by the support of the Protectionists, not of one State only, but of every State. I think, therefore, that the Protectionists deserve to be considered. that the question of new Protection ought not to be dealt with in connection with the Tariff. dealing with that matter promptly as the Minister is, because I consider that the labouring classes should have their meed of Protection as well as the manufacturers. I am referring now, however, to a matter that is really outside the question of new Protection. Whom have we to blame for the present situation? We have to blame the Opposition chiefly. Did the Leader of the late Government, now Leader of the Opposition, suppose that he could get Mr expressed by the honourable member for Joe Cook, Mr Bruce Smith, and men such as they, to frame a Tariff that would he acceptable to the people of this country? thing that I think shows the state of the honourable member's feelings in reference to this question.

VVe have heard from a memI am as strongly in favour of ber of the Fusion party this morning what they were prepared to do. They wanted to appoint a Board or Commission. But a Commission was appointed by a former Government, which went into the whole question of the Tariff. Did not the honourable member for Bendigo enter assiduously into the whole question, and deal with it thoroughly? Why should we appoint another Commission? In that regard I dissent altogether from the opinion .Calare. I do not think that we should wait for the report of another Commission. We have had enough of Tariff inquiries. The people now expect us to deal with the question in an equitable manner. We expect the present Government to do something better than their predecessors were prepared to do.

In these few remarks I have tried to comment carefully, upon the position, but I feel strongly that the greatest thing that a new country can have for its own development is a Tariff that will properly protect its inagain to-day that we have in Australia men dustries. Honourable members can talk about this or that being a mythical thing, but when you get down to the bedrock of .the prosperity of a young country, YOU have to depend upon your Protective"" Tariff. We have in Australia the raw material for the manufacture of nearly everything that could be mentioned, and we do not want to have imported manufactures if we can help it. They are good only for the man who makes his 25 to 40 per cent, through bringing them over the border; but the man who manufactures here employs the people of this country. People who talk about bringing population into Australia should be reminded that the place will never be pushed ahead very much simply by putting people on the lands of the country. No nation was ever made populous by that means only. People have to produce and manufacture what is consumed by those in the cities, but it is the cities and the manubut would rather increase them. Every factures that make any large population. Land settlement and the extension of manufactures should go hand in hand, and not be antagonistic to each other. have wished, in the interests of the Ministry, that the same treatment as has been given to cardboard had been extended to the other articles to whicli I have referred, in a way that would not have interfered with the Minister's idea of introducing new Protection after the referendum, while at the same time it would have given the people of this country a feeling of security with the present Ministry in power, and not the feeling of doubt which is in their minds at present. I know that the Minister of Trade and Customs understands and sympathizes with my disappointment at the meagre list of real anomalies placed before us for rectification. While I am sick, sad, and sorry to see this, I feel sure that, in view of the stress of this session, which has been unequalled in any country in the world for the number and importance of the measures passed, the Protectionists of the community will be prepared .to possess their souls in patience. Therefore, in spite of my disappointment and deep regret, I endorse the Hume. He referred specially to the industry of wire nails. There is also another industry in which I have taken a special interest, and brought under the notice of Minister after Minister, producing figures that have not been controverted. I say fit to make clothing good enough for any man to wear; and women fit to produce garments to deck the most beautiful woman in the world. Let me remind honourable members of the large deputation which filled the great hall of this Parliament, and even overflowed into the hall outside, representing 7,000 workers, the vote and influence of every one of whom, to my almost certain knowledge, was given in favour of the Labour party at the last election. I know that those 7,000 Protectionist votes and the influence they represented made our majority in the Senate election in Victoria possible. I asked for them die protection that I asked for the woollen workers. When I addressed them in various factories, not one of them dissented from my statement that by no act or vote of mine would I lessen the duties on woollen goods, one of those worker? was loyal to that statement, and every manufacturer, at various deputations that I introduced, placed it I could plainly and squarely before the Minister. But when we know that goods are not made here, and our Customs officers are prepared to prove that they are not, then let us admit diem absolutely free. There is an important principle at stake in regard to the paper duties. Certain members know how villainously Sands and McDougall treated old women, some of wnom had been twenty years in their employ. I know that the Tariff alteration proposed now will benefit that firm, but as a Protectionist I welcome it, knowing that when we have new Protection we shall not let that firm any longer skulk behind the Legislative Council of Victoria, which would not appoint a Wages Board for the industry. Why? Because that company owned and controlled the three factories here. The Minister knows that is an instance in which we want the new Protection to compel such a company as that to do justice to their employees. Let me get back to the question of the 7,000 workers.",25,Customs Tariff

I think we might divide without debate on a number of items to be considered this session. through until Christmas, and we should have to neglect more important legislation. entirely agree with him, in view of the fact that many of our important inI can agree with the dustries are languishing. I cannot overlook the position of the 7,000 womenworkers in Victoria alone, to whom I have referred, and the number engaged in the same industry throughout the Commonwealth must be 13,000.

138,Mr Deakin (Ballarat) {12/22],"think ought to be briefly referred to, as pertinent to this debate. Honourable members who sat in the late Parliament will recollect the very special circumstances of last session. I have heard allusions today to the stress imposed upon us during the present session, but whatever stress we have experienced up to the present time was more than exceeded by tlie stress of some few weeks during last session. But for the fierce and prolonged party struggle that then obtained, these anomalies, and probably many others, would have been dealt with in that session. I have refreshed my memory by turning to official declarations made in both Houses by representatives of our Government. I frequently went into this Tariff question with my then colleague the last Minister of Trade and Customs, the present honourable member for Kooyong. Owing to the struggle to which I have referred, we lost that year in dealing with anomalies, and we are now losing another year. So far as consistency with the programme of their party is concerned, there is very little for which we can reproach the present Government on this head. I say that frankly, because I was entirely dissatisfied with the attitude adopted by their leader, and their election programme, from the first in regard to Protection, and perpetually commented upon it. part to place that question first, second, or third. On the contrary, it was distinctly relegated to a lower place in their programme, and was only to be dealt with conditionally at a very indefinite time. I thoroughly disagreed with that negative policy when it was announced, and disagree with it now; but I cannot pretend that I have been taken by surprise, nor can honourable members opposite who studied tlieir leader's programme assert that they have been taken by surprise. Protection is one of the questions which was not, and is not, included expressly in the party platform of my honourable friends opposite. It has been left to individual members of the party, like the honourable memher who preceded me, to make it, if not the first, amongst the first of the planks of their individual platforms. That was their individual attitude, but it was not the attitude of the present Government, though I think it ought to have been. They might have done very much better for us than they have done during this session if that judge for Ministers. The anomalies tha* Ur. Deakin. had been their attitude. Members were perfectly well aware that, whatever place they might give the question in their programme, we only missed settling this part of it last year owing to our party struggles in Parliament. We are now missing this year, without any real necessity. I undertake to say that this measure will probably be disposed of finally in two or three hours from now, and the addition of twenty or thirty necessary amendments, which, as no one knows better than the Minister of Trade and Customs, would receive practically a united vote in this House, might very well have been proposed. Some, no doubt, would have desired higher duties than would be proposed by the Minister, and some lower; but I believe that three-fourths of the members of this House would be found behind any reasonable proposal to remove the most obvious of the anomalies. The urgency of the matter now, as I took the liberty of reminding honourable members yesterday, is that we missed last year, are agreeing to miss this year, and are going to miss next year. It is perfectly well known that the two Imperial events that are to take place next year, the crowning of His Majesty and the assembling of the Imperial Conference, will require the attendance of some of the principal members of the Government on the other side of the world, and, return as rapidly as they may, there will not be There was no promise on their time to deal with the question of the Tariff in the next calendar year. Just as the snowball set rolling increases in size as it rolls, so every year we discover fresh fiscal demands for consideration. Necessarily, therefore, when at last we approach the consideration of the Tariff, the schedule we shafl have to face will be a much longer one than it would have been if we had undertaken the work this year, and longer still than it would have been if we had been able to do the work last year. I wish to be scrupulously fair to the Government. They can claim to be judged by the utterances of their leader, and the spokesmen of their party; but I think they might have made the task much easier for many of their supporters if they had proposed to meet the simple practical necessities of the situation at once. They might have done that with advantage to their prestige, without loss of time, and with great gain to this country.

For that, after all, is what we expect from every referendum, whether we are fortunate enough to obtain it or not. This may be good tactics, but it is not fair play to the electors. I do not consider that it does them justice, or that it is liberal die last election. These are the gentleor democratic in any sense. A consideration of all the circumstances tends to show that, owing to the political causes to which I have alluded,, the industries of Australia have suffered very badly for the last two or three years. They have had the cup at their lips snatched away on several occasions, and on this occasion altogether without necessity. As regards those cases in which the Tariff is absolutely imperfect, an obvious injustice is being done. The Ministry have thrown away a splendid chance of remedying real grievances. I have admitted that Protection itself' was not in their programme, but it must be remembered that their policy contained nothing to prevent justice from being done. They have missed a golden opportunity. They would 'have strengthened their position. They would have done work for this country which would have been felt through all its industrial circles, and have been of great advantage to those concerned; it would have enriched Australia, and have soothed a great many heart-burnings. To that wise and just act they certainly would have looked back with great satisfaction to themselves and gain to Australia.

Furthermore, this is a new Government with new ideals concerning industrial, financial, and other matters which must go hand in hand with the Tariff, and they may be excused if they do not attempt to deal with the Tariff piecemeal. They must also be excused if they wish to learn the attitude of the public on new Protection before they re-open the Tariff. If anybody is toblame in that connection, it is manufacturers like Joshua, Beale, and others, who flew to the arms of the Free Traders to down every Protectionist Labour man at men who must shoulder the burden of any accusation which may be brought that the Tariff has not been re-opened at this juncture. My sympathy goes out to the Government. On the attitude of the Conservative-Protectionists in the election fight, they are justified in ganging warily anyhow, and waiting to see whether or not the people are prepared to grant industrial poWers to this Parliament. I , as a Nationalist, am prepared to take the broad view of building up national industries. I am an old, as well as a new Protectionist. At the same time, we have now reached a pass when, as in other countries, particularly America, we see national industries built up and protected by the Tariff, whilst the chief benefits go into the pockets of a few persons. When we see that taking place we have to go over the ground again. I desire to thank the great leader of the Protectionists in this HouseI refer to the honorable member for Hume-for his insistence in urging upon the Minister the desirability of rectifying anomalies, such as he has pointed out in connection with the .manufacture of cardboard boxes. I ask the Minister whether, after this measure is passed, he will not still have the same power as he has had to deal with the cardboard-box business? If so, we can It would pass this schedule, and he will, still have power to redress anomalies such as haveoccurred in that industry. I shall be glad if the Minister will answer that question when he is replying. If the statements of the honourable member for Hume be correct, it is the duty of the Minister to rectify the anomalies in other divisions where hehas power to do so, just as he has been doing in connection with the cardboard-box business. manufacturers of cardboard boxes deliberately altered their method of manufacture in order to get under the free list goods which should be dutiable.

As a straight-out Protectionist, ' I do not desire a re-opening of the Tariff in every Parliament. For the good of our industries, and for the reasonable settlement of trade and commerce, I should like the Tariff to be left secure for a reasonable number of years, but whenever anomalies can be dealt with, I shall be only too pleased to see them brought up for rectification. Strong Protectionist as I am, I would oppose strongly a wholesale re-opening of the Tariff during this session. In the first place, we have not the time in which to do justice to the subject, and I do not see why we should introduce new Protection for two or three industries in the ensuing session I shall make one to urge the necessity for re-opening the Tariff. I am not by any means satisfied with this schedule, especially as we hope to secure new Protection, and with it a guarantee that not only will the manufacturers be protected, but also the workers and the consumers. We should then re-open the Tariff as a whole. We should then have a new Tariff, bearing the imprimatur of the Labour party, and so constructed as to suit its members, and also those who believe in the mixing of Democracy with Tariff reform. I hope that we shall never find on this side men less sincere than the old Protectionists in standing by Australian industries. I am pleased that the honourable member for Calare made the statement which he did. It gave me, as a Protectionist, very great pleasure, because if the Democrats, who in the past have fought the Tariff, are willing to stand behind Australian industries solidly, if we give justice to the workers and to the public, it will be a healthy sign as regards the future success of Australian industries. I have never doubted the sincerity of even the so-called Free Trade members of the Labour party to do the best they could, according to theirlights, for those industries. -No doubt the Minister has heard some grumblings from this quarter as regards the schedule. I was hopeful, as I have said both here and elsewhere, that when the time did come to deal with Tariff"" anomalies,"" a very liberal interpretation would be placed on that word. The schedule includes only about fifty items. Items on the Tariff are so inter-related that the schedule will affect a larger number of items than appears on the surface. Although the schedule was only issued to honourable members yesterday, and published in the press this morning, I have already received intimations that, owing to the alterations which have been made, and which, will lead to smoother working from both the official and the manufacturing stand-points, some of the items which may appear insignificant to honourable members will have very considerable influence on our trade in many connexions. We do not realize exactly what the effects of the amendments are likely to be.

I am very pleased to get that assurance, because no person who scans the schedule can say that any greater measure of Protection is being conceded than is given in the existing Tariff. I join with the honourable member for New England, the honourable member for Indi, and quite a number of Other Protectionists on this side, of both the old and the new type, in hoping, that, before the expiry of 1911, we shall have, if not on the statute-book, near completion, a Tariff modelled on the most up-to-date lines, and conducive to the proper conduct of various industries, favorable to the workers, and very much more favorable to the consumers than the present one. almost one-sided, the new Protection is three-sided. the workers and the public generally have not benefited by the old Protection. I should be untrue to long-held ideas if I made such a statement. I know thousands of workmen who can testify that the old Protection has had very considerable influence in building up immense industries in our midst, from which Australia, as well as the workers, benefits to a very large extent. The new Protection is, I repeat, threeincluded in the new Protection. We emsided. manufacturer at the Customs House, protection for the workers who are engaged in manufacturing, and protection, as far as it can be afforded, to the consumers. That trinity of protection has taken the wind out of the sails of what is known as the old Free Trade party, and to-day we find quite a number of Free Traders, not only on the Labour side, but also on the other side in politics, rallying behind what is generally termed the national policy.

257,Mr Joseph Cook,"The Tariff is now before the Committee. There are about seventy items in the little schedule which he has brought down, and if the Protectionists of this House, who believe that the country is dying for further import duties, let this occasion go by, they will not be able to blame the Minister altogether, but will have to blame themselves. They may talk as much as they like about the Minister having sold the country, but he has furnished them with the opportunity to do what they want, and if they do not take it they also must take the responsibility after the. schedule is passed. On page 2960 of Hansard of last session, Mr Crouch asking a Question, the Minister saidI shall support what I think best. The sooner and ostrich feathers, all of which, I sup we consider these anomalies the better I shall be pleased, and the less some honourable members opposite will be pleased. I hope we shall bave an opportunity of dealing with anomalies before the next election. The honourable member when ""on this side of the House wanted to deal with the anomalies right off. They could not and must not be permitted to wait, as importations were pouring in, and they ought to be dealt with that session. There are in the Tariff many glaring anomalies in respect of items on wbich I endeavoured to secure the imposition of higher duties. No one can say that I have wobbled on the fiscal question. I fancy the Minister is wobbling a little now. he was then longing, and he is wobbling right out of it. He said that he was not a wobbler on the fiscal question, but had invariably supported the imposition of the highest duties. Sir office then. difference ? markable difference in the attitude of the Minister then and now. He declared then that the Tariff could not wait, as industries were languishing. Now he says it must wait, and, moreover, that its amendment must be conditional upon the result of the referendum. There was no talk of that kind then. in most unmistakable language that the rectification of the Tariff should take place that session, and before the elections. There could, therefore, have been no attempt then to associate the new Protection with the question. gentlemen are in power it seems that there is no hurry about the thing at all. The industries can languish, and importationscan pour in. Sir JOH N FORREST -The Minister is quite comfortable. is. Why should he not be? Why should the wicked trouble him? The weary are at rest now, and this matter can afford to wait, and also be contingent on what is done in some other direction. The honourable member for Gwydir also spoke on that occasion, but there is not a word from him to-day. He was particularly concerned then about braids, laces, ribbons, : pose, mean a tremendous accession to the comfortable condition of the workers. The honourable member for Herbert was particularly troubled at that time about canned pineapples, declaring that hands were being discharged because the requisite duty was not imposed on those articles. The honourable member declared that we were paltering with this question, and trying to He saidevade it. Now that his champions are in office they are finding every conceivable excuse to tide them over this session, and well into the next year. It must be distinctly understood that what the Minister is now proposing is the postponement of the Tariff anomalies question for at least anHere is the opportunity for which other year. It cannot be got through before then, and by that time we shall be so near the elections that the Government will be quite sure to make tiie question of higher duties their trump card for the next election, as we are told to-day they did at the JOHN FOEEEST -He was not in last. We were told in the most unmistakable language by the honourable member for Hume that the Government got the Protectionist vote on the last occasion in the belief, and on the distinct promise, repeated throughout Australia, that the Tariff would be reopened and these matters rectified. votes ? honourable member's party promised the people that they should have Protection; but now that the party are in power through the votes of the people, there is no hurry about Protection.

Here is the earliest opportunity, and yet the remedy is not forthcoming. The honourable member still sits cheek by jowl with the Government. He said that he would have nothing to do with the Fusion, as they were selling Protection, simply because we could not reopen the Tariff before we had made inquiries to ascertain of what the anomalies consisted. Protection. member is in a somewhat tight corner. Every one knows, and admits, that he has always been a good Protectionist; but just how he can square himself to support the present Minister, who is letting pass the one opportunity which he declared should be taken at the earliest moment, I do not know. However, I am sure he will do it in his speech. He said, further, on that occasionIt appears to me that it should be the duty Minister also points me to the same source, of a Protectionist Government to compile a list and I take it, therefore, that the part of of anomalies as well as of the duties that were lost by one vote as soon as a Tariff comes into die new Protection which we did not quite force, and, having ascertained what, anomalies compass in the memorandum which we could not be dealt with by Ministerial action, sketched for the country is that which reto lose no time in introducing a Bill to rectify lates to the manipulation of the manufacthem.

I listened very attentively to the honmerce, corporations and combines, industrial orable member for Maribyrnong, to find legislation, and monopolies out what he meant by the new Protection. The only instance that he could give us Wages Board, or the award of a Court that was the boot trade award, which operated raises in some States, and could not operate in, It is said by these philanthropic gentlemen, say, Tasmania. That is exactly the case "" The price is raised in sympathy with, or as which we pledged ourselves at the last a consequence of, the increase of wages."" election to remedy at the earliest moment -Nothing is further from the truth. Therefore the honourable member has cited He went on to say that power would be the very case which we had in mind, among taken to regulate the prices charged to others, as arguing the necessity for a Fedeconsumers, and the profits which should be [224] ral co-ordinating power, which would make the awards fair as between State and State, and go even, further by instituting Wages Boards, where a State declined to do so. Before honourable members opposite make out their case as the "" true blues "" of the new Protection, they must go further than that, because that is precisely the length to which the Fusion intended to go. If that is all they want and mean by the new Protection, they would have got it all from the Fusion which they so much despised. We are now in the last days of the session, and the matter has been put off until it cannot be put off any longer, l t is put beyond the power of. this House, by the deliberate act of the Minister, to remedy existing anomalies, and honourable members must find some further excuse for sitting behind and voting for a Government who are thus delaying what they declared a year ago to be the most urgent, thing in Parliament.

Protectionists outside should understand the inward meaning of the policy of the Labour party, and not be led away by the general statements of those who have climbed into office on their backs. They should know that they are not to get increased Protection until they have consented to the regulation and control of their business to the extent that the rate of profit and prices will be fixed. Furthermore, they are to trust the Labour party. No doubt they will think that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. The redressing of anomalies is to be delayed until provision can be made for the regulation and control of busifixity regarding duties; they object to frenesses to which I have referred. I shall be ready to do all in my power to provide for the highest wages and best conditions being given to the workmen of Australia, because they are entitled to the best treatment that can be given to them; but it is to go too far to say to those who are conducting business enterprises, "" Your profits and your prices shall be such as Parliament may direct.""

The Labour party would control profits and prices, and leave to those engaged in commercial occupations mere'y the responsibility and the liabilities connected with them. When, therefore, Protectionists are asked to trust chief port of South Australia, and come the Government, they should remember that they are expected to hand their businesses over to the control of the Caucus. I congratulate the Government on having introduced this measure, which, though not exhaustive, is an honest attempt to remove Tariff anomalies. 1 do not think that more can reasonably be expected at this stage of the session, in view of the work that has already been done in providing for land taxation, a Commonwealtli note issue, Constitutional changes, and other important reforms, by a Government which has been only a few months on the Treasury bench.. It is proposed to deal with about seventy anomalies, and no one who is not in posession of the reports of the Customs officials can say whether there are still more to be dealt with. for Hume had a list. which he wishes to provide for do not affect anomalies in the sense in which I use the word. Commercial men will tell you that what they chiefly desire is some quent alterations of die Tariff, because of the uncertainty which is thus caused. That is generally acknowledged, as those who are acquainted with the literature of Tariff reform in America are aware. The Minister is best informed as to the difficulties of administering the Tariff. It is not surprising that friction should arise out of conflict of opinion as to the nature of the importations, but it is desirable to do all that is possible to remove causes for friction. It is not to be assumed that every rogue. But, do what we will, we cannot get rid of all sources of disagreement. I can understand that in Victoria the representatives of Victoria should desire the reopening of the Tariff, because for the last forty years the Age, in and out of season, has preached Tariff reform. Hardly a week elapses without the publication of one or more leading articles directed to that end. No doubt that newspaper has had a great deal to do with the creation of the strong Protectionist sentiment which has made Melbourne the leading manufacturing centre in Australia. But the Government has not time this session to deal with Tariff reform generally, and Victorian representatives must therefore possess themselves in patience a little longer. I represent the frequently into contact with merchants and shippers, and therefore know the difficulties which they have to meet. I give the Minister credit for a desire to do all that can fairly be done to remove, these difficulties, and assume that he has dealt with all the most important, if not all, the anomalies which create friction in administration.

No country which devotes its attention solely to those industries is more than a second or a third-rate nation, and we must be prepared tb see a development of manufactures, and of all branches of arts and science, in the Commonwealth.

I do not hope that we shall be able to frame a perfect Tariff next session, but I trust that we shall, at least, be able-to set to work upon it, and finally to build up a Tariff that will be satisfactory and beneficial to all sections of the people of this great Commonwealth. [3.42] -The one illuminating feature of the address to which we have just listened is the admission-for which I am afraid the honourable member for Hindmarsh's brother members of the Labour party will not thank him-that what is known as the old Protection is a delusion, a fraud, and a snare, or, to use his own words, simply a method of plundering the people. know what the new Protection is. the new Protection, of which the honourable member is such an ardent advocate, he is not able to assure the Committee that it will not also result practically in a plundering of the people. He does not even know what it is to be, how it is going to be applied, or of what it is to consist. He has left the Committee entirely in the dark, for the good and sufficient reason that he himself does not know what the new Protection is. thoroughly believes in it, but he has no idea what it means, and he is going to leave it to the people to say what it is. opposite do not know what it is, but they are going to have it. actly ; and if the honourable member himself is unable to tell the people the meaning of the new Protection, which he asks them to adopt, they, in turn, will have some difficulty in informing him what they understand by the term, when the coiners of the term do not know what it means. From a protectionist point of view it is rank heresy to say that the old Protection is robbery nnd plunder. Honourable members on this side, who think as I do, and declare Protection to be plunder and based on robbery, have been held up as objects of scorn to whom the term ""madmen"" might very properly be applied. Many years of argument and elucidation of facts have been spent by those opposed to the Protectionist policy in demonstrating that the effect is simply to rob the consumer and not to benefit the worker, and that the only people who can possibly benefit are the Tariff-protected employers of labour. There never was anything in the Protectionist principle to compel the employer to share the benefits with the employees. That has been one of my greatest objections to Protection, apart from the fallacy of the principle itself, and there is the further objection that Protection always places an added burden on the poorest classes of the community, those who depend on a daily wage. The honourable member for Maribyrnong declares that Protection is required for the manufacturer, the worker, and the consumer. Why has not Protection, wherever it has operated, had the effect of benefiting those three classes? VVe have always been assured that that was exactly what Protection was going to do; but now we have Protectionists, one after another, confessing that their pet policy has been an ignominious failure, and that the Free Traders have been right all along. How are we to protect the three classes in one process? The only way in which an employer can be benefited is by increased prices which the Tariff enables him to charge. There is no obligation on him to share those increased prices with his employees; but as soon as there is an obligation imposed by legislative means, he can He says that he only do so, by either further increasing the cost to the consumer or reducing his own profits. Whether he will consent to the latter course remains to be seen; it is not' in human nature to expect him to do it voluntarily. The only way to protect the consumer is to reduce prices; but as soon as that is done, the Protective Tariff is of no avail to the employer, for that is the last thing he desires, and we practically come back to the position from whicli we started, when there was no Protection at all. Protection can operate only to the advantage of one or two sections of the community at the expense of the rest of the community, by taking more out of the pockets of the people than they would otherwise be asked to pay-the consumer has to foot the bill all the time. Investigations show that the cost of living in late years has increased by 33\ per cent., or even more, with no corresponding increase in wages; and the natural result is a demand for legislation to compensate for the difference in the cost of living. able member attribute the increased cost of living ?",43,Elliot Johnson I F Not Sion The Honourable Member For Gippsland

303,Mr Tudor,"To what does the honorProtective duties, and the tendency of such duties to create monopolies, which arise out of restricted competition, and force up prices. Where prices are not actually forced up, the articles supplied are not of the former standard of quality, notably in the case of wearing apparel. I "" should have liked to hear, from the honourable member for Maribyrnong in particular, how he would propose to keep up profits and increase wages in protected industries and, at the same rime, safeguard the consumer from increased prices. He and others, apparently, forget that the consumers are principally the wage-earners. I always understood that the object of Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts was to secure a larger measure of benefit for the wage-earners in both protected and unprotected industries -were working capstan lathes from milling, These Wages Boards were called into existence to prevent the sweating that had grown up in the protected industries in Victoria. I have always been an advocate of the highest wages possible, because I recognise that the higher the wages the greater the spending power and the more prosperous the bulk of the people. The experience of other countries teaches us that the lowest wages prevail in countries where there is tlie highest' measure of Protection-wher e Tariffs are highest wages are lowest, sweating most pronounced, and the conditions of life, generally, least desirable. I should here like to read one or two quotations from an article which was originally contributed to the English Socialist newspaper, the Clarion, by Mr W. Potts, one of the delegates of the British Tariff Reform League, and was subsequently reprinted in the Sydney Worker of 27th January this year. This article describes industrial conditions in Germany, which is one of the most highly protected countries in the world. We have heard much from newspapers like the Age of the prosperity of the people of Germany; but direct news from that country does not justify the roseate pictures painted by local Protectionist organs. MT. Potts saysAs you are aware, I am a Socialist, holding no brief for either Protectionist or Free Trader. With reference to the unemployed, we have still abundant resources which the Germans have exhausted. I am convinced that protection does not provide a satisfactory solution of the unemployed problem. The organized efforts of employees, trade unions, and the municipalities have almost been perfected, and yet the records show that in Germany the evil is as great in proportion to the population as in England. That, I think, is a pretty heavy indictment of failure, so far as the workers of Germany are concerned. For instance, Berlin, with a population of less than three millions, has 140,000 unemployed in the records for 1909-figure s supplied to me by the officials. The records of the Labour Bureau, and the people we have seen waiting-in the rooms, prove that it is difficult to get work, and very difficult to keep it. The concentration of competitors at the bureau, the constant changing of men (as shown by the "" situations f ill e d "" record), without diminishing the volume of unemployment, leave no doubt on this matter. Wages are lower for skilled and unskilled. He states some of the wages earned, referring, for instance, to a small arms factoryAt a small arms factory, on piece work, carpenters, turners, fitters, and joiners would make from 4d. to 6d. per hour. Women-3,00 0 hands. machines at 2d. to 3d. per. hour, 200,000 out in building trades fighting for £d. per hour advance. That is not a very exhilarating picture of prosperity. The spending power is reduced by large and increasing taxes on tea, coffee, corn, flour, coal, electric light, beef, matches, and clothing.. Bread is a mixture of wheat and rye. In Berlin, horse beef sells at 4d. to 7d. per l b . ; cereals are about the same price as here y boots, clothes, hats, caps, & c , slightly clearer than English for same quality. The food is dear, coarse, and unpleasant. We certainly have not much to complain of on that score in Australia at present;. but, as like causes produce like effects, I take it that it is only a question of time, as population increases tlie pressure on subsistence, when ive shall probably reach the same standard of deterioration. As to the conditions of the workers themselves, Mr Potts saysEvery workman is drilled and reduced to the machine stage, or drilled and educated up to it, and in the healthiest and. most commodious work-shops there exists an industrial despotism which would be intolerable to an English workman-servilit y strained to a degree. Apparently that is one of the results of their protective policy. We do not want to see conditions of that kind prevail here.. We have been reared in an atmosphere of freedom, which, I am sorry to say, is being gradually encroached upon year by year by some of those who, unfortunately for the best interests of this country, sit upon the Treasury benches of the Federal, and one or two of the State, Parliaments. I am afraid that that great measure of freedom, about which we have been able to boast with so much justification in the past,",44,Elliot Johnson I F Not Sion The Honourable Member For Gippsland
304,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"T ois gradually being undermined, and that presently, if we have a continuance of the domination of political labour unions, as at present constituted, and with their present restrictive and coercive ideals and aims, we shall see our boasted freedom grow less and less, until very little of it is left. It is a peculiar thing that while labour men in this country are calling out for Protection, those who have lived under a protective regime in other countries are crying out just as emphatically against it. I find the same authority saysI went to Germany a Socialist, and a Socialist I remain on my return.. I saw nothing whatever whilst I was away to convince me that the Tariff benefited the workman, and all the Labour men and Socialists I met or heard from were disbelievers in Protection. The men who have had experience of a protective system all their lifetime are denouncing it, and asking for a change to another system, under which they can get more freedom and less restriction. I realize the futility of debating the motion now before the Committee, where I am as one crying out alone in the wilderness, but I take this opportunity of raising my protest once more against the cost of living being further increased to the people by means of added burdens in the form of protective duties. The complaint already is that the cost of living is far too high-that it has been unduly increased by the Tariff legislation already passed by the votes of Labour representatives in this Parliament. Although this Bill is said to be only for the rectification of anomalies, I see that in one or two instances advantage has been taken to introduce indirectly, and, in some cases, directly, increases in the Tariff. I have always protested against protective Tariffs, because I do not believe that they conduce to the benefit of the country. Rather do they unduly harass, hamper, and place burdens' upon the backs of those sections of the people who are least able to bear them. Tariff taxes invariably fall, not upon the wealthy, but upon the poorer classes of the community. Where revenue has to be obtained by means of a Tariff, the taxation must be put upon articles which go most generally into consumption, and that means articles 'which are most generally in demand by the wage-earning classes, who form the great majority of the people. While I Object to it as an unsound principle and an interference with the liberty of the subject, my greatest objection to Protection, which has hitherto been purely in the interests of the manufacturers, has always been that it has imposed heavy burdens upon the poorest classes, whom we ought to do our best to relieve of taxation, and in whose interests we ought to legislate, in order to give them better wages and better conditions of life. However, one voice on this side of the question has, I recognise, very little weight in this Committee, where the great majority are pledged to Tariff Protection up to the hilt. But I take this opportunity of recording my protest against the iniquitous Tariff burdens that so heavily press upon the wage-earners of this country, and asserting again those principles which I have espoused ever since I . entered political life, and of stating that my belief in them remains unshaken. I am convinced that they are as sound to-day as ever they were, and that ultimately, after we have passed through various stages of oppressive restriction, there will be another swing of the pendulum in the direction of freedom. That day, will, I hope, dawn at no very distant date. I congratulate the Minister on simply bringing down this measure at this late stage of the session. We have had much more important .matters to deal with than the one now before the Committee. We have passed the Bills dealing with them, as we told die electors that we should. That task has taken nearly all the session; and that is the reason why the Minister did not bring this proposition down earlier. We are prepared to put up with the consequences of our action, and I feel sure that at the end of three years the electors will have fully realized that neither Free Trade nor Protection will prove a panacea for all the ills from which the people of our party have been suffering for so long. I listened to the tirade of abuse against Protection uttered by the honourable member for Lang; but let me ask honourable members what Free Trade has ever done for the masses in any country where it has been, adopted. In Great Britain a large number of the workers are on the verge of starvation. The late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and Mr Balfour argued the point 'whether there were 8,000,000 or 12,000,000 people in the Old Country in that condition. Blatchford told us that there were 12,000,000. Mr Bryce, now British Ambassador in America, said there were 13,000,000. Surely those figures are sufficient to prove that Free Trade is of no use to the workers. If we' turn to the United States",45,Elliot Johnson I F Not Sion The Honourable Member For Gippsland
305,Mr Laird Smith (Denison) [4.6],"and examine the conditions under which the worker is working there, as described by Upton Sinclair, or by Mr Stead in his work, / / Christ Came to Chicago, or Satan's Invisible World Revealed, we find a state of affairs almost intolerable for any value only ^15,000,000 goes in wages, citizen to live under. has not cured those evils. but Free Trade has not done so. Mr VV. ELLIOT JOHNSON -Protectio n has intensified them. The old Protection has simply built up manufactories within the country and made it possible for us to regulate them within our own borders. That is the advantage of Protection over Free Trade; but we propose introducing.a system of Protection that will enable us to deal effectively with the whole problem. The new Protection will protect the wage-earner and the consumer as well as the manufacturer. Although the honourable member for Hindmarsh could not define the meaning of new Protection, I am sure we shall have no trouble in putting our principles into pracus in power. I ask any fair and reasontice. An honourable member on the other side of the House interjected, "" Who provides the spending power?"" My reply is that the worker provides it every time, meaning by the worker either the captain of labour or the man performing the work on the lowest rung of the ladder. It is the worker that produces the wealth of the country. work for him for a week for nothing, with the promise of a reward at the end of the week. The master has the value of the labour done in the early part of the week for the whole of the week free of interest. Some of them have it for a' month. 1 know a firm in my electorate that do not pay their hands until the end of each month. The Government are also sinners in that respect. Employers who pursue that principle have the full use of the wealth produced and pay the men no interest for it. Let us see how much the workers are getting of the wealth produced. Sidney Webb, lecturer on political economy at the London College, tells us that they get only one-third of what they actually produce. Michael Fliirscheim says that in protected America they get only one-tenth of what they actually produce. That is altogether unfair and unjust. Mr Knibbs tells us that raw products of a value of ^52,000,000 go into the factories of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and South Australia, and are turned out at an enhanced value of ^86,000,000, representing an added value of ^34,000,000. Of that increase of. ^3,500,000 is absorbed in interest, and from whom we want to get a little backthe man who is reaping the benefit of the protective Tariff. By our new Protection policy we propose getting at that gentleman, and I think it is nearly time we did. Of course the Protectionists voted for us at the last election, because they knew they could get nothing from the Fusion. Nature has demonstrated that no hybrid can produce progeny; neither can a fiscal hybrid Government produce any policy that will protect a country or its manufactures. The Protectionists Of Australia voted for the Labour party because they knew that when we had placed our most important measures on the statute-book we would turn our attention to Protection and carry out the policy that we told them we should carry out if they did us the honour to place able man how the Minister could frame an amended Tariff suitable for all concerned and deal with every existing anomaly in the short time at his disposal this session? l t is practically impossible for him to do so. I have listened attentively to the criticism of the honourable member for Parramatta, but of course he wants something with Any master can get a man to which to go to the ladies' meetings and on to the hustings. He tried to put into our mouths statements not warranted by the facts. We are prepared to go on the platforms of Australia and justify the new Protection. We have no fear of the result. When I interjected that it would not be wise for us to give the Protectionists all that they want before we took the referendum, I did so because I know the apathy displayed by the people if they are contented. They will not vote when they are quite satisfied. We are told repeatedly by members on the other side that it is owing to the apathy of certain classes of the people that we are in office, and I want to take care that that apathy shall not prevail in the ranks of our own supporters. I wish to be able to say to the people, "" If you desire Protection you must assist us to place on the statute-book the new Protection, which will give you the assistance In our so-called protective country that you desire, and will provide for the regulation of prices, wages, and conditions.""

It was unfair and unjust of the Leader of the Opposition to say that we are offering a bribe to the Protectionists. straightforwardly with the electors. have no desire to put on the statute-book a measure which will benefit only the manuterations which could have been deferred, facturers. Our wish is to improve the condition of every member of the community. An Irishman, in New York, when asked a dollar for some potatoes, said, "" I could buy them in Ireland for sixpence."" The reply was, "" Why did you not stay in Ireland then?"" to which he answered, "" I could not get the.sixpence."" I ask, What is the good of Free Trade if there is not work enough for the people of the country tinder that policy? What is the use of cheapness and freedom if the people have not money with which to buy what they need? The old Protection and the old Free Trade were tweedledum and tweedledee, and I am a fiscal atheist in regard to both. But that is not my position in regard to the new Protection, which I feel sure will do all that we desire. I am glad that the Minister has not brought down a larger schedule of alterations. We shall be able to go to the people, and tell them on the word of the Government that, after the constitutional changes have been agreed to, the Tariff will be remodelled so as to make Australia what the Labour party desires it to be, the home of a prosperous nation. Protectionist I endorse what the honourable member for Hume said in expressing his strong disappointment with the measure. The honourable member for Parramatta quoted from a speech which I made last year on the subject of anomalies. My views have not changed since then. I am not surprised that the Bill has such a restricted purpose, because the usual answer given by the Minister to deputations was that it was his intention to provide only for the removal of office difficulties. There high duties performed their part of are two kinds of Tariff anomalies, those which cause office difficulties, and those which prejudice local industries, such as the nail industry, the making of apparel, and others that have been mentioned. I hoped that the Minister would have provided for the removal of anomalies of the second class to some extent. Last year the honourable member for Hume read a long list of anomalies compiled by Customs officials. Had those anomalies been dealt with, great relief would have been given to many industries which are now suffering. As for the anomalies rectified by the Bill, they might very well have been left over until .the Tariff could be dealt with on wider We are dealing lines. It is a pity that we should have this We discussion regarding a proposal affecting merely administration, and instituting alfor another twelve months. I agree with the honourable member for Hume that the Protectionists of Victoria cast their votes either for 'members of the Labour party or for candidates standing in the interests of Protection; they saw no hope of getting a Protectionist revision of. the Tariff from the Fusion Government. It is not surprising, however, that the Labour party is dealing with this matter in the manner under discussion. When the last Tariff was under consideration, a large number of Victorian members returned as Protec-; tionists, did not consistently vote Protection, and many of the higher duties were carried by the votes of. Labour members who were Free Traders, but were induced, to support protective proposals because of the promise of the Deakin Government that new Protection would be provided for. On several occasions inquiries were made as to that Government's position as regards new Protection by the then Opposition, the present High Commissioner"" askingWhether in considering the Tariff and the duties fixed from day to day the House is to regard the system of new Protection as part of the understanding upon which the duties were determined. To that, the honourable member for Ballarat, who was then Prime Minister, repliedThe Ministry put forward the matters referred to by the honourable member as a united proposal, the duties on the one side and the new Protection upon the other. That was a bargain, and it was deliberately stated, on more than one occasion. The Free Trade members of the Labour party who voted for the contract, and, as a member of the party by which the promise of new Protection was given, I have always felt ashamed that the other part was never performed.' Unsatisfactory though the Tariff is, the duties would not have been as high as they are, had it not been for the promise given by the honourable member for Ballarat, which was repeated by other Ministers. Memoranda were laid on the table showing what was intended in regard to new Protection, and setting out the terms",47,Johnson Protectio N Over ^15 000 000 Goes To The Gentleman

319,Mr Wise,"I am dissatisfied with theposal is brought forward which he thinks will raise the fiscal controversy. Observe the sneer at the members of my old party and the present leader of the Opposition in Sir George's Reid's next remarkThis is a great climb down for those who talked of admitting us into the ranks of the Liberal party. He went on to sayBefore the fusion the Free Traders in the direct Opposition requested MT . Joseph Cook to make our position under the clause perfectly clear to Mr Deakin. We pointed out that if an alteration in the Tariff was proposed which raised the fiscal issue as between Free Traders and Protectionists, that we Free Traders held ourselves perfectly free to vote according to our convictions. To make assurance doubly sure, when the united party met, I then defined our position again before the whole of the members of the new party. I pointed out to them that it would be most undesirable to leave any room for future recriminations as to the observance or non-observance of the basis of fusion. adoption of a quasi hostile motion like that of I told them that it must be understood distinctly that in becoming members of the new party we have agreed to a fiscal truce, and if the Tariff question is re-opened to rectify any alleged anomaliesHe would not even admit that there were any anomalieswe have reserved our right to vote in accordance witb our own convictions and those of our constituents. The fiscal truce is not to last only the Fusion Government. What hope had during the present ParliamentThat was the last Parliamentbut during the next one. Notwithstanding this statement, the honorof able member for Parramatta thinks that I for that should join the party on behalf of which such a declaration was made. The Government party is the only party in the of the terms of the fusion is that' the muchpresent Parliament in respect of which for ninequestion Protectionists can have any hope, and beby honourable members sitting on this side of fore I condemn them.

It that the then Prime Minister was going to will be remembered that last session, whilst be true to his promise to rectify Tariff the Fusion Government were in power, the anomalies. That promise, however, was honourable member for Hume submitted a not fulfilled. The honourable member went motion in the following termsThat, in the opinion of this House, the Government should proceed, without delay, to introduce a Bill for an Act lo remove the anomalies existing in the present Customs and Excise Tariff Acts, and to add such other duties as may be deemed necessary. To that motion, the honourable member for Fawkner moved as an amendmentThat all the words after the word "" House"" be lef t out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" the Government's declaration that 'consideration is being given to the adjustment of anomalies in the Tariff, and any Bill on the subject would, as a matter of course, safeguard the interests of the producers and manufacturers of the Commonwealth. Each anomaly will be dealt with according to its character, the general policy of the existing Tariff being maintained,' is satisfactory."" Speaking to the motion, the honourable member for Fawkner saidI hope that the Government will not lose any time in bringing forward their proposals ia regard to them. That was in July of last year, and the Fusion Government had the whole session before them. He went on tb sayThe anomalies are more likely to be dealt with if the amendment be carried than by the the honourable member for Hume. I have great sympathy with the desire to have anomalies rectified; and I shall always impress upon the Government the necessity of dealing with them as early as possible. We ought to help those who are at present suffering, many of them, I know, considerably. Yet, although that speech ' was made in July of last year, nothing was done by the honourable member of securing from that Ministry any amendment of the Tariff? The position taken up by Sir George Reid was emphasized in the course debate by the honourable member Parkes, who saidI t is a matter of common knowledge that one vexed which has divided the House years shall be left at rest for a time doubt the Prime Minister, who has the ordering of the Government business, will on to sayI have always seen great difficulty in the use of the word "" anomalies.""

I desire to do the honourable member for Gippsland justice, and to say that he does not believe in doing any such thing. That being so, his place is not behind this Government, but anywhere else. honourable member for Parramatta has been good enough to make a second speech; and I do not desire my position to be misrepresented. When the Government choose to bring in a Bill to nationalize or control industries, in some way I do not approve, I shall be prepared to vote against them. I am not prepared at the present time to consider the details of such measures. We are now only at the stage at which we have been, I am sorry to say, for the last three years-the stage of promising and of stating what ought to be, and shall be, done. The fault I find with the Leader of the Opposition is that he gave his pledge in the House that he would place the new Protection alongside the old Protection as a united proposal. He induced honourable members on this side to vote for the old Protection on the promise that he would give the new Protection. He cajoled them -no , I shall not say cajoled them, because I believe he was absolutely sincere -bu t he brought down a proposal, and stated that it would be absolutely necessary to have an amendment of the Constitution in order to carry out his promise; indeed, he gave the actual words on which he was prepared to appeal to the people. The fault I find with him is that his subsequent action took away the opportunity to carry out his promise; and that is why I do not sit behind the honourable member, and never shall as long as he is in his preindustrial power we desire be given to us, sent company.

We have to admit, perhaps, that the language of the honourable member for Hume to-day was, at times, pretty strong, and, owing to that honourable member's peculiar position, some latitude may be allowed him in this respect. The honourable member has made this question his principal study; and, while we may differ from him, we can quite understand some strong feeling on his part. Of course, a proper revision of the Tariff at this stage is impossible. We have neither the time nor the temper for the work, after an arduous session of four or five months, in which the physical endurance of all of us has been severely tested. There cannot be a revision of any thoroughness until, in March next, this Parliament is given power to make industrial laws for the regulation of wages and conditions. ferenda be not carried, there will be 110 more Tariff revision? ber would, doubtless, like me to give an answer which, on some future occasion, might be used to my confusion; and, at an earlier period of my political life, I . might have fallen into the trap. enough ! be of any use to the honourable member, I shall say that, while I agree with the Minister in his present proposals, unless the not one vote of mine will be cast for any increase of Protection in any manufacture",52,Johnson Protectio N Over ^15 000 000 Goes To The Gentleman

There are protected employers who have no regard or sympathy with others who are not protected, and the same may be said' in regard to workmen; and it will behove the people, next March, to extend a helping-hand, so that the benefits of the Tariff may be extended to all. I should like to mention one or two items, representing anomalies, which require rectification. I made out a list of seventy-three; and, notwithstanding all I could do, I could not reduce them below forty. It will be realized that, if every honcut the material. There is, however, an orable member came forward with forty anomalies, we should be called upon to make a thorough revision of the Tariff. However, I should like to call attention to 6-inch iron pipes, on which there is a duty of 20 per cent. They came in under manufactures of metals, n.e.i. The last Parliament recognised that those duties were not sufficient to prevent the importation of iron pipes, which are brought here in many different ways. .A large importing firm in Brisbane used to bring out a great deal of drapery and other articles, and imported iron pipes as ballast. The manufacturers in the Old Country turn out iron pipes at very little above the price of pig-iron, and ships are willing to bring them out practically as ballast. Parliament then made the duty £ 2 on the general Tariff and ^ 1 15s. for the United Kingdom; but the anomaly is that it takes about three and a half wroughtiron pipes to weigh as much as one castiron pipe; and those who import wroughtiron pipes get them in at not much over one-fourth of the duty which the cast-iron pipes cany. That is an anomaly which the Minister might have taken in hand, but he has not done so; and I do not expect that any argument of mine will lead him to alter bis decision. The question of wearing apparel might also have been considered. Manufacturers of wearing apparel in Australia are at a great disadvantage at certain periods of the year. The manufacturers and retailers in Europe are willing to get rid of their stock at the end of the season at any price. It is brought out here, and interferes to a great extent with the manufacture in Australia of women's garments and also of men's overcoats. The Minister says he does not call that an anomaly, but I think it is, as we have not made sufficient provision to prevent that sort of dumping in our markets. I was on a deputation that waited on the honourable member for Kooyong when he was Minister of Trade and Customs, to show him that the existing Tariff was nol sufficient tb meet the needs of Australia in that regard. I admit that once we trench on questions of that sort, the reopening of the whole Tariff might be demanded; but I think that case might have been considered as an anomaly. Another matter is' that of corks. Many people deride the idea of protecting the cork industry here, saying that we do not grow the cork, and that it simply means importing machines and employing certain individuals to anomaly, inasmuch as corks for very large bungs, which come out altogether unworked, pay the same duty as finished corks made for medicine bottles. We might attempt to define the difference between an irregularity, and an anomaly in the Tariff; but I shall not attempt to do so now. Some people have charged me with not being a sufficiently strong Protectionist; but, on the other hand, I have been accused of being a Prohibitionist, and I would prohibit the importation of any article which was manufactured here of a sufficiently high standard, and in sufficient quantity, to commercially supply Australia. While I am disappointed that this motion does not go further, the Minister can safely promise us that, after next March, when he is empowered to extend Protection all round, and pass proper industrial laws, he will bring down a real revision of the Tariff. I do not think it will be necessary to have anything like the last revision; but, where experience has shown that importations are going on as merrily as ever, I should like to see fairly heavy protective duties imposed. Knowing the Minister and the Ministry, I do not think we shall be disappointed. I am sure that, in the interests of the people, the question will be grappled with in no uncertain way next session. In spite of what the papers say, I do not blame the Opposition for twitting us and gibing at us on account of what has happened in this case. I remember when i was in Opposition, and am willing to allow to others the same liberty that I then? demanded for myself. I am more concerned with tlie interests of the people outside; and I can assure them that, afternext session, when we have acquired the right to make industrial laws, they will he gluttons if they are not satisfied with the Tariff which the Minister of Trade and Customs will give them. and Customs) [5.8] I shall not indulge in ancient history in my reply, and purposely refrained from doing so in moving the motion. I thought it far better to take the position exactly as it is to-day, and I distinctly announced that this proposal was not considered by the Government or by mvself to be Tariff revision. I have made mv position perfectly clear in reply -to deputations, stating that, before revising the Tariff, I would wait until this Parliament had asked the people what they intended to do when the referenda were submitted to them. I also made that perfectly clear on the hustings, when I appealed to the people for votes at the last election. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports said that he intended tb submit a great number of anomalies. . I have no doubt that other honourable.members could do the same, and once we began the work of Tariff revision, pure and simple, instead of dealing with what can be defined as anomalies from a departmental point of view, we should be landed in a re-opening of the whole Tariff. T said the same thing when speaking last session to the motion of the honourable member for Hume. The Ministry thought it advisable, in the interests of carrying the referenda which they intend to submit to the people, that that revision should not be now undertaken. I move That item 4 be amended by omitting the whole of the item and inserting in its stead the following item :"" Amylic Alcohol and Fusel Oil :-(A ) Denatutions. I suppose about seven-eighths of rated in accordance with Departmental By-laws, free; (B) not denaturated in accordance with Departmental By-laws, per gallon, 14s."" That provision is exactly the same as far as the 14s. per gallon duty is concerned. At present amylic alcohol is being delivered free for use in a licensed warehouse in the manufacture of ore concentrates, and the object of introducing this amendment is to give the mining industry an opportunity of using the alcohol without having the trouble of keeping a Customs officer there all the time. We, therefore, provide that it may be denaturated in accordance with departmental by-laws. Motion agreed to. Amendments in items 71, 72, IO6A, 107 (with a verbal amendment), 115, and 121 agreed to. That item 123 be amendedBy omitting from sub-item ( D ), the words "" Ribbons, Galloons not being bindings "", and the words "" Boxed Robes when not shaped or sewn "" . By inserting in sub-item (D), after the words "" Lace for Attire"" , the words "" exceeding eighteen .inches in width "". By inserting in sub-item (D), after the words ""Lace Flouncings"", the words ""exceeding eighteen inches in width"". By inserting in sub-item (D), after the words ""Millinery and Dress Nets"", the words ""exceeding eighteen inches in width "" . By inserting in sub-item (D), after the words "" Embroideries in the piece"", the words "" exceeding eighteen inches in width "". -This amendment involves very considerable alteration of existing items. The idea is. to make item 123 apply only to those goods which exceed 18 inches in width, and to bring goods'not within that category into item 134A, under the higher duties of 25 and-15 per cent. That will be a source of the greatest difficulty to merchants and warehousemen. While the amendment may rectify some difficulties and anomalies, it will create a large number of others. If we discriminate as to the width of laces for attire, lace flouncings, millinery, and dress nets, and such articles, it will be found necessary to examine a large number of packages,and open up great quantities of goods to see that the width is not exceeded. I suggest that items 123 and 134 be amalgamated, and a common duty made applicable, in order to bring about greater uniformity, and facilitate business operathe importations under those two items would consist of goods which cannot be manufactured in Australia. I am desirous that if any of those articles bytheir importation injuriously affect Australian industries tiiey. should be made subject to a protective or higher duty, and that the balance should be subjected to a revenue duty at the rates of 15 and 10 per cent. Whilst we desire to assist, if possible, the local makers of badges and ornaments, yet at the same time we wish to tax as lightly as possible such things as ribbons, galloons, laces for attire, flouncing, braids, and so on. which are the raw material of tlie makers of apparel. I shall not move an amendment, because of the difficulty of dealing satisfactorily with the matter, but I think that the Minister's views coincide with mine, and I ask him to re-",53,Johnson Protectio N Over ^15 000 000 Goes To The Gentleman

[5.18] I agree with the honourable member for Kooyong as to the undesirability of taxing heavily raw material. But those who have approached me on this subject have admitted that it is difficult to-specify in every case what is raw material, and what is a manufactured article. the expert of the Department be instructed to make a selection I would draw attention to the use of very carefully done. By the present-day fashions a great deal of work is given to our own people in connection with the braiding of women's garments, and we should be careful not to -allow this to be taken away by the use of imported gimps and trimmings which are not raw material.. Braid is, in itself, a raw material, but when it has been worked into an ornament it is a finished article. Importers are nottoo particular, and the interests of our local people must be considered. I think that it would be safest ito adopt the suggestion of the Customs officials, who are well-informed in this matter. I agree that there is a wide distinction between raw materials and finished or partlyfinishedarticles. and Customs) [5-21] -The honourable member for Kooyong was good enough to submit his proposal to me this morning, and I have obtained some information on the subject from the Department, and will have the amalgamation of items 12 3D and 134A considered. If we can in any way lessen the burden of makers who have been injured by unfair competition from abroad, we should do so, allowing raw material to come in as cheaply as possible. I shall have the matter reconsidered in the light of what the honourable member has said. Motion agreed to.

This is simply a little referendum machinery Bill providing for voting at a referendum, independently of a general election. The Bill is rendered necessary by section 64 of the Electoral Act, which relates to the closing of the rolls; and the object is to evade technical and administrative difficulty in the way of closing the rolls on the day that the writ is issued, just in the same way as if there were a general election. Persons entitled to vote will be enrolled prior to the issue of the writ, in the same way as under the Electoral Act, and those who are not then enrolled will be as soon as possible afterwards, and so lose none of their rights. Supplementary rolls containing the names of all electors which do not appear on the principal rolls will be issued. Without indulging in any loose talk at this late stage of the session, I submit the motion. "" loose"" talk; but I hope he will not ask us to pass a ""loose"" Bill. I shall be glad to be informed what provision is made, if any, for scrutiny during the voting. On each of the two occasions on which a referendum has been taken, it has been associated with the election of members, and the scrutineering on behalf of the rival candidates has been available, in order to check imposition. In the present instance, however, there will be no candidates, and, consequently, no scrutineers representing, candidates. The Bill contains no power on the part of the Governor General, this Government, or any one else, to appoint scrutineers; and the Minister will see that, Avithout safeguards of the ordinary kind, the door is left open to possible abuses which cannot be discoAered r or checked. This is a serious matter, inasmuch as all the ordinary agencies attending an election contest are absent, and, apparently, there will be nobody present but the returning officer and the noil clerk.",56,Johnson Protectio N Over ^15 000 000 Goes To The Gentleman

If a man says "" No, "" when asked by the presiding officer whetiier he has voted before, no one is able at that stage to prove whether his statement is cortice would be some check upon those who rect or not. In ordinary polling-booths, in large centres, where there are two men at each table, I should like to be convinced of the necessity for the appointment of a Commonwealth scrutineer before I agree to sanction the extra expense._ Of course, parties could not be so definitely divided as to allow them to appoint scrutineers, and if the appointment is made by die Federal Government it will simply mean the. addition of a third Commonwealth official, where two can do all that is necessary. I think it would be a good thing to have scrutineers. Although the State Governor has power to appoint a scrutineer, he may net exercise that power. It is optional with ' him. sort, especially where the wishes of the States may not be in accord with the wishes of the Commonwealth, it would be reasonable for both to be represented by scrutineers. I do not say that there is any likelihood of wrongdoing, but there ought to be security. I have always thought that the system which we have adopted, and which is to be continued in this instance, offers almost a premium for wrong-doing, inasmuch as there is no scrutiny whatever as to whether a person votes wrongly or more than once. I have called the attention of the Minister to that great flaw in our procedure, and yet he proposes to perpetuate it in this case. He told the House that he was going to make an examination of certain districts to see if there was any cause for complaint. I do not know whether he has done so or not. Minister has made no report to the House on the subject. In Western Australia, a procedure was adopted which we might very well follow. for every division, in addition to certifying the result, had to make a report on the election, stating whether any one, so far appoint all necessary poll clerks. as he could judge by comparing the rolls at the different polling booths, had, apparently, voted twice. If any one had, apparently, voted twice, he would give the name in his report, and the matter would be handed over to the Law Officers to deal with. Several prosecutions took place, and I think there were some convictions; but even if no convictions followed, the pracare not too particular what they do. In a system like ours, where tens of thousands of people vote, it seems to be absolutely necessary to have a careful scrutiny of that kind. I do not say for a moment that wrong-doing does take place, but it is a fact that we have no check of any sort to ascertain Whether people vote once, twice, or twenty times at different polling booths, as unknown persons could easily do in a big city. Under present arrangements there is no chance of their being punished for doing it. I thought the Minister would give his attention to the matter, as he seemed to be very anxious to look into it ; but if he has done so, he has never told any one what conclusions he has come to, or whether he found that anything wrong did take place. I only hope that he can In . all matters of this report that everything is all right. able member is going beyond the question before the Chair. cedure is to be perpetuated in the taking of the referenda.

Under the Commonwealth Electoral Act, parts of which are incorporated for the purposes of the taking of a referendum, the returning officer may permit extra poll clerks, or any persons he likes, to be present at the polling, but they will not have defined duties. T do not think the Act contemplates persons in the nature of scrutineers being present, unless express permission is given. Part The returning officer XI . of the Electoral Act, including section 134, is incorporated in the Referendum Act.

Honourable members generally are desirous that nothing shall occur to invalidate the voting for which we are providing, and it seems to me that the non-appointment of scrutineers would not have that effect.

Of course, in the case of a prosecution there might be a second witness to identify or to give corroborative evidence, but the voting will be scrutinized at the central electoral office. sult of that on the last occasion? where necessary.

The words proposed to be omitted from that Act are printed in erased type, whilst the words proposed to be added are printed in black type. I had occasion yesterday, in submitting a resolution relating to Tariff anomalies, to point out that my predecessor in office in all probability had gone over the whole ground relating to the matter, and doubtless the same remark will apply to this measure. The questions with which this measure deals were brought under his notice when he held office, and doubtless had the Ministry of which he was a member remained in power, he would have introduced a somewhat similar measure. The original Customs Act was introduced the reby the late Honourable C. C. Kingston, and under it we took extensive powers to deal with imports. The Department of Trade and Customs, .under sections 50, 51, S3, and 56 of that Act, has control over all classes of goods imported into Australia, but it has practically no power to deal with exports. Some time after the Act had been in operation it was found lhat some of its provisions in regard to.the prohibition of imports were rather weak, and that once prohibited imports had gained entry into Australia we had no power to follow them up.

421,Mr Tudor,"I do not say that, but goods into Australia, we should insist uponThere has been a great outcry ih Australia, as well as in other lands, in regard to the necessity for preserving bird life. Honourable members are at one, I think, in the belief that we should take steps to protect, as far as possible, our native birds, which have hitherto been ruthlessly slaughtered, and that we should, if possible, prohibit their exportation. again, the statement has been made that gold stolen from some of our mining fields has been exported to the East and elsewhere. Under this Bill we shall have power to deal with the illicit export of that mineral. Not long ago a case was brought under the notice of the Department where a traveller booked his luggage from one capital city to another, and thence to another, and an inspection of his luggage showed that in this way he had been evading the payment of certain Customs duties. We shall be able by means of this measure to assist in the maintenance of certain laws now in operation, and to prevent losses of revenue which have occurred in this way. We take power to prohibit the export of certain goods from one State to another. If it is -wrong for certain goods to be exported to an oversea destination, it is certainly wrong that they should be sent from one State to another. . interfere with the Quarantine Act? It is a new provision. provision, but I do not think that it will clash in any way with the Quarantine Act. The power to which I refer is contained in clause 5. At the present time we have no power to deal with adulterated goods. We may say that they shall not be imported into Australia, but we have no power to prevent their manufacture here, or to prevent goods that are unfit for human consumption or use being sent from one State to another. Clause5 repeals section 167 of the principal Act, and I am sure that legal members opposite will agree that it is an improvement in the procedure. It will give importers the power, practically, to have their cases dealt with by any Court of competent jurisdiction other than the High Court, to which they are compelled to go under the present law. The High Court has decided that the section, -in its present form, is useless for all that the Department is taking too much practical purposes-that importers are not advantaged by its retention, and will not be prejudiced by its emission. Another objection to the section is that all deposits paid in when the Tariff was introduced had to be paid to a Trust Fund, to be transferred periodically to the Consolidated Revenue; and this has caused a great deal of unnecessary trouble to the Department There were rendered necessary a number of unnecessary entries, and additional bookThen keeping; and it was quite possible, while the Tariff was under consideration, for importers, if they so desired, to put the Treasurer in such a position that he would have no revenue at his command. The clause will enable the money to be paid direct into the Consolidated Revenue, and if the importer, after due notice, desires to have his case heard by any Court other than the High Court, and he is successful in his action, the money can just as readily be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue as out of a Trust Fund. If a question of constitutional import arises that should be dealt with by the High Court, the Department will have power .to select that tribunal Tbe clause also provides that any action must be taken within six months from the passing of a new Tariff. Under clause 6, power is given to question persons in the case of prohibited imports and exports in the same way as they may be questioned now in regard to dutiable goods. This is to repair what was evidently an omission in the Act; and clause 7 extends the powers of search in the same manner. Clause8 extends the time for warrants issued by the State collectors from one month to three. There has been a considerable amount of trouble and annoyance caused from time to time, in distant parts of the Commonwealtli, owing to the warrants issued having operation for only one month; and the extension is to meet cases in the northern parts of Western Australia and Queensland. Clause9 repeals section 210 of the principal Act, -and may be regarded as one of the most important in the Bill. Under the present law an officer of Customs may, without warrant, arrest any person whom he has reasonable ground to believe to be guilty of smuggling; and the clause extends that power to persons who are believed to be exporting or importing any prohibited exports or imports, or unlawfully conveying or having in their possession any smuggled or prohibited goods.

While, as a rule, a Court has the fullest power to deal with regulations, and to test their reasonableness, if a specific provision in an Act gives discretion to a Minister, the Court will not interfere with its exercise, and that would be the case under that clause. determined that, in the opinion of the Minister, it was harmful to the Commonwealth that greasy wool should be exported. It might be contended that if greasy wool were scoured and prepared in Australia it would give employment to the people of the Commonwealth. That argument might be advanced a step further to the preparation of tops, and from tliat to the preparation of yarn, and from that to the actual manufacture of the fabric, a most desirable achievement, if practicable. By this means, it might be determined, by the imposition of embarrassing conditions, to discourage the export of greasy wool, and deal a reeling blow to the greatest of our industries. It is. difficult to believe that any man charged with the responsibility of administering a great Department like the Customs Department would be guilty of such a short-sighted policy, but if any Minister, by the strength of his prejudice, came to that determination, it would be most difficult to dissuade him. ber think that any Government that did that would live? the fact that, during the last election, I was asked at several meetings whether I was in favour of the imposition of an export duty on wool. Mi. TUDOR -Was the honourable member ever asked that in the State clays? ber such a question being put in those days, but I was asked it on several platforms during the last Senate election, and deputations have waited on some Ministers urging them to impose export duties on various articles of produce. I have been invited to impose them on hides and skins. It has even been suggested in certain well-known circles that we should impose export duties on wheat and butter. is unwise for us in these days, when suggestions of that sort are put forward as almost coming within the region of practical politics, to repose in any Minister such a sweeping discretion. I would suggest that, so far as that particular clause is concerned, and perhaps as regards other clauses relating to exportation, the proclamation should be brought officially under the notice of Parliament, and that it should be within the power of either, or both, Houses, by resolution, to modify, or even nullify, it. The' power now proposed Suppose that' it was goes far beyond any hitherto reposed in a Minister under the Customs Act. same power over imports. ring to exports, and showing that it is possible under a clause, of this kind to bring about the most harmful results. The idiosyncrasies of a Minister may possibly assert themselves to a most injurious extent, and in view of the serious injury that may be done to the 'Commonwealth, some restriction or limitation should be imposed. Those remarks have special reference to paragraph b of proposed new section 112. I am in complete agreement with the remarks of the Minister with regard to the export of meat and other products with which he dealt. It has come under his notice, as it came under mine, that it is necessary to give the fullest power to follow products of that kind from the time and place of their manufacture or preparation to their actual exportation. Our export trade is likely to be seriously injured unless some power of inspection and rigid supervision is reposed in the Department. Such a power is being more and more exercised in other communities. We rely on them in many cases to accept our goods, and we have been notified that unless an official certificate of soundness, and purity, and freedom from disease accompanies the article, its importation into those countries will not be permitted. My honourable friend and myself know of various articles in regard to which appalling revelations have been made as the result of investigations which I originally caused to be made by the Department into conditions of manufacture and carriage from the place of preparation to the slings of the ships. Those conditions, if they had been allowed to continue and become known abroad, would have most alarmingly injured one of our most valuable tradesIt a trade which mav amount to something like £ 2 ,000,000 per annum.

Consequently, I .agree with my honourable friend that, in the interests of our export trade, it is essential that we should be in a position to certify to the purity and freedom from disease of our goods if they are to be received with confidence abroad. proud of our production. We are capable of producing articles of the very highest standard, and securing the highest prices abroad, and, therefore, we should have the fullest power to insure their purity. I admit that we have, in this connection, to fight against vested interests. We have the strongest vested interests to contend with as regards grading and other supervision of that character, and the Minister requires the fullest encouragement and strength of purpose in order to enable him to do justice to our productions. interests does the honourable member refer? ticularly in my mind, but I am not referring to butter. member was the cause of all the trouble with regard to butter. proposals to decrease the moisture in Australian butter, with a view to having its standard equal to the best on the London market. this Bill. dealt with. Power is taken in the Bill to control the export of butter, but it is specito impossible to put a stop to the smuggling fically controlled already by the Commerce Act. members that I shall do nothing with regard to butter outside the commerce regulations, which they will have a full opportunity of discussing. Butter is not dealt with in this Bill. most unfair to deal with it under these provisions, because by the commerce regulations we give the fullest notice to farmers and others as to the standards required and the degree of moisture beyond which they will not be permitted to go, and upon the faith of these the butter is prepared for export. I was only too anxious when in office to call conferences with a view to getting the soundest, advice, in order that the best results might be achieved in the butter trade. The Minister referred to the question of deposits of duty where there is any dispute or protest. The present law, as embodied in section 167 of the Act, is most unsatisfactory. It gives me satisfaction to remember that, owing to a recent case which was before the Court, where I deemed it necessary to take up a particular We are naturally attitude, thousands of pounds have been saved to the revenue of the Commonwealth. This clause is most concerned with refunds. I have at all times taken up the position that the merchant, having collected the duty already from his customers, should not be permitted to come upon the Consolidated Revenue for a refund. He may have already paid the money to the Customs, but, as a matter of fact, he has collected it from the public. With regard to outside packages, which were the subject of dispute during my term of office, a decision was given in favour of the Department, resulting in the saving of many thousands of pounds to the revenue. I admit that we have to do justice all round, and that when there is a fair and reasonable dispute regarding the payment of be prescribed. That means is provided by the Bill now before us. I go largely, if not completely, with the Minister as to the more rigid steps that are being taken to prevent smuggling. The country has determined that the importation of opium shall be prohibited. This step has been taken in the interests of public health and morals, and costs us something like ^60,000 a year in loss of revenue. Therefore, although it is next of opium, we must not be discouraged from making every effort, including the imposition of most rigorous penalties, to prevent it. The provision for limiting the size of the bags used for the conveyance of wheat and other produce, and the weight which may be put into them, is one which must have our support. Hitherto the humane object aimed at has been sought to be attained by the prohibition of the importation of jute and other bags of any but specified sizes, which has seriously interfered with one of our industries; but by empowering the Minister to prescribe the maximum or minimum weight or quantity of goods which may be contained in any one package, we shall attain our end much more easily, and prevent the heart-burning which we have had in the past.

Some of his officials in connection with a very important industry have shown the possession of an imperfect knowledge of the facts, and upon that imperfect knowledge have based a strong report upon which the Minister seems inclined to act. I , like the Minister, am very anxious that our Australian products should retain in the markets of the world the high position and reputation which they now occupy. I would point out, however, that the leading position which our butter exports occupy in the London market, as well as the markets of ether countries, has been secured without Government interference or help. The men who represent the industry have established a great export trade, and have placed it upon a magnificent footing. They manage the business from this end, and also have a committee of management in London, and they command in the markets of the world a price for their products which is very satisfactory to all connected with the industry. The development of the dairying industry saved Victoria a few years ago, and it is now adding millions to the wealth of Australia. All this has been done without Government interference. I am quite with the Minister and others in their anxiety to maintain the purity and soundness of the products that we export, and should not like anything to occur that would be calculated to diminish their high reputation. In that respect we cannot be too careful. At the same time. I disapprove of Government interference, with a view to fixing the values of our products by a system of grading. If certain proposals are carried out, we shall have an army of Government officials engaged in grading our products all over the Commonwealth. under the regulations which the Minister will no doubt issue, are to be allowed to grade our produce, so as practically to fix its value in the markets of the world, they will undertake a bigresponsibility, and the system, I feel confident, will be disastrous to the best interests of the dairying industry. The honourable member for Richmond and myself, who have both been closely connected with a certain industry, know that, while New Zealand has been pointed to as an example of success, grading is absolutely futile in the way of insuring any particular standard of price in . the markets of the world. Time after time, butter regarded here as second grade has obtained first class prices in London; but, if it is graded here as superfine, first class, 01 second class, that will practically fix the value of the product abroad with disastrous effects to the pockets of the farmers here. The honourable member for Richmond, the honourable member for Cowper, and myself, have all attended deputations to the Minister from those who are most largely interested in the butter industry; and, as I have said before, we were always received with all courtesy and afforded every opportunity of presenting our views. These deputations were representative of those who practically governed three-fourths of the butter trade, which, under a system of co-operation, has reached its . present eminence. I regard with a great deal of misgiving the issue of regulations by any Minister in the direction suggested. I have no desire to attack any Government official; but I cannot helpobserving that the report by Mr Lockyer, the 'Acting Comptroller of Customs, on which, I understand, the Minister proposes to act, was based on imperfect and inaccurate information. If this Bill be passed, there will always be a danger of industries being prejudiced by the reports of officials who are notconversant with the conditions. Who are the men most likely to be capable of judging as to what is best for the industry, not only in regard to its conduct in the Commonwealth, but in the markets of the .world ? Surely those who have made it a lifelong study, and who have raised it to its present high position in the face of great difficulty and prejudice abroad. I am certain that even the Minister does not claim any knowledge of this industry beyond what he has gleaned from the departmental officials, and various deputations that have waited upon him. This legislation affects the whole of the If these officials, people on the land in my district; and the same may be said in regard to the constituency of the honourable member for Richmond; and anything that prejudices the development of the butter industry must prove disastrous to the Commonwealth as a whole. Although the Bill has received the endorsement of the late Minister of Trade and Custome, I sincerely hope"" that the present Minister will not proclaim any regulations in connection with the grading of butter, because, as I have said, that will affect the value before the product leaves Australia, and prevent the producers obtaining the best prices. There is no objection,' of course, to insisting on the industry being carried out on the most up-to-date system; and all that is necessary in the way of cleanliness and so forth is insured in New South Wales, of which, of course, I can speak with greater knowledge. This great private enterprise has done much for my own State, Victoria, and several of the other States; and I am certain that if the industry be placed under Commonwealth supervision, we can only expect disaster. have very attentively followed this debate; and I realize that this is a Bill more for Committee discussion than for second reading speeches. We are indebted to the honourable member for Illawarra for his vigorous address, and to the honourable member for 'Richmond for his clear exposition; but I see that the measure affects far 'more than the butter industry, or the other industries which have been subject to careful scrutiny under the Commerce Act passed some time ago. The important clause is that which deals with prohibited exports; and the authorities certainly take very extensive powers, some of which, of course, may be necessary. I do not like to say, at this"" juncture, that the particular powers are as the proposed power to prohibit the extaken in a way that is advisable. The retaining in the Bill of the proposed amendments to section 112 would probably rejoice the soul of a bureaucrat; but I am not quite certain that it would be altogether safe to allow it to pass as drafted. I am told that Ministers are not altogether to blame for the ambitions and actions of their departmental heads. We have it on the authority of no less a person than the Minister of Home Affairs that Ministers are usually only ""animated rubber stamps""; and I suppose we may take it that the tremendous power under the clause referred to will be exercised by the departmental heads, and that the Ministers will be their humble instruments. This makes the position rather difficult, because the wording of the clause is very broad; for instance, it is provided that the Governor General, i.e. the Minister, may, by proclamation, prohibit the exportation of goods, the exportation of which will, "" in his opinion, be harmful to the Commonwealth."" We may get some "" animated rubber stamp "" who will take the view that the exportation of our best wheat would be "" harmful to the Commonwealth."" I have heard of statesmen in embryo-of collections of budding statesmen-meetin g together in solemn conclave, and denouncing the exportation of wheat as harmful to the country. drought, would it not be a good thing to prohibit exportation? any part of Australia, is the export of produce to be immediately prohibited ? If that is the meaning of the Bill, we ought not to pass it, because when occasion arises to take such stringent steps, the Parliament of the country should be consulted, and not merely the opinion of some departmental officials whom the people of Australia do not know. power whicli every Government possesses. abused in the way suggested by the honourable member, it is one which the Customs authorities should not possess. greater power than that over imports. ber of very stringent powers over imports, and those powers I have always resisted. I do not, however, think there is a power fraught with such far-reaching consequences portation of goods which, in the opinion of the Ministry of the day, would be "" harmful to the Commonwealth."" If it were said that the exportation of certain goods would be harmful to Austr.alia, inasmuch as being deleterious in quality, or for some other reason, they would prove a bad advertisement for our produce, then I would be entirely with the Bill, because I know the damage that has resulted-for instance, in the meat export trade-fro m this cause. a good thing if we had had tlie power to prohibit the exportation of a couple of cargoes of meat to the Philippines ? cellent, but those cargoes w'ould have been prohibited, because they were infected with pleuro.

At any rate, Senator Barker was not then in Parliament, and I was so busy watching the doings of much more important persons that I did not attempt to find out what particular persons were guilty of that lunacy. The fact remains that the Trades Hall Council did pass such a resolution, under the stupid idea that if the exportaMinister of the day given sufficient power tion of wheat were prohibited, the Australian farmers would still continue to grow as much as ever, and that the people of Australia would get it cheaper. not making an accurate statement. memory, it is accurate. has been raised in a certain case is whether the remark was made at a deputation.

Only half of it finds its market here now, and, therefore, in the opinion of the honourable member and of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council, the price of wheat in Australia will come down by half accordingly ! When we know that these various evidences of lunacy are abroad in our political life, and that views of this kind may shelter themselves behind a pair of the most eminently wise spectacles, and, unsuspected, evidence themselves when that pair of spectacles is sitting as an "" animated rubber stamp "" behind the protection of the permanent head of the Customs Department, we should pause beister. If we are not careful, the producing community of Australia, upon which the whole community lives, may find that they are to be denied their markets because certain persons happen to occupy a position of power in the Commonwealth, and tical economy. I shall vote for the Bill, in order to take it into Committee, but there its provisions will have to be most earnestly scrutinized in order to see that powers altogether beyond what are required are not vested in the Customs Department. I regard the measure in a. friendly light, and am anxious to see some of its provisions carried into effect, and the to prevent the exportation from Australia of diseased produce, which may be damaging to our export trade. The Bill, as the honourable member for Kooyong has pointed out, covers a very large area of valuable powers. Every opportunity should be given to the Commonwealth to see that our exports are properly supervised and placed on the markets of the world as productions which can be depended upon. The power proposed to be given over the exportation of goods is very far-reaching, and might easily be abused if any Minister undertook to exercise it to the full. In fact, such powers would be likely to be used much more detrimentally to the interests of the Commonwealth than if the Minister were given power to impose export duties on certain articles.

[225] I am not certain that the The Government has taken a two-handed grip of their concerns. It behoves us to jealously safeguard the reputation of our produce. Australia can produce the best wheat, the best butter, the best cheese, and the best of everything; but careless handling and marketing, and a negligent Government, might injure the good name of our productions in the markets of the W ill the honourable memworld. The Government must watch over those nefarious tricksters, the farmers of the farmers' produce, who do business in Sussex-street, Sydney, and in the other capitals. Unless we watch them carefully, and regulate their operations, the producers' interests will be greatly injured. Some years ago an industry was growing up in Australia which has reached enormous dimensions in America, because there the Government takes control until its products reach the markets of the world. It was JOHN FORREST -The Cabinet took thought that the great wealth in the Australian flora would be the source of"" an enormous trade in honey; but some very clever export gentlemen, the farmers of farmers' products, got to work on a shipment of Australian honey, and added to it a large quantity of eucalyptus oil, a substance which is practically a poison, and possesses an .abominable flavour. They placed the adulterated honey on the London market, thinking that it would have a special taste, which the consumers would like, but the effect was to do an injury to the industry from which it has never recovered. The Government should see that only the best goes from Australia, and should assist, by grading and branding, to establish a name for our products, and thus advance the interests of those whom the honourable member for Wentworth wishes conflicts regarding constitutional to alienate from us. this measure is before us, we are the masters of the situation; but when it has become law, the Minister will have immense powers vested in him, and it is of the utmost importance to the great exporting industries that their exercise shall be properly safeguarded.

The Government should have power to insure that Australian produce shall be what' it is reputed to be, and not a fraud and a sham, as some of it has been in the past. I am pleased to know that under this Bill the Minister of Trade and Customs will have power to control the sale of adulterated foodstuffs. I should vote for this Bill, no matter by what Government it was introduced, and my only regret is that it does not go even further. Under paragraph c of proposed new section 112 power is taken to enable the Governor General by proclamation to prohibit the exportation of any goodsthe prohibition of the exportation of which is, in his opinion, necessary ior the preservation of the flora or fauna of Australia. No one can say to-day what will be the result of the destruction of bird-life upon the insect pests of Australia. Wise men 'who have given much study to the diseases that decimate our crops and destroy our vintages and fruitages, have come to the conclusion, however, that the ruthless destruction of bird-life that has taken place may be the cause of the unwonted increase of these insect pests. This Bill will give the Minister power to control the export of birds, and will so render utterly useless the present destruction of birds of beautiful plumage. As to the power taken under this Bill to .regulate the size of packages, I was sorry to hear the honourable member for Wimmera pleading for delay, and yet more delay. The records of the surgeons of this city show that the hearts of many men have practically been broken by reason of the heavy weights that they have been called upon to carry. Is not the honourable member aware that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who gave his name to the Chapman bag, was a member of a Ministry which has been succeeded by three different Governments his action. honourable member's reference to a newspaper paragraph? is misconstruing my position. I am making ho objection at all in that connection. stood the honourable member. T thought that he complained that a mere notice, by means of a newspaper paragraph, of action on the part of the Minister was insufficient. ister to give notice, and reasonable breathing time, before he brought such a regulation into force. for delay, I do not know what is. Three Ministries have succeeded that of which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro was a member when he provided for a standard cornsack; and before and since then men of humane feelings have urged from many platforms that the workers should not be compelled to carry these large ancl heavy bags. Some of the old grain bags were capable of holding no less than 350 lbs. Samples were exhibited in this building, and not one honourable member was -strong enough to carry one a distance of 100 yards. There are on our wharfs men who have to carry these heavy weights up narrow planks and on board ship. Whilst they are on the wharfs their arms have full play, and the position is not so bad as it is in the hold of a vessel, where sometimes leverage has .to be used, and men strain their backs in carrying these heavy weights. If I had the power I would not allow any package to exceed 1 cwt. On the West Coast of America, I believe, that is the law to-day. The honourable member for Wimmera knows that bags capable of holding 5 cwt. can be made in this community, and yet he would ask for more delay in dealing with this question. No wonder his majority was reduced at the last general election if he advocated such a policy. vocated the continued use of the larger bags. Thomas Bent held office as Premier of this State he was pestered day after day by deputations asking him to fight against the action taken by the Commonwealth in regard to the use of a standard cornsack.

Neither the Minister nor any member who attended the deputation suggested in the slightest way that an export duly should \e imposed on wheat. This clause will not give that power to the Minister. The canard whicli has been sent throughout Australia that the' clause confers the power is absurd. Certainly the Minister could prevent the export of wheat, which was proved to be unfit for human consumption, or adulterated with seeds which would be dangerous to the community to which it -was to be exported. The other point which has been mentioned is too absurd to consider. I must compliment the Govermnent.

POST AND TELEGRAPH DEPARTMENTBAGS-PERSONA L EXPLANATION. Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [10.13] I move That the House do now adjourn. I desire to make a statement upon the policy of the Government in connection with the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department, .and particularly in relation to the Postal Commission's report. The Government has given very careful consideration to the recommendations of the Commission. Its report covers very considerable ground and deals very exhaustively with all matters connected with the administration and management of the Post Office. As many of the recommendations involve the expenditure of very much money and changes of a radical and almost fundamental character in the management of the Department, the Government have decided to consider these matters very carefully, at the earliest possible moment, with a view to give effect to such of them as it can approve. But in regard to some of the more important niatters it has arrived at a determination to which it also proposes to give effect at the earliest possible moment. Amongst these the position of the postal employees may be regarded as the most notable. The' Parliament has lately approved of a measure which will be submitted to tlie country in April next for ratification whereby it will be clothed with very much wider industrial powers, enabling it to deal with the rates of wages and conditions of labour of workmen, including State railway employees, throughout the Commonwealth. Under these circumstances, the Government consider it would be anomalous and illogical to deny to our own employees access to that tribunal which is open to all others. We think it advisable to make, all persons throughout the Commonwealth subject to the same tribunal, and, therefore, we propose, in respect to any disputes whicli may arise in connection with rates, and conditions in the Post and Telegraph Department, to clothe the Arbitration Court with sufficient power to determine such disputes. We intend at the earliest possible moment agree to such legislation as is necessary to enable the postal employees to refer their disputes to the Arbitration Court. ment the power to do that without the referenda ? ample constitutional power, but we cannot do it withqut legislation. At this stage of the sessionI hope that 1 am expressing the opinion of the House-it is inadvisable to attempt to introduce legislation of that character. quite follow the reference to the referenda in this connection. if the people approve them, have power through the Arbitration Court to determine, if necessary, the rates and conditions for all workmen in this country, we consider that that is the tribunal, and the only tribunal, which ought to settle disputes if any there be in connection with our own employees. I come now fo another matter. In regard to the employees in the lower grades of the Post and Telegraph Department we are of the opinion that something should be done to improve their conditions at an early date, and the Postmaster-General is now asking the",74,Foster Di D Senator Do Not Understand The Rudiments Of Poli

Below what salary ? ing the lower rates of salary. ber can supply his own instances. I come now to the question of the contract or semi official offices. The policy of the Government in regard to them is this: We consider it to be incompatible with our principles that there should be paid to persons in charge of those offices such salaries us are now paid. It is, therefore, the intention of the Government to pay in all cases a salary of not less than J^no to those in charge of semi-official offices. With regard to other matters dealt with in the Postal Commission's report, it is the intention of the Postmaster-General to convene a conference of the Deputy Postmasters-General of all the various States at a very early date, for the purpose of considering and giving effect to -such recommendations of the Postal Commission's report as permit of adjustment without legislation, and are of such a character as the Postmaster-General and his deputies can immediately agree upon. A word now upon a most important matter, namely, the developmental policy of the Department in the direction of further extending facilities to the country districts, and throughout Australia. The Government intend to push on vigorously with all works now in hand and for which money is available, realizing that it is their clear and unshould do more than skim the surface of mistakable duty to the people in the more remote districts that we should provide better and more effective facilities for comdiscovering its weaknesses, if there are munication, telegraphic and postal. It may be pointed out here that a larger sum of money has been placed upon the Estimates for such purposes this year; and that it is the intention of the Government to include in the next postal Estimates provision for two years, instead of for twelve months, thus obviating resort to the present practice whereby a vote unexpended after the year for which it was voted becomes incapable of utilization. Lastly, we propose to amend the Public Service Act next session, giving greater power in the direction indicated; and wherever, in carrying out any or all of the recommendations of the Postal Commission, the Government, during the recess, come to an agreement, they will submit proposed legislation to Parliament at the earliest possible moment next session. have listened with some degree of pleasure, and with some curiosity, to the statement that has been made by the Acting Prime Minister. WhilstI have no reason to complain as to the manner in which the Government are at least using the Postal Commission's report as a guide to the initiation of reforms which they have discovered to be necessary in the Department-as , for instance, with respect to the recommendation to increase the remuneration of those in charge of non-official offices to £110 a year, and also with regard to the recommendation as to the lower-grade officers of the serviceI may also indicate that there are ether recommendations, permeating the whole report, which it Ts necessary to carry out, in order that fair treatment may be secured to the officers. member tell us what is meant by "" lowergrade officers "" ? honourable member what the Acting Prime Minister means by the term, but I can tell him what I mean by it.

It is not my intention to enter on this question at length.

It recommends the appointment of a body ot men who understand die ramifications of the service, and who have a thorough grip of the questions upon which they will have to adjudicate. The Acting Prime Minister has merely dealt with the report from a superficial stand-point. He has not said whether the Government intend to deal with the king pin of that document, namely, the re-organization of the management of the Department. judgment, unless its management be thoroughly re-organized, all that may be done in a piecemeal fashion will result only in the breeding of further discontent in the service. The Commission hold that certain structural alterations' are absolutelynitely I should have told the honourable necessary if the Department is properly to discharge its functions. I know that the Acting Prime Minister has not had sufficient time to thoroughly examine the report of the Commission. But I can assure him that that report is not of a piecemeal character, and that all its recommendations are dovetailed one into the other. I ask the honourable gentleman to do the Commission the justice of looking into that report from the aspect which I have presented, during the recess. If we are going to reform this Department, let it be reformed in a way which vvill do credit to the Government and the Commonwealth. The mere extension of postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities in country districts is entirely dependent upon thefinancingof the Department. The changes recommended by the Commission will involve an expenditure of money. Seeing that the Department has been managed in such a way as to bring about the condition of affairs which exists to-day, ought we to trust that management with the solution of the great problems which confront it to-day? I repeat that the Commission's report must be dealt with from a comprehensive stand-point. I do not propose to detain honourable members; but when the Estimates are under consideration, I will endeavour to deal with this question more exhaustively. If there be one subject which should merit their attention, it is that of the administration of this great Department, upon which we are annually expending nearly £4,000,000. partment needs to be reformed, lock, stock, for further report?

From what I have heard from the Attorney-General, it seems that he proposes to set us another Court. There has been an inquiry at the cost of ,£4,000 or £5,000, and every rank and grade of the service has been investigated, and their work valuated and assessed; but we are now told that all that must go for nothing, and the men must be sent on to the Arbitration Court for another inquiry. sort. member said the Government proposed to create by law an Arbitration Court which would settle the remuneration of the lower grades. that involved no re-adjustment of existing conditions.

I do not think anybody would expect more. quarrel with the honourable gentleman; I am trying to understandwhat he did mean; and it seems to me he has not made the mattei very clear. I do not know where the Arbitration Court is to begin, and how far it is to modify the report of the Commission. Certain recommendations have been made which have nothing to do with the Public Service Commissioner, and, therefore, need not, unless the Government feel so disposed, be referred to him. If they be so referred, that can mean nothing but an appeal from the Commission which has just dissolved. Commissioner subject to the law is final'; and what we propose to substitute is an Arbitration Court to enable the Commonwealth employees to appeal from the Commissoner's decision. Until the law is amended that cannot be done. clear so far, but have the Government made up their minds about the report of the Pcstal Commission? much as I propose to say; and I think I have said sufficient. know what the honourable gentleman has said; [10.47] I am glad the Attorney-General has made a statement as to the intentions of the Government in respect to this report, which has excited a good deal of interest both inside ancl outside the service. We in Parliament know that the Government cannot deal all at once with the far-reaching recommendations in the report; and the Minister has indicated what is proposed to be done immediately, what it is proposed to hold over for consideration in recess, and what is to be dealt with next session. I am glad that the Government propose to at once do something for the lower grades. There is some difficulty, so far as legisla' tion is concerned, inasmuch as legislation prescribes the salaries, and the Public Service Commissioner cannot make or recommend increases. I understand, however, that the Government propose to give those increases by asking for a special vote to cover the expenditure. The probabilities are that the difficulties which the Public Service Commissioner and the Government experience in this connection will be remedied by legislation in the near future. which the Government propose to go immediately in this direction will be more definitely stated by the Postmaster-General on the Estimates. of the Postal Commission shows that a large number of the public servants in the Department are doing substantial work for a remuneration which does not represent what may be termed a living wage;' and the Government propose to ask for a vote to enable those wages to be increased. involved in an expenditure amounting to £23,000 in bringing the wage up to £110. the Government also propose to deal with those who may be considered outside the regular service, particularly those who do what is known as semi-official postal work. Under the present regulations, an official post-office must have a minimum income of £400 a year, and a semi-official office an income of, at least,. £200 a year. The semi-official offices include all offices in which the income earned ranges from .£200 to .£400 a year.

595,Mr Thomas Brown,"I am gladsemi-official offices were regarded as official, and were under the control of Government officials. When their status was reduced to that of semi-official offices, the Government officers in charge were transferred elsewhere, and private persons were given control of them. In this way the action of the Government created an army of persons outside the service the whole of whose time is taken up in the work of the Department, though they have not the status of officers of the Department. By raising the salaries of the persons in charge of these semi-official offices to the minimum of £110, they may again be dealt with as officers of the Department, and, without reflecting in any way upon the present management of the semi-official offices, I have no doubt that the action recently taken will result in greater satisfaction to die public. WhilstI think it is wise that the Department should continue the present semi-official offices, the Government should, in the future, consider the advisableness of bringing them more largely under the control of the Department by appointing recognised Government officials in charge of them. This might be done by reducing the minimum annual incoine required for an official office. I hope that something will be done in that direction, and that these offices will be restored to the status they held in New South Wales prior to Federation and until a little while ago, when the change to which I have referred very naturally caused a great deal of friction and dissatisfaction. [10.53] -There is a matter which I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister, and I take advantage of this opportunity to do-so. Complaints have been made to me that the sorting staff in the General Post Office in Sydney, when required to work overtime, are given no allowance for tea-money, though such an allowance is made to members of the clerical staff working overtime. that that should be abolished. formation is that members of the clerical staff working overtime receive tea-money, and members of the sorting staff in similar circumstances do not. I do not take any responsibility for this statement, but that is the information conveyed to me. the Minister when he gave instructions that that, at the present time, in certain stacks they should receive tea-money. [226] pears that tbey are not receiving tea-money. They have had to work on until 8 o'clock at night, and, though they are allowed twenty minutes off, between 4.40 and 5 p.m., that does not give them sufficient time to go to their homes or anywhere, except in the immediate neighbourhood of the Post Office, to get their tea. As they are put to expense in providing their tea, it is only reasonable that the Department should give these men an allowance to cover that expense. In view of the fact that the Christmas season is approaching, when, owing to the increased volume of business, overtime will bave to be worked to a greater extent than at present, I trust that the Minister will give instructions that, these men shall receive the tea-money to which they are justly entitled. In the course of tbe debate this evening upon the Customs Bill, the honourable member for Wentworth made a statement concerning me which I had not an opportunity to contradict. I understand that he stated that I had advocated from the public platform an export tax on wheat. That is an utter untruth. I never, to my knowledge, advocated such a thing. I do not doubt that the honourable member may have read in some newspaper a statement that I had done so, but if I had seen such a statement published I sbould have taken steps to contradict it. I take advantage of this opportunity to do so now. During the evening, in making reference to the power of the Minister to prohibit the export of wheat in bags above a certain size, I stated that, representing, as I do, what, I believe, is the largest wheat-growing constituency in Australia, that the decision of a previous Minister of Trade and Customs to reduce the size of the bags bad met with general approval, though the wheat-growers would have preferred, instead of a bag holding 186 lbs., a bag holding 200 lbs., as promised by the Minister. I also stated to the Minister that I hoped that, if he intended to put a regulation into force prohibiting the exportation of wheat in bags other than the size stated, be would give the farmers reasonable notice of his intention.

The honourable member for Melbourne, in commenting later upon whnt I said-as it appeared to me, for political purposes-mad e some reference to my connection with the matter. I make this explanation in order to make it clear to the honourable member that he misconstrued my remarks in the first place. No association or body, in my opinion, has ever advocated the use of very large sacks, or would at the present time countenance their use for any purpose. I am very glad to receive the assurance of the honourable member for Wimmera, but I must still say that I consider that, by his action, he seems to seek delay. As I pointed out to him, four Ministers able member will not be in order in referring to a previous debate. explanation, and I am sure the honourable member for Wimmera will accept my assurance, to say that 1 had no desire to misrepresent him in thought or deed. What1 stated was that there were continual deputations to Sir Thomas Bent, asking him to bring pressure to prevent Mr Chapman, the then Minister of Trade and Customs, fixing 200 lbs. as the maximum size of cornsacks. Those representations were followed up by every association that I am aware of connected with the wheat industry of Victoria. [11.0] 1 wish totell the Acting Prime Minister that I shall expect upon the Estimates some statement in regard to the congestion of the construction branch of the Post and Telegraph Department, especially with regard to telephone lines. 1 am heartily sick of receiving from the Department a notice stating that, although such-and-such a work has been agreed to, it cannot be proceeded with at once, on account of so many other works of a similar character having also to be constructed. That sort of congestion should not exist; and I trust the Government will tell the House how they intend to remove it. Question resolved in the affirmative.
