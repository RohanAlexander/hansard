Labour and National Service whether the colliery of Australian Iron and Steel Limited at Bulli has been idle since the 23rd September on account of a claim by the men that, for health reasons, a different system of working should be instituted? Have the men stated their preparedness to give, in the presence of the Minister for Mines in New South Wales, and other representative persons, a demonstration in order to prove that dust conditions are abnormal in the mine? Is there a tendency to the contraction of pneumonoconiosis by miners? Have many of the miners in the district died from that complaint, and are many others to-day receiving compensation on its account? Can the Minister state what action he proposes to take in order that the men may resume work, and give a demonstration in the presence of persons who are capable of making an adjudication in regard to the conditions? facts are as stated. I propose to take the matter up with the Minister for Mines-in New South Wales, with a view to a test being made at an early date in order that a settlement of the dispute may be effected as soon as possible.

3,Mr Ward,"I understand that theM t , BYAN Canberra is an inland city of no strategic importance, that the Japanese fleet recently suffered heavy casualties in respect of its aircraft carriers, and that a distinguished member of this House last night met with a severe acident, will the Prime Minister use his persuasive powers with the Minister for the Interior with a view to the modification of the ridiculous system of black-out or brownout that operates in this city? offer any reply to that part of the honourable gentleman's question in which he has described the strategic importance of Canberra as he views it . That is a matter upon which more competent authorities than I may take whatever action they may deem proper. This is the capital city of Australia, and it is very important that there shall not be any external cause for the dislocation of its routine. I deeply regret that any member of this Parliament should have suffered a mishap from any cause. In regard to the brown-out, I have asked the Department of Home Security, whose judgment in the matter is formed for it by the Chiefs of Staff, to report to me what is the precise advice of the military authorities. When I receive that, whatever it may be, it shall be given effect. Security, in reply to a question some time ago, indicated that a review of the blackout conditions had beenmade recently at the request of the State Premiers, and that, as they had made no further request, no further review had been made. Does the Prime Minister consider it -appropriate that a review' of those blackout conditions should be made only at die request of the State Premiers, and that a lead should not be given by the Commonwealth? Isi t appropriate that the black-out conditions should operate in the same degree in all capital cities, regardless of the degree of risk? operate to the same degree i u all cities. The degree was varied as the result of recommendations made by the chiefs of staff. Mr HO . LT It is blacker in Melbourne than it is anywhere else. In view of the fact thai able member's question. member said that it was blacker in Melbourne than anywhere else. I am giving to him the answers that I know have been given by the department and the chiefs of staff. It is incorrect that the State Premiers alone ask for the review. Review occurs regularly, and is usually made after a general appreciation of the strategical position has been made by the combined chiefs of staff. A review of the I do not propose to general strategic position of Australia and this part of the world is Hearing completion, and, when I receive the report, I shall ask for a specific review of the black-out arrangements. ABSENTEEISM IN MUNITIONS Munitions take action to prevent the continuance of absenteeism in munitions establishments, by either the appointment of a judicial commissioner or the establishment of a court on a basis parallel to the British system, which deals with absenteeism by the imposition of fines and other punishments?

Immediately it is received, I shall confer with the Minister for Labour and National Service as to what are the best means of checking the unfortunate condition of absenteeism in our munitions establishments.

This talk was to he civen by Professor Woodruff, under the title of "" This Liquor Tyranny "". The proposed talk was reported as being a strongly worded anti-liquor talk. The Melbourne office was instructed not to take Professor Woodruff's talk. The grounds for this instruction are(1) The subject of the use of alcohol and governmental control of the liquor trade is a highly controversial social and political one. (2) The commission does not evade the broadcasting of controversial subjects, hut its policy is that the conflicting viewpoints, and not merely one viewpoint, should be. broadcast.

I have received from the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The proposed plan and actions of the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) with regard to the rationalization of the Australian woolgrowing industry, and the necessity for the .appointment of a representative advisory committee "". I move That the House do now adjourn. ported ? Five honourable -members having risen in support of the motion, so do members of the grazing industry throughout Australia, that probably no other Minister has a more difficult task than the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman). His department is entirely new and has many problems to overcome. Therefore, my criticism will be constructive and designed to assist the Minister and prevent him from repeating mistakes which he has made in the past. The graziers are prepared to accept rationalization of their industry, if necessary, but tember, nearly four months after the they believe that the courtesy which has been given to almost every other industry in Australia should also be extended to them. Their organizations should have been consulted by the department when it was preparing plans for rationalization. This issue is of considerable importance. The industries concerned are major primary industries, and I , as a representative of a rural constituency, have a duty to bring this maitter before the would the Government take other action. Parliament and the people. In order to show how the wool-growing industry has developed, I refer to the fact that there were 73,061,000 sheep in Australia in IS99, and 121,363,000 in 1940. The gross value of the wool produced in 1S99 was £13,500,000, from S07,031 bales, and tbe gross value in 1940-41 was £60,937,000, from 3,500,000 bales. Any proposals to rationalize this important industry must be submitted to the closest examination. Cn a statement to bhe House on the 29th April last with regard to the Department of War Organization of Industry, the Minister said that at the special request of the Central Wool Committee and the Australian Meat Board it was intended to evolve rationalization plans for the pastoral industry in all its aspects, right, to the killing and processing of meat and the transport of wool to the spinning factory or the docks. I draw attention to the functions of the Central Wool Committee. It was established to appraise the Australian wool clip and to make arrangements for its storage, handling and shipment on behalf of the British Government which ha-d purchased the clip. It is not concerned in any way with the production of wool. It is purely a marketing body, and is composed of a Supreme Court judge, an executive officer, three representatives of wool growers., three representatives of brokers, a representative of wool-buyers and a representative of the manufacturers. which the honourable member supported established it. to the committee; but I say that its activities should be confined to the work for which it was established. It should not be expected to solve all the problems of the wool industry. On the 3rd SepMinister had made the statement to which I referred, the press published an announcement by the Minister to the effect that the Government had adopted far-reaching proposals to rationalize the wool industry. These included measures to conserve labour and transport, and also proposals that growers should voluntarily reduce their flocks.

79,Mr Abbott,"I make no objectionAccording to the Sydney Morning Herald of the 3rd September, the Minister used these wordsOnly in the event of voluntary co-operation failing would the Government contemplate other measures to achieve these objecby the department without first collatives. The industry at once saw a grave threat in this announcement, which came as a complete surprise, because the Minister bad more than once made it clear that, when rationalization of any industry was proposed, both employers and employees would he consulted. There had been no consultation organizations. months officers of the Minister's department had been planning the future of two great industries without even consulting representatives of the organizations in those industries. strangely with the treatment accorded to trade unions. I have often heard Ministers state in this House that various gentlemen who are connected with the trade unions must be consulted in these matters. That courtesy should have been extended to the wool-growing industry. According to the newspapers of the Sth September, the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) saidAny interests which can tell the Government how to do better than the rationalization their flocks, or to send sufficient sheep to scheme proposed are invited to put forward suggestions, which will receive the fullest consideration. This was a very belated invitation, and I believe that it was made in an endeavour to "" save i'ac-e "" for the Minister for tember. I quote the following paragraph War Organization of Industry. It is too late to invite people to be present at an execution when the victim's head has already fallen into the basket. Minister for War Organization of industry led the people to believe that plated holding di=cns«ions with the wool-growers' representatives when he acknowledged the offer of assistance. He said that the offer would be accepted in good time. Put his excuse was very weak, because he did not wait for those discussions to take place before he announced the rationalization scheme. Both the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Padden) and I criticized the Minister for failin g to consult the organizations concerned. I pointed out, in a statement to the press, that in June the Wool-growers Council had adopted a resolution asking that no decision on rationalization of the wool-growing industry should be made borating with the elected representatives of the growers' organizations. The terms of this resolution were conveyed by letter to the Prime Minister on the 10th July. The council assured the Prime Minister that it desired to assist the Government with its proposals. The Prime Minister acknowledged the letter with the wool-growers' stating that the council's offer was appreApparently, for four ciated, and that a further communication would be sent to it on the subject as soon as possible. No further communication was received by the council. Its next information was obtained on the 3rd SepThis contrasts tember from statements published in the press throughout Australia. Yet, the whole subject was of vital importance to the pastoral industry. Following criticism by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) and myself, the Ministeif o r War Organization of Industry sought to extricate himself from the muddle by declaring that no action would be taken to implement the decision to induce wool-growers voluntarily to stabilize or reduce the size of slaughter to meet all requirements, without a f u l l discussion with the representatives of the industry. Another surprising feature of the whole business was revealed in press reports on the 4th Sepf r o m an article headed "" Ministers .Deny Responsibility"", which was published under the date, Canberra, 3rd SepThe tember, in the Adelaide Advertiser, on the 4th September:Protests by representatives of the grazing the Prime Minister contemindustry at the circumstances in which a plan for the rationalization of the industry was developed have led to an extraordinary lack of willingness on the part of members of the Government to take any responsibility for the plan. The Minister for War Organization of Industry, whose department is nominally responsible for the plan, declined to comment. He said that the matter was the responsibility of the Minister for Commerce( Mr Scully). Mr Scully, while admitting that the grazing industry had not been consulted on the rationalization plan, said that his department was not responsible as the matter was comman's Department and the Commerce Department had no responsibility. Mr Scully added that, while not taking responsibility, he did not think that failure to consult the grazing industry was important, as the rationalization plans much more closely concerned the Central Wool Committee than individual graziers. We do not agree with that statement. I ment by the Minister for War Organization invite honourable members to consider the of Industry that graziers would be well adamazing spectacle of two members of the vised to keep clown the numbers of their Ministry each disclaiming responsibility flocks. for a published plan to rationalize a vitally important industry. Such a state made available was urgent to meet the heavy of affairs is a sad commentary on requirements of the services. Commonwealth administration. In an endeavour to get to the bottom of the business, certain questions were asked in this House. Obviously, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out at the time, this was a case of "" passing the buck"". The Minister for War Organization of Industry said that he did not believe the statement attributed to his colleague, the Minister for Commerce( Mr Scully), whilst that honourable gentleman said that he had been incorrectly reported. "" Incorrectly reported"" seems to be a contagious disease which has spread from one Minister to another since the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Ward) contracted it some time ago. I sincerely hope that the contagion does not spread to the members of the Opposition. Neither Minister volunteered to give to the House his version of the interview, details of which were published in the press in Brisbane and Adelaide. I suggest that behind the whole matter there is a certa.in amount of resentment by the Minister for Commerce because his views on the rationalization plan had been ignored. It would seem that the proposed press announcement concerning the plan was submitted to the Minister for Commerce for his approval, and that he suggested certain alterations; yet the nest thing he knew was that the statement in its original form had been published in the press. The honourable gentleman appears to have been both surprised and annoyed. ing provides a disagreement between the two Ministers. The Minister for War Organization of Industry to a press report on the 3rd September, Mr Abbott. that every effort would be made to induce graziers voluntarily to reduce the size of their flocks. A week later, the Minister for Commerce stated that the Government would not compel graziers to reduce their flocks. The honourable gentleman also saidThe belief that the Government intended to use compulsion probably arose from a stateThe need for great numbers of sheep being It is deplorable that a statement by a Minister one week should be contradicted by another Minister the next week. No wonder widespread confusion existed concerning what the Government's intentions really were. It appears that the Minister for War Organization of Industry-whos e knowledge of the pastoral industry is, I suggest, exceedingly limited -and his academic advisers were greatly concerned about the increase of the number of sheep in Australia in recent years) but if be and his officers had had any experience of the industry they would have known that the increase was due to several factors, each of which had resulted from the labours of those engaged in the industry. Rather than seek the advice of men who were in a position to speak with authority, the department was content to blunder along framing a scheme which to-day provides striking evidence of the ignorance of those who framed it. There is a further serious aspect of the subject. When the Minister for War Organization of Industry was challenged in the House, he gave misleading information. Subsequently the honourable gentleman was forced to admit that some of his statements were inaccurate. Why did he not make sure of his facts before explaining his actions to Parliament so positively? When I questioned him concerning the committee or persons who had been specifically requested to report on the rationalization of the industry, the This happenhonorable gentleman replied that Proconcrete evidence of fessor Clunies Ross and Mr D.

The Minister has since been obliged Chippendale, of the Department of War to correct that statement. In a letter Organization of Industry, dated the 4th which he wrote to me on the 16th May, 1942, which readSeptember, he stated that he should have said that ""members"" of those bodies of the 1st May, addressed to the Chairman of had been consulted as he had discovered the Central Wool Committee, advising arrangethat although discussion took place with ments made by your department for a comseveral members of the bodies referred to, prehensive investigation of the' wool industry. an official approach was not made to the vices bodies. Later, I wrote to the Minister the Faculty of Veterinary Science, University and also asked him in this House to of Sydney, as Adviser, and of D. A. Gill, direcfurnish the names of the representatives tory, who were consulted by Professor Clunies Ross and Mr Gill. His replies were assist in every possible way, and w ill at an curious. In his letter to me the Minister early date suggest the names of persons suitsaidAlthough discussions took place with several members of the bodies mentioned, as they were apparently not consulted officially as representatives of the particular body, but as persons with expert knowledge of wool industry problems, there may be some embarrassment to the individuals if specific details of the discussions were made public. The honourable gentleman was not asked for specific details of the discussion; he was asked for the names of the people who were said to be the representatives of the industry; and he has had to admit that they were not the official representatives: His letter stated on this pointI f you so desire it , however, I have no objection to having you informed personally of the position, and I feel sure that you would recognize that, having in mind the object of the discussion, tlie measures taken were adequate to secure necessary information, although it might have been preferable in the circumstances also to have approached the parties concerned officially.

On the 9th A p r i l , a very similar request emanated from a conference with the Australian Meat Board. In his reply to me, the Minister kindly read an extract from a letter that I have included a copy of a letter from Mr received from a British agent stationed N"". W. Yeo, an executive member of the on the north coast of Africa. This shows I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter It is noted that you have obtained the serof Professor Ian Clunies Ross, Dean of tor of the McMaster Animal Health LaboraSydney, as executive officer. The Central Wool Committee is anxious to able to act in an advisory capacity. I have an appointment for a discussion with Mr Gill to-morrow, the 5th instant. I suggest that that letter indicates clearly .that the approach was made by the Department of War Organization of Industry and not by the Central Wool Committee. If the Minister still persists in his statement that the approach was made by the Central Wool Committee, I ask him to make available the minutes of the meeting of the Central Wool Committee, which requested that an approach be made. In order to ascertain the origin of the proposal for a curtailment of the wool clip, I asked the Attorney^General (Dr. Evatt) in this House some time ago whether, in his discussions with the British Government, concerning an increase of the price of wool, there was any suggestion that steps should be taken to curtained at the present level. Eveni f wool of a shortage of wool such as the world has never previously experienced. [Extension of time granted.] I shall the. dearth of wool in Europe at present.

That shows the acute shortage of wool in Germany and other countries of Europe, which are in the bonds of Germany but are friendly to the United Nations. Any proposal to curtail wool production in Australia would be foolhardy. It would cut across the Atlantic Charter and would be un-Christianlike, as many people in Europe are shivering with cold because they have not sufficient wool. I do not underestimate the ability of Professor 'Olunies Ross and Mr Gill in their particular spheres of activity. Dr. Ross is an old friend of mine. He and Mr Gill are both eminent men in their own professions, but as you. Mr Speaker, know, and as the Minister for War Organization of Industry will appreciate, if a large number of wethers were depastured on a paddock that grew only lucerne, the high, proteiu content of that food would make them sick and they would not grow fat. I contend that the protein content of the brains of Professor Clunies Ross and Mr Gill is so high that, although they hold the most distinguished degrees, they have not matriculated experience. I suggest that a good blend would be obtained if they were associated with men of practical experience in the industry. The Australian Wool-growers Council and the Federal Council of the Graziers Association should be consulted in this matter. I am a. member of those great unions. growers Council has a membership of about 16,000 graziers, whilst the Australian Wool Federation represents about Mr Abbott. 1S,000 members, who together own S0,000,000 sheep, or three-fourths of the whole of the flocks in Australia. It is imperative that immediate action be taken to consult those who are in a position to give the best advice to the Commonwealth Government with regard to this important industry. I suggest to the appointed consisting of Professor Clunies Ross, Mr Gill, two representatives of the wool-growers' organizations and one representative of the Australian Workers Union. Such a. committee could advise the Minister regarding the proposed rationalization of the wool industry. War Organization of Industry) [3.36] Some time ago the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) read to this House a most interesting communication which showed clearly that the Opposition had undertaken to make a concerted attack on certain government departments, and the Department of War Organization of Industry was specifically mentioned in that document. The attack is running true to form. I am confirmed in that opinion by the lack of courtesy which has been shown to ine in that I was not informed until 1.15 p.m. to-day that this motion for the adjournment of the House was to be made. I understand that it is customary for the Government to be given notice of such a motion. In endeavouring to dig up something on which to attack my department, the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) has found a. "" mare's nest "". There are no proposals in hand for the rationalization of the wool-producing industry.

All of the persons attending the conference agreed that Professor Clunies Ross, who for three years had been the Australian representative on, and chairman of, the International Wool Secretariat, was admirably fitted lo take charge of the investigation. 1 understand also that the Wool Board, of which the honourable member for New England is a member, specifically sent Professor Clunies Ross to England to undertake an investigation on its behalf extending over a period of two years. On the 4th May, the executive member of the Central Wool Committee wrote to ray department expressing the desire of the committee to assist in every possible way, and stating that at an eariy date it would suggest the names of members who would act as consultants. No further advice on this point was received by me. Not unnaturally, I assumed that the members of tbe Central Wool Committee, with whom discussions were held subsequently were in fact the consultants referred to in the letter of the o;et anything done. executive member. '.Chat is the history of the genesis of this investigation. It will be noted that consultations on a considerable scale have taken place with the members of the Central Wool Committee. The honourable member for New England( Mr groups 1, 2 and 3 are among the preAbbott) has given the composition of that committee. It consists of a chairman, three wool-growers, three wool-selling brokers, an individual who will be actively engaged in the business of woolhuying, and a manufacturer. Four interests are represented, and they are designated a, b. c and d in the regulations. All of those interests were consulted by Professor Clunies Ross. gentleman denied that in his letter. thing. I said that all of those interests had been consulted. If one considers the various interests, one will note that they are the interests whom the honourable member for New England has said I should consult directly. When I want to inquire into an industry, and there is a body representative of all the interests in it, am I expected to go beyond that representative body and to consult each of the sectional interests represented thereon? Is it expected that I shall go beyond the Central Wool Committee and consult the Australian Wool-growers Council, which, I presume, is represented on the Central Wool Committee? Is it expected that I shall go to the Graziers Federal Council? Andi f I do, is it expected that I shall go beyond that council to each State council? Is it expected that I shall go from the Central Wool Committee to the National Council of Wool-selling Brokers, and then to each individual broker who participates in the election of representatives to that council? Just how far back is it expected that I am to go with the discussions in regard to any industry? When I have had consultations with the body that is representative of all interests, is not that ail that can be expected of me? If I were to undertake discussions on that plane-if I were to go back and consult all the sectional interests in any industry-m y department would never Let me deal with the need for rationalization in the handling of wool. An analysis of the personnel engaged in appraising, cleaning, shipping and storage indicates that quite a number of men of military age could be released. For example, 38 men in the military age liminary appraisers in the several States. They have been refused permission to enlist, even though the man-power officers have said that they ought to be given permission. They are not appraisers who need to have a great degree of skill. In Queensland, New* South Wales and Victoria combined, out of 523 men employed in reclassing and repacking, 175 are between the ages of 18 and 35 inclusive. In the scouring and carbonizing section, of 1,034 hands in New South Wales, 333 are of military age; and in Victoria, of 430 hands. .166 are of military age. The figures for all the State? definitely show that an inquiry into the handling of wool was needed, in order to make sure that labour was not lurking there which could be better used in some other direction in the war effort. It was in the light of these facts that Professor Clunies Ross made certain recommendations to my department. When",23,Rationalization Of Wool Industry Format Motion For Adjournment

85,Mr Dedman,"I denied no suchthose recommendations came before me, I consulted with the Minister for Commerce( Mr Scully); and the proposals were eventually placed' 'before the Production Executive of Cabinet and were approved by it. The bulk of the decisions of the Production Executive are of such a character that they are to be implemented by the Central Wool Committee itself-the committee that is representative of all the interests which the honourable member for New England has complained have never been consulted. Consequently, tbe very men whom the honourable member says would know whether or not the decisions are wrong or cannot be given effect because of their impracticability, will have a voice in their implementation. It was decided that the Central Wool Committee should be instructed to draw up, in consultation with the Director General of Land Transport, a scheme which will give priority of transport to wool of the type that can be passed most expeditiously through appraisal centres to shipment or storage. What is wrong with that? If there be anything wrong with it, will not the representative of the woolI n the statement which I submitted to growers on the Central Wool Committee have a voice in the matter ? The Central Wool Committee is to be asked to extend wool appraisement throughout the year, and to hold smaller and more frequent appraisements. What is wrong with that ? If there be anything wrong with it, the representative of the wool-growers on the Central Wool Committee will be able to express an opinion concerning it.

In the statement which I handed to the press there was only one reference to the numbers of sheep, and that was only an oblique reference. of the statement which I handed to the press. My remarks relate to it, and not to anything published in the press. The honourable member for New England said something about misreporting being an infectious disease. I say that it has become an epidemic since I took office. the press the only reference to the numbers of sheep was to the effect that we required sufficient mutton to reach the market to meet the requirements of the civil population and the armed services, and that we hoped that the growers would co-operate by sending that mutton forward. I added that if they did not cooperate, we would have to consider taking other steps. I adhere to that statement. When the matter was raised in this House by the honourable member for New England, I promised that I would consult further with the different organizations concerned. Accordingly, on the 19th September, I wrote to the Central Wool Committee, the Australian Wool-growers Council, the National Council of Woolselling Brokers, the Australian Wool Producers Federation, and the Associated Woollen and Worsted Manufacturers of Australia in the following terms:Following the announcement of certain measures which have been adopted by the Government as a means of rationalizing the wool industry, I promised in Parliament recently that before the regulations were drafted to give effect to the proposals, I would give consideration to any further representations",24,Rationalization Of Wool Industry Format Motion For Adjournment

Such committee should be composed of men competent to say what is best for the wool industry, and whose advice and assistance could be regarded as being in the interests of the wool-growers and of the nation. I was astonished at the statement of the Ministerf o r ""War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) that there was no intention on the part of the Government to rationalize wool. If that be so, there has been considerable misunderstanding regarding the statement made early in September, which led to a controversy in the newspapers, and numerous protests by various organizations associated with the wool industry. Those protests came from numerous centres, and included one by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson). In the Adelaide Advertiser of the Sth September, the honourable gentleman is reported as follows:Mr Wilson, M.H.R., said that he was not in favour of the Government's proposals for rationalization of the wool industry. Any suggestion to reduce -flocks was sheer folly. He would oppose any unnecessary interference with this great national asset. There must have been something to cause such statements to be made. There appears to be some attempt to ""pass the buck"". demic of misrepresentation to which I have referred.

Those who administer the scheme were previously buyers for foreign firms. They were appointed as controllers of the wool appraisement scheme. suppose the representatives of the wool growers agreed to their appointment. The system of wool appraisement worked satisfactorily during the last war, and the growers thought, no doubt, that it would work satisfactorily again. The trouble is, however, that some of the men appointed to act as appraisers have retained their association with foreign wool-buying firms. If they are not actual blood relations of the heads of those firms, they are related to them by marriage. They may be very good woolappraisers , but there is always the sug1 gestion that they may be working in the interests of the firms with which they were previously associated. There are in Australia men who used to conduct their own wool stores, men with a wonderful instinctive knowledge of wool, and such men would be quite well able to appraise under the wool-purchase scheme. Knowledge such as they possess cannot be acquired; a man is born with it, just as others are born with an instinctive knowledge of stock. I have known men who, by merely looking at a yearling colt or calf, could say with some degree of certainty into what kind of a sire it would It was a pleasure to listen to him. He develop. Such knowledge cannot be passed on, and when a man dies, it dies with him. ment. However, I am afraid that his Under the old system of wool auctions, various growers might have their wool classed by competent men so that when it reached the sale floor they were complimented by their brokers on its condition. Then, a man who possessed that instinctive knowledge of wool to which I have referred, would come along and buy a parcel of wool from each of those clips, take them to his own wool store, reclassify them, and make money out of selling the wool again. Such men have been deliberately overlooked under the wool-appraisement scheme, because they would be able to see how the scheme is being handled in the interests of overseas firms. I made representations to the Prime Minister on this subject, and he promised to have an investigation made. He has just informed me that he has received a report on the subject, which he will allow me to read, and I shall do so with great pleasure. There are wool-growers in Australia who bave been breeding sheep along well-established blood lines for a great many years, and they were always able to get more than the average price for their wool under the auction system. They expected that, under the appraisement system, they would still receive more than the average price. [Extension of time granted.} Instead, however, of receiving 2d. or 2-Jd. per lb. above the average price, they found that they received, on an average, only about l l $ d . per lb. It is my opinion that they are being exploited by some of those who retained their connection with foreign 1 firms, and who are acting in this way with an eye to the post-war position. Some men who owned wool stores of their own were making before the war incomes of £2,000 to £2,500 a year. Now, their businesses have gone, and they have been relegated to junior positions equal to those of boys with an average knowledge of wool. have listened with interest to speeches made in this House by the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) during the last two years.

106,"Mr Baker ""(Maranoa) [4.10]","IHe has my sympathy. His lapse may be due to the fact that he is getting on in years. On this occasion he has merely put up an Aunt Sally, his purpose being to discredit the Government. Obviously, he, and other honourable members opposite, believe that an election is in the offing. A politician has been described as one who sits on the fence but keeps his ear to the ground. That is an apt description of honourable members opposite so far as their attitude on this matter for it "". I repliedis concerned. They are seeking simply to discredit the Government by making attacks upon the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman). The number of sheep now in Australia is between 120,000,000 and 125,000,000. Wool is our greatest industry. It brings into this country over £60,000,000 a year. That income is not sectional; it is national. Naturally, the Minister has taken prompt steps to organize the industry in order to improve our war effort. The ramifications of the industry are extensive. We are faced with the problems of transporting, cleaning, selling, storing and appraising the wool. This requires considerable organization. The Minister is organizing the industry on a war basis. In the past much of our wool has been stored in coastal centres. To-day, in view of the possibility of enemy action, we are now obliged to move it to centres as far as 200 miles inland. We do not own that wool. It belongs to Great Britain, and this Government is merely the custodian of it. Much of the organizing work associated with the industry is the responsibility of the Central Wool Committee. That is representative of all interests engaged in the industry, although, incidentally, I should like to give greater representation on it to the primary producers. Everything possible is being done to place the industry on a war footing. Great Britain has applied a policy of intensive organization to many ind<ustries. For instance, agricultural producers are told what they shall produce. If they fail to use suitable land it is taken from them. That is what might be described as intensive organization, and the Government is to apply that policy in Australia. [47 ] This motion reflects little credit upon the Opposition. However, it is in keeping with an interlude which occurred when I was speaking on the budget. AfterI had stated that the wool agreement, which was signed in 1939, contained a clause providing for an annual review of the price, provided either party to the agreement asked for it, the honourable member for New England interjected ""Rot! We were always asking Nobody, not even tbe United Country party, which professes to represent the wool-growers, lifted a finger on behalf of the wool-growers until this Government came into office, and the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) went to Great Britain, asked for a rise of price by 15 per cent., and got it . The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) then interjected, ""That rise was obtained by the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) "". with it. He knew nothing about it until it, was done. Attorney-General is present to give the lie direct to the statement then made by the Leader of the Opposition. -The honourable member must withdraw that expression; it is unparliamentary. I emphasize is that honourable members opposite are simply endeavouring to discredit the Government. They adopt the attitude that whatever the Government does is wrong; therefore, it should not do anything. In spite of that attitude on the part of honourable members opposite, the Government is determined to prosecute the war to the best of its ability; and it has already shown itself to be better equipped for that purpose than was any of its predecessors. Mr 'MARWICK (Swan) [4.17] I regret the statement by the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Baker) that this motion has been submitted merely for political reasons. That charge no longer impresses. No reason would have existed for a motion of this kind, but for the statement made by the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) and reported in the press on the 3rd September. The Minister says that he",27,Rationalization Of Wool Industry Format Motion For Adjournment

109,Mr Speaker (Hon. W. M. Nairn).,,28,Rationalization Of Wool Industry Format Motion For Adjournment
110,Mr Baker,"I withdraw. The pointdoes not take muck notice of reports appearing in the Melbourne Herald. I remind him that identical reports appeared in every newspaper throughout the Commonwealth. Surely, the Minister does not say that every newspaper in this country would misrepresent him in such a matter. We can only conclude that that report was based on a typed statement distributed on behalf of the Minister to the press. I take the following extracts from the report which was published in the West Australian, on the 3rdSeptember last, and was identical, word for word, with the report in every other daily newspaper:Far-reaching recommendations designed to rationalize the wool industry have been adopted by the Federal Government. These include measures to conserve labour and transport as a substantial contribution to war needs, and also proposals that wool-growers should voluntarily reduce their flocks, both in their own interests and those of the nation. After pointing out that grave concern had been expressed at the tendency for sheep numbers and tlie -wool clip to increase from year to year in excess of the quantities required under war conditions, Mr Dedman said tbe Government confidently expected wool-gro.wers would co-operate to stabilize sheep numbers and the wool clip, so as to supply home and export needs for lamb and mutton. Only in the event of voluntary co-operation failing would the Government contemplate other measures to achieve these objectives, he added. Three days later, on the 8th September, the Minister published a correction in the Brisbane Courier-Mail. It is most unfair of him to say that the Canberra representatives of all the metropolitan newspapers misreported him. Every newspaper contained exactly the same statement. Its publication caused alarm in the pastoral industry throughout Australia. Most honourable members received telegrams of protest. I received many telegrams from Western Australia, and I had to refer to the newspapers to find out what he had said. made the statement? he was not responsible for what the Argus had reported him as saying, but that newspaper's report was repeated in every other newspaper. The honourable member for New England and I lodged our protests with the Minister. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson), who was in Adelaide and read the statement in the Adelaide press, also protested. I am pleased that the Minister does not intend to rationalize the pastoral industry, and that he has now departed from the policy which he, undoubtedly, announced. No industry in Australia produces, with so little manpower, such enormous wealth or such important products as do the wool and meat industries. God only knows that the pastoral industry suffers enough hardship from drought, disease and floods, without having to suffer the final hardship of political interference. This is the only primary industry which has been able to survive without propping front the Government. I hope that this time the Minister will stand by what he says and refrain from attempting to apply to the pastoral industry methods which may be all right when applied to backyard industries. The Government will experience enough trouble in the next two or three months in trying to organize the slaughtering of the mutton and lamb that will soon be coming on to the market. The Minister'sadvisers would be well employed in trying to devise means to ensure the availability of sufficient men to enable the slaughtering to be done in order that Britain's requirements of lamb and mutton may be met. glad that the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) and his tory colleagues have raised this matter, because it provides me with the opportunity to contrast the raw deal that the primary industries had at the hands of the Government which they supported against the improved conditions that they have obtained since the Labour party took office. They sat dumb in their places when the Menzies 'Government sold to Great Britain the whole Australian wool clip at an average price of 10d. per lb. in Australian currency, which is far below the cost of production, and thereafter they made no effort to induce that Government to take advantage of the provision for an annual review of the price. It required the advent to power of this party for the pleas of the wool-growers for a better return to be answered.

113,Mr Mcleod (Wannon) [4.25],"I amthe Australian wool-growers to any increase of the contract price arranged between the governments of Australia and Great Britain, and it was only by the efforts of this Government, aided by the Attorney-General in London, that the increase was obtained. For many years now the Australian wool business has been a racket. This great commodity has been put up for sale here and disposed of at low rates to buyers from other countries who came to Australia, supposedly, to bid for it against each other. In respect of the sale of other primary commodities grown in Australia, we have had to go outside our own country for markets, and have sometimes had to sell at a loss, and give subsidies to the farmers to enable them to stay on the land. Our wool was sold here below the cost of production in 1939. Honourable members opposite are trying by means of this motion to make out that they are the only friends of the wool-growers, and to twist statements made by the Minister for ""War Organization of Industry( Mr tunity which has been given to the MinisDedman) in order to persuade the public that the Government and its supporters are seeking to destroy the wool industry. The movement for the curtailment of flocks is very necessary. The farmers themselves are asking for it, and are pleased that the Government proposes to set up dehydration plants in various parts of the Commonwealth to get rid of the surplus sheep. I and others on the land are worried because we are short of superphosphates. That fact curtails production. Large numbers of lambs were previously sent overseas, but that trade is now cut out. Curtailment of flocks is necessary, which is what the Minister was referring to. The attempt by honourable members opposite to make out that the Minister is acting detrimentally to the great wool industry will deceive no one. In the short ten months that we have been in power we have done greater service to the farmers and graziers than the so-called Country party, and the governments that it has supported, have done in fifteen years. They should have thought twice before moving the adjournment of the House to discuss the wool industry. One of their governments sold the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line which was bringing about a reduction of overseas freights on primary produce, including wool. The ships were really given away, because so far Australia has not been paid for them. Another government of the same type, by limiting the powers of the Commonwealth Bank, prevented money from being available to the grazing industry when it sorely needed help. It is a great disgrace that our wool should have been sold for so many years below the cost of production. It was noticeable that, when wool was sold at as low as lOd. per lb., no reduction of the price of cloth was made in favour of the user. The honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) is four years late in moving the adjournment of the House to discuss this subject. However, if he has done nothing else, he has done a service by showing the public that members of the Opposition have been making statements in the press which are not true, trying to persuade the farmers that our actions have been detrimental to the wool industry. I am glad, of the opporter and others on this side to refute and debunk the claim of the Opposition to be the true protectors of that industry. useless for honourable members opposite to assert that the representatives of the wool and wheat industries on this side of the House take no interest in them. Their claim that the present Government has done more for those industries than we have is easily disproved. In 1939, when the war began, our wool prices went down to lOd. per lb., as in 1914. We put forward the needs of both industries all through the years from 1930 to 1939, and beat the Government of the day on the question of wheat. The Government led by the right honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Fadden) took over the wheat in 1939 and sold it, in spite of the low prices prevailing in the world's market, for a realized price of 3s. 6id. a bushel. By contrast, the average which will be paid by the present Government under the so-called stabilization scheme will not yield 3s. a bushel to all the wheat-growers throughout Australia. Only men growing a few hundred bushels will get so high a return as 3s. 6£d.",29,Rationalization Of Wool Industry Format Motion For Adjournment
114,Mr Badman (Grey) [4.35],"It isAustralia is the greatest wool-producing country in the world, and its wool industry is something well worth fighting for. In the last war, our wool production £60,000,000 a year to the grower. At that time, we were producing only about 2,000,000 bales per annum. ""We are now producing over 3,000,000 bales. When the Central Wool Committee took over the wool clip in 1916, it commenced a huge operation. It handled over 7,000,000 balt3 of wool between the 21st November, 1916, and the 30th June, 1920. It sold that, wool to the British Government at Is. 3^d. per lb., under an agreement made between the then Prime Minister of Australia Milner. The fixed price of Is. 3-Jd. per lb. was 55 per cent, above the rate ruling at the 1913-14 wool sales. When the term of the Central Wool Committee expired on the 30th June, 1920, it had sold over 4,000,000 bales of wool, and Australia had received an extra £6,000,000, representing 55 per cent, of the profits, The balance of wool remaining in London was taken over by Bawra, and sold at prices which eventually realized, for the Australian growers, Is. 9£d. per lb. all round, or 6d. better than the appraised price. Another 6d. per lb. went to the British Government. Australia reaped a return of £39,000,000 out of the profits, whilst Great Britain took £36,000,000, That was the outcome of the last wool realization scheme introduced during the 1914-1S war. The honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) has now asked for some alterations to be made in regard to the proposed rationalization of the wool industry. I stand behind him in that. In spite of what the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Baker) said, there is no man in Australia who has a greater knowledge of the wool industry, or has done more for it here, than the honourable member for New England. His name is known all over the world as a man of high standing in the industry. We accept his word as authoritative. It would have been better if all Australian governments had taken into their confidence members representing different industries which it was proposed to deal. The Minister for War Organization of InMr Badman. dustry has been dabbling in rationalizing this and that. He thought he would rationalize something else, but when he found that he had made a mistake, he averaged a return of dropped it like a hot potato, explaining that he did not want or intend to do it. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Marwick) nailed down some of the Minister's statements, and all that the Minister could do was smile. The Minister should be more sincere in these matters. The wool industry demands the best possible attention, and any one who meddles or muddles should be replaced. If a Minister attempts to introduce an unfair policy, he should not be tolerated. To-day, ( Mr Hughes) and Lord the industry is desperately in need of man-power. It has only a skeleton staff. When shearers are required, they are allotted by officials-the Deputy Director of Man Power in Adelaide, for instance -wh o have no knowledge of the requirements of the industry. Recently, I received a petition from fourteen farmers in my electorate. They .desired to obtain the services of shearers to handle 6,700 sheep. Two brothers, who early this year had enlisted in the Australian Imperial Eorce, were anxious to do the work, and as no other men were available application was made for their temporary release from the Army. Two men, each of whom shears an average of 100 sheep a day, would require 33 days in which to handle 6,700. An average of 100 sheep a day would be a splendid achievement. Because of wet weather, it is possible that the men would not be able to work more than three days a week. But the man-power authorities, who think that they know so much about the wool industry, wrote the following letter to me:Re Pte. K. C. Kerley, G. D. D., Wayvi lie, SX17977 and Pte. H. R. Kerley, 1st Aust. Div. Mobile Laundry. In reply to your letter of the 13th instant, you are informed that the Deputy Director General recommended that three weeks leave be granted Pte. K. C. Kerley. Regarding Pte. H. R. Kerley leave could not be recommended as his unit was out of this State. with PrivateH . R. Kerley, I ascertained, could not be released for this essential"" work because he was attached to a mobile laundry unit. His brother was expected to shear 6,745 sheep in three weeks. Obviously, that was ridiculous. It betrayed an utter lack of even elementary knowledge of the industry. Yet that is typical of the blunders of the staff of the Department of W;ar Organization of Industry, and the Department of Labour and National Service. I support the attempt of the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) to replace these inefficient men with others who have a thorough knowledge of the industry. principal complaint of the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) is that the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) has introduced a scheme to rationalize the pastoral induntry, but the graziers' interests have not been consulted in the matter. In my opinion, the Minister dealt most effectively with the submissions of the honourable member. One of the objects of rationalizing the pastoral industry is to save the unnecessary use of railway rolling-stock in the transport of wool. It should not be necessary for me to emphasize the urgent need for making the best possible use of transport facilities within Australia. So great are the demands that our railways cannot cope with the business. The proposal of the Minister will result in a. considerable saving of rolling-stock, and in that way the national interests will be served. Another proposal of the Government concerns the storage of wool. The Government of the United Kingdom is buying the Australian wool clip from the Commonwealth Government. The procedure is that the Commonwealthacquires the whole of the Australian clip, and sells it to the British Government at an agreed price. But the British Government ships only such wool as it requires for immediate use; the remainder is stored in Australia. The Commonwealth Government proposes that wool required for immediate shipment shall be carried to the ports, but that other types of wool, which will not be required for some time, shall be stored at country centres in order to save the unnecessary use of rolling-stock. The wisdom of the scheme must appeal to honourable members, and I compliment the Government upon having evolved it -what the functions of his department The Minister also considers that action must be taken in order to obtain adequate supplies of mutton for dehydration and canning purposes. The Government has to provide substantial quantities of canned and dehydrated meat to meet the requirements of our fighting forces in New Guinea and elsewhere. Because of lack of supplies, some dehydration plants have not been operating at full capacity. The Government intends to establish additional units throughout Australia, and must take steps to ensure continuity and adequacy of supplies. The increased price which the Government has obtained for wool haa been instrumental in some measure in inducing graziers to hold their stock instead of sending it .to dehydration and canning plants as they would normally do. In view of the reply given by the Minister, it appears that the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) has been flogging a dead horse. There can be no complaint about what has been done by the Government. The Minister read to honourable members a copy of a letter which had been sent out to various pastoral organizations, inviting them to send representatives to confer with the Minister, or to forward such information as they thought should be brought under the notice of the Government. Before taking any action to rationalize this industry, the Minister sought the co-operation and assistance of those engaged in it. That is a practice that has been followed in connection with every industry. I assure honourable members that it is not a happy or pleasant job to interfere with any industry, but there are times when such action is essential in order to make sufficient manpower available for the defence of this country, for ""the production of arms and munitions, and for the provision of adequate supplies of foodstuffs. It is the Minister's responsibility to do the job, whether it be pleasant or not. A Minister for War Organization of Industry was appointed by the Menzies Government, and on two or three occasions in this HouseI asked him questions relating to his activities. I was informed that the Minister had not found out precisely",30,Rationalization Of Wool Industry Format Motion For Adjournment
115,Mr Clark (Darling) [4.44],"Th ewere, but that at a later stage he hoped to have some information in that regard. Although that honourable member held office for a considerable time, no action in the direction of rationalizing industry was taken, and the job remained' to be tackled by this Government. 1 contend that the present Minister for War Organization of Industry has carried out his work to the satisfaction of a great number of people in the community. No doubt, his actions have caused displeasure in certain quarters, but in performing a task which must necessarily interfere with certain privileges enjoyed by established interests-, a certain amount of displeasure cannot be avoided. I repeat that the Government has always applied the policy of consulting whatever interests are concerned in any action that it proposes to take. Particularly has this been the case in regard to primary industries. The sympathetic attitude of the Government towards the interests of people engaged -in various pastoralist and agricultural callings indicates that the job is in good hands. The Central Wool Committee which, as the honourable member for New England said, controls the wool industry, was consulted when the scheme for th\sale of wool to Great Britain was inaugurated, but many complaints were voiced in this Parliament and in the press that the wool-growers themselves had not been consulted. It was contended that the price which had been fixed was an unfair one, and would mean that the growing of wool would be a non-paying proposition. The wool-growers wanted' to know who had agreed to the proposal. Apparently, they had not been consulted at all. The honourable member for New England said that he was consulted. said that members of the Central Wool take action in this House on behalf of Committee, and growers' representatives the wool-growers of Australia. I draw on the committee has been consulted. following report which appeared in the in May, 1940 :Sydney Morning Herald on the 30th June, 1942:As a member of the Central Wool Committee, regard to the wheat industry, as to both the Mr Abbott said that be was present when negotiations took place for the war-time sale stabilization to be adopted for the coming „of the Australian clip. A further report appeared in the same newspaper on the 11th June, 1940, statingMr J. P. Abbott, Chairman of the Australian Wool growers' Council said yesterday that lie entirely agreed with the statement by the Minister for Commerce, Mr Cameron, that there should be no negotiations with the British Government this year for a change in the price of the Australian wool clip. true. That was the week that France fell. -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. my opinion, the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) has rendered a service by the 'action that he has taken this afternoon. However, since the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) has admitted that the Government has no intention of attempting to rationalize the wool industry, the purpose of this motion seems to have been served, and I understand that the honourable member for New England agrees with that. I should not have risen had it not been for the irresponsible remarks made by the honourable "" Johnny-come-lately "" in this chamber, who made bald statements without making any attempt whatever to confirm them. On many occasions since the inauguration of agreements for tbe sale of our primary products to Great BritainI have asked in this chamber when a review of the agreements would take place. orable member's questions had little effect upon the Government which he supported. the attention of the honourable member Before the present sittings of the House are concluded will a statement be made indicating the intentions of tlie Government with question of an advance and any form of year?

Will a statement be made, further, as to whether the wool purchase agreement will be reviewed, having regard to the increased cost of production? In reply, the then Ministerf o j Commerce( Mr Archie Cameron) informed me that the contracts were subject to constant review. On the 31st May, I again addressed the House on this matter. A l though the wool-growers met and determined as a body not to press the request for an increased price in view of the position in the United Kingdom at that time, I did not cease to press for a review, having regard to such factors as the increased cost of fertilizer, and the honourable member for Wannon should have acquainted himself of that fact. It is degrading the national Parliament when an honourable member makes irresponsible statements of the kind made by the honourable member for Wannon. until a Labour government came into power. If the previous Government had remained in office nothing would have been done. the Attorney-General would claim that Australian wool-growers would not have been granted an increase when increases were being granted in all other parts of the Empire. Furthermore, it would not have been very difficult to obtain a greater increase of the price for Australian wool than was allowed. It is disgusting that FO many irresponsible statements should be made in this House. I do not object to the truth being told. country in which the increase was granted. received a much greater increase than did Australian growers, and costs of production in Australia have increased more than they have in any other country. honourable member for Cowper was not concerned in the matter at all. Furthermore, increases were not made in the other dominions until after the Commonwealth Government had secured an increase. satisfied with that statement, but a political statement having no foundation in fact has been made. Does the Attorney General claim that, if any representative of Australia other than himself had made the request for an increase, the result would.have been different? The review was overdue, and I believe that the increase could have been more generous than it was. also am astonished at the belated action of members of the Opposition in bringing this matter before the Government. Over three weeks have elapsed since press reports of the alleged statement by the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman) were published. Immediately the announcement appeared, I approached the Minister in order to learn the exact position, because I would have been one of the first to protest against any proposal to impose restrictions upon the pastoral industry. Honourable members"" opposite, who are now parading their supposed sympathy for the industry, offered no help to pastoralists in Western Australia when they were almost driven off the laud by drought and other conditions over which they had no control. In five years, their flocks were reduced by over 3,000,000 sheep, but the governments at that time provided no relief .to the industry. The attack upon the Government to-day is in keeping with the instructions issued to honourable members opposite in the party circular which was read to this House by the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) recently. Honourable members opposite cannot truthfully deny my statement. Had they been as anxious about the wool industry, or the pastoral industry generally, as they claim to be, they would not have allowed a period of three weeks to elapse before raising the matter. Not one of them has approached the Minister to ascertain What truth there was in the newspaper reports. 1941, the newspapers published the following report of a statement made by the then Minister for Commerce( Sir Earlc Page) :No variation of the present price for Australian wool agreed on under the imperial",33,Rationalization Of Wool Industry Format Motion For Adjournment

That demonstrates clearly the attitude of honourable members opposite towards the pastoral industry. ber in favour of curtailing flocks? first to protest against such .a proposal. I should not wait for three weeks, as the honourable member did, until he was told by his party to raise the matter in order to impede the war effort and delay the business of the Parliament. The honourable gentleman offered no genuine criticism of the Government's plans. He neglected opportunities to interview the Minister and ascertain the exact position. The honourable member for Swan( Mr This measure is very brief, and is Marwick) said that he was pleased to hear the statement of the Minister. He could have obtained the information contained in that statement three weeks ago. vouring to obtain it for three weeks. M*r.

""When I was elected to this Parliament, I referred to that body as a "" centralization committee"", but I received no support from honourable members opposite. The small wool growers have been penalized for years owing to the lack of a plan to cope with the problems of the wool industry. Ever since I became a member .of this Parliament I have been endeavouring to induce various Ministers to adopt a. policy of decentralization. I have proved in this House before that 95,000 bales of wool would have passed through Geraldton each year if an appraisement centre had been -established there, but the previous Government refused to establish a centre, and, as a result, farmers in the Victoria district and adjacent areas of ""Western Australia, had to pay an extra 8s. or 10s. a bale in rail ' charges in order to gratify the wishes of the big brokers whose interests honourable members oppoDebate interrupted under Standing Order 257B.

Before the 22nd November, 1940, concrete and other building materials were exempt from sales tax. On that date, because of the growing need of revenue for war purposes, the government of the day amended the law to withdraw those exemptions, and concrete became subject to tax at the minimum rate of 5 per cent. It was specified for that purpose in the Second Schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935-1940. The Commissioner of Taxation proceeded to collect tax on those goods from building contractors and other manufacturers of concrete. In view of the greatly increased need of revenue, the present Government introduced an amendment of the law on the 30th October, 1941, to cause concrete and other building materials to become taxable at the higher rate applicable to the general field of goods. That was achieved by omitting concrete from the Second Schedule. From that time, concrete has not been specified in any schedule of the act, nor are any of the goods in the general field so specified.",34,Rationalization Of Wool Industry Format Motion For Adjournment

139,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"TreaThe collection of tax at the higher rate proceeded recently, when certain authorities which make concrete for their own use disputed their liability to pay tax on that commodity. They claimed that concrete was excluded from liability for sales tax by the definition of "" manufacture"" in the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1) 1930-1940. That definition reads"" Manufacture"" includes production, and also the combination of parts or ingredients whereby an article or substance is formed which is commercially distinct from those parts or ingredients, except such combination as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is customary or reasonably practicable for users or consumers of those articles or substances to undertake, and also includes any treatment applied to foodstuffs as a process in the preparation of the foodstuffs for human consumption; "". The excepting words were inserted in the law of 1932, solely with the object of excluding from the scope of the tax simple acts of assembling which are performed by retailers, for example, the attachment of handles to lawnmowers and brooms. upon by the authorities concerned in support of their contention that concrete is not taxable. Their claim is that the production of concrete is brought about by a combination of ingredients which users of concrete, for example, building contractors, customarily undertake. The effect of this definition had not been overlooked by the Commissioner when he commenced to collect tax on concrete. At that time, however, he was in a position to point to the specification of concrete in the Second Schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act as clear evidence of the intention of Parliament that concrete was to be taxed, and he was advised by the Crown Solicitor that this specification would, as a particular provision, prevail in law over the general provisions of the definition of <: manufacture "". Since the amendment in October, 1941, liowever, there has been no such specification which could be relied upon by the department, and, therefore, there is no clear authority for the collection of the tax, although it has been the obvious intention of Parliament since the 22nd November, 1940, that tbe tax should be payable. In view of that intention, without challenge until and the fact that the vast majority of taxpayers have complied w i th it by paying tax on the concrete made by them, it is considered that the few taxpayers who have disputed their liability should not be permitted to escape tax by a mere technicality. The bill is, therefore, in troduced for the purpose of making it clear that the production of concrete is not outside the scope of the tax. It is proposed that the amendment effected by the bill shall be deemed to have commenced . on the 30th October, 1941, i.e., since there has been no specification of concrete in any of the sales tax schedules. Does this bill provide for the raising of more money? 2 per cent, of the users of concrete who, on technical grounds, have escaped their liability to pay sales tax, w ill no longer escape. fourteen amendments of the principal act, Those words are relied and this is the fifteenth.

The Opposition holds the view that .there 'is no necessity whatever to rush this bill through the Parliament in the dying hours of the present sittings. The measure will probably lead to a great deal of confusion in the public mind at a time when the people should be united for one purpose only. The bill proposed to be introduced is not new. A similar measure was introduced in 1937. The war has been in progress for three years, and the present Government has been in power for one year; therefore, the Opposition sees no justification for the introduction of the measure in order to rush it to the second-reading and final stages during the present sittings. Unless the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) is prepared to undertake that after the second reading has been moved by him the debate will be adjourned to a future sitting of the House, in order that such an important matter may be understood by the people of Australia, the Opposition will not grant leave for the introduction of the bill. I hope that the Attorney-General (DrI support the observations of the Evatt) will not accept the intolerable conditions laid down by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden). The bill sought to be introduced ought to pass during this sessional period. The second reading of it should be made an order of the day for to-morrow, and when the Attorney-General had made the second reading speech the debate ought to be adjourned until next week, in order that honourable members might have an opportunity to consider the matter fully. It is quite right and proper that legislation of this character should not be rushed. It would be scandalous if an attempt were made to push the bill through both Houses to-morrow. If the Attorney General is to be believed-and I believe him implicitly-thi s legislation is necessary. I cannot see one valid reason why this House should not sit next week, and the following week if necessary, in order to deal exclusively with this legislation and the referendum proposals of the Government. being given an opportunity to study it? ample opportunity to acquaint itself of the provisions of the Statute of Westminster, since the Imperial Conference in 1926 determined its form. In that year, legislation was passed by the I m perial Parliament, and that is the origin of the title ""Statute of Westminster"". Many years ago, it was adopted by the Dominion of Canada. Australia has been very tardy in now doing what it ought to have done long ago. The right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies), as Prime Minister, a few years ago introduced a bill to adopt certain sections of the Statute of Westminster. Prior to that, the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), as Prime Minister, had introduced a similar measure. The Attorney-General should be assisted in every way to pass this legislation. The Opposition ought to grant leave for its introduction. It would be in the best interests of tbe nation if the Attorney-General were given the opportunity to move the second reading of the bill. Let the measure be passed by at least the end of next week. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden). I can see no reason whatever, at this period of the history of this Parliament and country, for the introduction of such a measure. The matter has remained quiescent since 1931. The taking of this step has been delayed until a war is affecting us grievously. The public has regarded action of this sort as tantamount to finally cutting adrift from the Empire, and has opposed it since 1931. In the throes of the worse war and the greatest crisis through which the Empire has passed, a government that has no mandate from the people, but occupied the treasury bench upon the defeat of the previous Administration on its budget proposals, and representing barely 50 per cent, of the people of this country, has the temerity to bring forward a measure that is vital to. the nation, in an endeavour to rush it through",36,Statute Of Westminste R Adoptionbill 1942

By no stretch of the imagination could it be suggested that the introhave, however, outlived that period.

I recent years I have never known of an instance in which a Minister at the table has met with opposition when moving for leave to introduce a bill.

I agree that any Opposition is entitled to a proper opportunity to consider any measure introduced into this House. Less time, of course, is required for the consideration of some bills than of others. This bill is peculiar in that, in substance, it has been already agreed to by all parties in the House. On the Opposition side is my friend, the distinguished lawyer, the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies), who himself introduced, and moved the second reading of, a bill that had precisely the same intention and purpose as this measure.

174,Mr Brennan,"When you intersubject that I do not require time to prepare further matter. This legislation has been pending for twelve years, and every one, except a few diehards like the honourable member for Wentwoirth ( Mr to say whether there is or is not justificaHarrison), agree that it should be passed if we are not to break faith with the Mother of Parliaments. An undertaking was given to the Government of Great Britain, pursuant to an arrangement entered into at the Imperial Conference in 1930, that the Commonwealth Parliament would adopt the Statute of Westminster. We have failed to do so, so that we have broken faith, not only with our own people, but also with the Government of Great Britain. We have left that Government in the lurch during the last twelve years. The Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) spoke in a conciliatory tone to. members of the Opposition, but they were so little conciliated, and interwith the Government of the United Kingrupted so freely, that I was not able to hear all that the Prime Minister said. The proper course is for the House to give leave to the Attorney-General without imposing conditions which I regard as offensive. The Leader of the Opposition is not usually offensive, but it is in fact tunately, we seem to be drifting in that offensive to seek to impose terms on the Attorney-General when he asks leave to bring in a bill. It is an unheard of condition. the right to explain a bill which he is peculiarly well qualified to explain. I suggest that the bill be introduced, and read a first time. I should will overcome small legislative diffinot object to hearing the second-reading speech of the Attorney-General, which I am sure would be both interesting and enlightening. Afterwards, I would expect the Leader of the Opposition would ask for the adjournment of the debate, and it would be given to him. Later, the bill would be debated, and as much time should be allowed for the discussion as even my rhetorical friend the honourable member for Wentworth, might require. The Opposition refused leave to introduce this bill, not so much for the purpose of preventing discussion on the merits of the measure, as to prevent something from being thrown into the ring which, at this particular juncture, would not tend to promote unity in the country. The incidents which have occurred in this House this afternoon indicate the inflammatory nature of the material which this bill contains. At this stage, I do not propose tion for opposing the bill on its merits, but there can be no doubt in the mind of any unbiased observer what the reactions in this House, and, indeed, throughout the country, would be if the bill were debated. It could only create a tremendous division of opinion throughout the country at a time when the greatest measure of unity is needed. Measures similar to this bill have been before Parliament from time to time during the last twelve years, so there can be no urgency about this particular bill at this time. We have been able to carry on for twelve years, in peace and in war, without this legislation. Our relations dom have been satisfactory during all that time, so surely there is no reason now for pressing on with the measure which is bound to create division of opinion. This is a matter which should not be dealt with on party lines. Unfordirection. I suggest to the Government, if it. desires to prevent division among the Australian people, and to avoid a It denies the Minister misunderstanding of the attitude of Australia towards the Empire and the other dominions, that it should not proceed with this measure. It is claimed that it culties. Those difficulties can be overcome by other and simpler means. However, the Government seeks to balance those difficulties against the enormous damage which will be done if this measure be proceeded with at this stage. Behind the scenes, I have endeavoured to the best of my ability to prevent this measure from being proceeded with. In the interests of the Empire's unity, and in order to prevent ammunition for propaganda from being given to our enemies, the Government should postpone the introduction of this measure. This measure is not brought forward merely for the sake of ratifying a measure that was passed eleven years ago. The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) brings it down because he is of opinion,",39,Statute Of Westminste R Adoptionbill 1942

We have the assurance of not only the political head of the Law Department that those difficulties exist, but also the permanenthead, who also agrees that they can be removed by the enactment of sections 2 to 6 of the Statute of Westminster.

We should not do anything that is reasonably likely to impair our national unity, or arouse -misunderstanding of our action on the part of other countries. If the enactment of these sections is not necessary, this bill should not be introduced. However, if I am assured that this bill, although it may not actually be necessary, will facilitate the drafting of war measures by removing difficulties which cannot otherwise be surmounted, I support its introduction. intervened during the last three years of war to render the introduction of this measure necessary? All I know is that the permanent head of the Law Department says that difficulties have arisen, and that they would be removed by the enactment of sections to make the drafting of measures easier? enable the draftsman to do with legislative certainty things which he cannot now do with that certainty.

If honourable members study the measure closely, they will see that it contains nothing which is likely to threaten national unity, or loosen the bond between Australia and the Mother Country. I listened to the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) with some surprise. He said that it was unheard of in this House for a Minister's motion for leave to introduce a bill to be opposed. The honourable member , must have a short memory. occasions leave has been opposed; and there is nothing wrong with that practice. The honourable member's speech was just another little contribution towards the propaganda which is being persistently put before the country to the effect that the Opposition is trying to obstruct the Government's legislative programme.

I appeal to the Government not to proceed on its present course. We and our allies are up against a far bigger problem than that presented to the House as the reason for the introduction of this measure.

Until now, I had reason to think that our representations to him had borne fruit and that he would not proceed with this measure. The fact that he is trying to do so indicates that behind him are forces that will not allow him do that which I think he wishes to do.

197,Mr Morgan,"Then set a goodcome from both sides of the House. This matter should be discussed dispassionately, because the issues involved transcend in importance many of the other subjects brought before this Parliament. They are fundamental issues, although the terms of the schedule are very limited legally. Asi t appears to me, the issue before the chamber is whether the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) shall be given leave to bring in a bill for an act to remove doubts as to the validity of certain Commonwealth legislation, to obviate delays occurring in its passage, and to effect certain related purposes, by adopting specified sections of the Statute of Westminster, 1931, as from the commencement of the war between His Majesty the K in g and Germany. Speaking for myself, I have no hesitation in saying that leave should be given, and I regret that heat should have been displayed by some honourable members, because it will serve, not ourselves, but the enemy. We should seek to discover precisely the issues to be considered. 1 deeply regret that the bill has been introduced, because it is impossible to explain to the people the issues involved in it. Misunderstandings w ill be created throughout the country, but if an attempt were made to educate the people upon this subject, I believe that those who are opposed to this legislation might adopt a different attitude towards it . But what impresses me as being extraordinary is that, at this stage of the war, it has been found necessary to introduce a bill to adopt the Statute of Westminster, although three years of administration have not revealed any pressing need for it. If the bill had been introduced before the outbreak of war. my view upon ir would have been entirely different. If the matter could be discussed dispassionately and the people could understand precisely how limited is the issue, again my approach to the subject would be quite different. But it is because I do not consider that the people will be able quickly to understand a legal statute and' its effect upon the constitutional relationship between the United Kingdom Government, Australia and dominions, or appreciated the finer implications of some of the provisions, that 1 believe the bill will have a very serious effect on our people. ately misled. ment of my speech I expressed the hope that honourable members would retrain from recriminations, and deal with the subject upon its merits. If I may review the subject quickly, the position is that the constitutional relations between the United Kingdom Government and the Dominions will not be altered by this legislation. In 1926 and 1930, conferences were held between the United Kingdom Government and the dominions, and the parties agreed to certain resolutions, the effect of which was translated into legal phraseology by the Statute of Westminster. Whether the statesmen who attended those conferences and who in the space of four years sought to formalize the relationships between the Crown and the Dominions were wise in seeking thus to replace 400 years of legal growth and constitutional development is another matter. I have my own views upon it . gentleman making a second-reading speech ? to avoid that. should avoid it . seeking to avoid making a second-reading speech; I am pointing out the issues in the hope, vain though it appears to be. that the House will deal with.the merits of the motion.

Surely, honourable members are in order in referring to the Statute of Westminster when debating this motion. As the Statute of Westminster is a public document, the honourable member should not be debarred by the procedure of the House from referring to it. Mr .SPEAKER,-The position is well stated by the honourable member for Fawkner. So long as the honourable member for Warringah limits his references to the contents of the bill there will be no objection. the Statute of Westminster makes it perfectly plain that no question of status is involved in the bill. The preamble points out that it would be in accord with the established constitutional practice of all members of the Commonwealth in relation to one another that any alteration of the law touching the succession to the Throne should be with the consent of all. That is not altered by the bill. The Honourable members may second proposition is that I t is in accordance with the established constitutional position that no law hereafter made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall extend to any of the said dominions as part of the law of that dominion otherwise than at the request and with the consent of that dominion. That paragraph of the preamble has little to do with this measure. It was constitutional practice before the Statute of Westminster was drawn up, and continues so to remain. The sections which are to be adopted by the bill are sections 2 to 6. I shall refer to them briefly. Section2 provides that the Colonial Laws any law made after the commencement of this act by the Parliament of a dominion. In short, any law of this Parliament shall not be held to be void because it conflicts with Imperial law. Section3 readsI t is hereby declared and enacted that the Parliament of a dominion has full power to make laws having extra-territorial operation. That section is most important, because it confers upon this Parliament extended powers in respect of a number I rise to order. Although of matters, except insofar as they are not within the expressed powers of the States. Section 4! statesNo act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed after the commencement of this act shall extend, or be deemed to extend, to a dominion as part of the law of that dominion, unless it is expressly declared in that act that that dominion has requested, and consented to, the enactment thereof. I have already drawn attention to the preamble touching this subject-matter. Section5 deals with the powers of dominion Parliaments in relation to merchant shipping, and section 6 readsWithout prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provisions of this act, section 4 of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act 1890 (which requires certain laws, to be reserved for the signification of His Majesty's pleasure or to contain a suspending clause), and so much of section 7 of that act as requires the approval of His Majesty in Council to any rules of court for regulating the practice and procedure of a Colonial Court of Admiralty, shall cease to have effect in any dominion as from the commencement of this act.",44,Statute Of Westminste R Adoptionbill 1942

The sole purpose of the bill is, therefore, to adopt and I oppose its introduction now. The those five sections of the Statute of Westminster. understand that, -the issue will be clear to them. There is no point in retracing the past for the purpose of deciding whether the statesmen who drew up the Statute of Westminster were right .or wrong in what they did. Although the issue in the bill is limited, it is imsum the matter up very briefly by possible to make that clear to the public aud misconception will arise both inside and outside Australia. clarifying the issue for the public. an issue clear to all honourable members in this chamber, it is a good accomplishment; but it would be more than a miracle if he could clarify the issue for the whole of the people. The Attorney-General would be well advised not to proceed beyond the second-reading stage. A great deal of harm may come from passing this bill, not because of its intrinsic merits, but because of the misunderstanding that may arise inside and outside Australia. For my part I believe that the Attorney-General should make his second^reading speech, and agree to an adjournment of the debate for tbe purpose of ascertaining whether a better approach can be made to the matter by first educating the people. In any event, I support the motion that leave be given to introduce the billrecord my protest against the haste in which this hill has been introduced. The expressed purpose of tbe legislation is to remove doubts as to the validity of certain Commonwealth acts. If the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) believes that to be so, why did he not introduce the bill early in the session instead of at the eleventh hour? It is most unfair to the States and to the people to attempt to rush this legislation have copies of the bill circulated. through Parliament at this juncture. The States were not represented at the Imperial Conference which drew up the Statute of Westminster. In fairness, the Attorney-iGeneral should not attempt to take the bill beyond the second-reading stage, so that people will have an opportunity to understand it. We have managed so far without passing this bill, conferences from which the resoluI f honourable members tions ultimately emerged did not include representatives of the States, and I contend that the States are entitled to preserve such, relations as they like with the rest of the British Empire. .What does the Statute of Westminister seek to do? I can quoting the following remarks made by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) in 1931 :I disagree entirely with the principles underlying the motion. To attempt to crystallize Empire relations in a legal formula is an act of supreme folly. They rest upon two principles which are antagonistic-the complete autonomy of the parts, aud the unity of the whole. On a point of order, I suggest that the Abtorney General, in his haste to J introduce this bill, has adopted a most irregular and improper procedure. He has circulated copies of a monograph in connection with the bill, copies of the second-reading speech which he proposes to make, and copies of the bill itself, although .permission for its introduction has not been granted. That is highly improper. I raise a point of order on the procedure that has been adopted. -The Attorney-General is entitled to distribute copies of a monograph on any measure which he proposes to bring before the House. The circulation of copies of the bill to honourable members before leave has been granted for its introduction is certainly unusual, but it has no effect, inasmuch as it anticipates the granting of leave. I consider that any criticism of the propriety of his action is a matter for decision by honourable members rather than myself, and their decision will probably depend largely upon the motive which prompted the Attorney-General to -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Eadden) has made plain to the House that he considers the proposal to introduce this bill to be most inopportune.

220,Mr Hutchinson (Deakin) [8.18].,"some degree by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn), who said that there was more in this proposal than might meet the eye at the moment. The honourable member enlightened us by saying that the Solicitor-General, Sir George Knowles, had found extraordinary difficulty in drafting measures that are necessary at this time. As we all know, regulations have been poured out, almost in hundreds, by all government? which have held office since the war began. This point of view it new to me, and I hope that it will be explained by the Attorney-General. I am anxious to know why the chief reason for attempting to introduce the bill at this time should relate to the mere mechanics of framing measures. I regard Sir George Knowles as a most efficient and alert officer, but it is extraordinary that he should have become aware of this difficulty only in the last few weeks. I have asked honourable members who have held the offices of Prime Minister and Attorney-General whether these great difficulties of law were brought to their attention. They told me, to my astonishment, that Sir George Knowles, despite his efficiency and alertness, had not mentioned these difficulties before. It seems that they have become apparent only since the last change of government. I jhall expect to hear some sounder reasons than that before I shall agree to the introdamaging to our cause. Anything that duction of the bill. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that nothing would disturb tbe country more at this time than the introduction of a bill which, no matter how the lawyers may argue, involves the question of Empire relations. We all remember that, after the conference of 1926, a certain gentleman said that the British Empire existed in name only. In the Statute of Westminster, an attempt was .made to set down a formula for relations within the British Commonwealth of Nations. No matter what legal arguments may be intruded, the fact has emerged in this chamber to-day that t.h» great issue which will divide the people of Australia is that of our relations with other members of the British Empire. Surely, at a time when we desire the utmost unify, this measure should not be introduced. As Mr Oliver Littleton bas said, we are passing through a Mr Hutchinson. breathless period which will determine the result of this war. Vital developments may occur within the next two or three weeks. The Government has no valid reason for introducing at this time a bill which will be misunderstood everywhere and which will cause intense disseution. We have been at war for three years, but I challenge the Attorney General to cite one instance of a difficulty that has arisen, since the outbreak of war, owing to the non-adoption of the Statute of Westminster. Eveni f a difficulty should arise, a simple solution could be found. On approach to the British Government, the difficulty would vanish overnight. No good purpose can be served by the introduction of the bill, but a great disservice can be done, not only to Australia, but also to the whole Allied cause. It is most unusual to oppose a request for leave to introduce a bill in this House. I do nor propose to discuss the merits or demerits of this statute, although I have learned more about it during the last few days than I ever knew before. I am actuated by only one motive. It is evident to me that, if this bill be introduced and taken to the second-reading stage, there will occur in this House a bitter and acrimonious debate that will tend to divide the nation. That would be tends to divide us and to strengthen our enemies by creating opportunities for them to issue propaganda against us, is dangerous. For this reason, I deprecate the proposal to introduce the bill. I express no opinion upon its merits. I have heard some very sound opinions expressed by legal gentlemen in this chamber to the effect that the statute would strengthen the validity of our regulation and statute-making capacity in ordinary times. That may be so. But I take the view that any measure that will cause misunderstanding and dissention should not be introduced at this stage. The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) could do a very big thing to-night. He could either agree to take the bill to the second-reading stage and then postpone further consideration of it for some time, or he could say, "" Well the bill has waited for so long now that it can wait",46,Statute Of Westminste R Adoptionbill 1942
221,Mr Spooner (Robertson) [8.25],"a little longer"". I admit the limitalions of our statute-making capacity, but we have carried on during three years of war in spite of those disabilities. Is it not possible for us to carry on a little longer? If , by doing without this proposed law, we can keep our people united for the time being, we should do so and thus do a great service to Australia. rise not for the purpose of unnecessarily occupying time on this matter, but because I have had some association with this problem in the past. In 1937, during the regime of the Lyons Government, a bill was introduced in terms identical with those of the bill which the Attorneyhonorable members may desire to have General (Dr. Evatt) now seeks to bring down. I was the Attorney-General in that Administration, and I made a second-reading speech on that bill. I recall that I then indicated that it was the kind of measure which ought, if possible, to be passed in times of peace when no unnecessary controversy would arise in relation to it. The discussion that we have heard here to-day shows how easy it is to have the most violent disagreements about, this measure, and what has been said in this House will, of course, inevitably be echoed outside. Unfortunately, this problem seems to have an explosive in it, and, equally unfortunately from my point of view, it seems to lend itself very readily to misunderstanding. I happen to believe that the great problems of status that are inevitably raised by partisans on this matter are no longer in the field of controversy. For better or for worse-and I think it was for worse-thes e matters wei-f dealt with in 1926 and 1931, and were then disposed of. I recall to the memories of honourable members the fact that in 1931, when the 'Statute of Westminster was-, in fact, passed through the British Parliament, that passage was requested by resolution passed by both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament. Although that is a fact, it is still true that many hundreds of thousands of people in Australia believe that a bill to adopt, certain sections of the Statute of Westminster is one which gives rise, in a point fit for determination, to the quesT am sure that that will have a big intion of the status of Australia in relation fluence on the course of events in this to the other countries of the British Empire. To answer that is a task which no' member could undertake in one speech; requires a consistent impact on the public mind. The question theu arises as to how that can be brought about. Normally, I think that most honourable members would ask, "" Why have a controversy of that kind in time of war?"" But the Attorney-General says-and I refer to what he has told us in his monograph-that the reason for bringing it up at this stage is that acute practical difficulties have arisen, in effect, in the law department. That is a question of fact. It is a question on which many their minds informed. That is a matter which, if it could be established in the minds of honourable members, might remove the heat from this argument much more rapidly than anything else. Therefore, I suggest to the Prime Minister and to the Attorney-General that, if we are to blunder on into this matter, we shall have an argument which will rock this House and this country. Why should we go blundering on into the matter in that fashion? I have views on it which are not shared by all my colleagues on this, side of the House, hut that arises from the fact that, as I believe, I have had to give some special consideration to this problem in the past, and I have had to see my way clear to distinguish the problem of status, which I think has long been determined, from the immediate problem that arises from certain sections of the Statute of Westminster. I suggest that after this bill has been taken to the second-reading stage and the Attorney-General has made his speech on the motion for the second reading, a committee of members of this House, representing all parties, should at once be set up and that it should have access, not only to the Attorney-General, but also to his advisers in the law departments, so that they might have an opportunity to satisfy the minds of honourable members that there is an urgent, practical need for the bill at this-time. If they do satisfy the minds of honourable members, House. If they do not satisfy those minds, Ministers may in their turn",47,Statute Of Westminste R Adoptionbill 1942
222,Mr Menzies (Kooyong) [8,"2S] 1satisfy themselves that what is to be gained by the passing of the measure is not worth the candle, because the candle may burn into a big flame. I commend that view to the Prime Minister and to the Attorney-General. Each of them is, as I am, concerned with a practical result. I do not think that any honourable member wants an unnecessary, heated controversy at this time about matters which may turn out to be irrelevant. over 150 years the people of Australia seem to have been satisfied with the silken threads that have bound us to the Mother Country. They still feel that no hawser could be made which would bind us more tightly. The people of this country are suspicious when any legislation is proposed that might affect that silken thread. The people are entitled to know more about this measure, and it would be wise if the Attorney-General (Dir. Evatt) deferred the consideration of the bill until next year, or preferably withdrew it until victory against the enemy has been won. The truth of my statement is demonstrated by a telegram received from Perth this evening. The Western Australian branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmens Imperial League of Australia opened its annual congress at Perth yesterday, and this evening the following motion was adopted unanimously by the congress:Any attempt to adopt the Statute of Westminster or weaken the present tics that bind Australia to the Mother Country will be strenuously opposed by this branch of the league, which stands four-square for maintaining the league's policy of the maintenance of the British Empire. The telegram was signed by the president of the Perth branch, who is chairman of the congress. It may be claimed that this is an innocuous bill, but due consideration should be given to the fears expressed in this chamber that the bill will give rise to an acrimonious debate at a time when dissension in our ranks is most undesirable. Even though the measure might not be harmful, that is not the construction which the people will place upon its introduction. Therefore, the Government would be well advised to postpone its consideration until next year, or better still until after the war. ral) [8.40] -in replyI shall try to explain to honourable members the purpose bill. I did not make a speech on the measure in moving for leave to introduce it, because I thought that the usual procedure would be followed, and that I should have an opportunity to explain its proposals on the motion for the second reading. The bill does not raise the problem of constitutional status. The right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) and the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) are right, and other speakers like the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson) are hopelessly wrong. The question of status has been determined once and for all. Australia's status as a nation was made clear in 1926 in the Balfour declaration. Many people disliked that declaration and many welcomed it. This bill is not concerned with the status of the Commonwealth as a part of the Empire. It does not involve the general relations of Australia with Great Britain or with the other self-governing dominions in one iota. It deals with five narrow, difficult, technical points of legal import, and nothing else. I shall not elaborate in detail what the bill does in respect of those points. Nobody realizes better than I that it is not a simple matter to clear away for ever any doubts or suspicions that honourable members may entertain about a bill of this kind. For that reason I thought it my duty to make available to honourable members the background, the detailed facts, and the difficulties with which we are confronted with regard to our own National Security Act and the regulations made under it in order to have effective legal control of shipping in our ports. All that I set out in black and white. I ask any honourable members who have spoken this afternoon whether they have read it. per suggestion, and it should be withdrawn. have read the monograph, they have completely misunderstood it. It is difficult and tough reading, because the technical side of the law is just as unpalatable to laymen as is the technical side of many other subjects.",48,Statute Of Westminste R Adoptionbill 1942

226,Dr. Evatt,"If honourable membersI shall give an illustration of the need for this measure. A month or two ago, two Australian naval ratings on an Australian naval vessel, which had been temporarily transferred to the Royal Navy, were brought before a court martial in respect of a crime committed in the Pacific Ocean. After their trial, they were sentenced to death. By one method or another the matter finally reached the highest court, and there it was held that, for the duration of the war, because of temporary transfer of the ships to the Royal Navy, as distinct from the Royal Australian Navy, the ship and the ratings were controlled entirely by the Imperial act. have had a safeguard in our Defence Act, in respect of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, the broad effect of which is to give to the Commonwealth Government, through the Governor General, the prerogative of pardon in respect of offences committed by our troops wherever they may be. It was held by the courts that an Imperial act, which had come into operation by reason of the temporary transfer of our ships to the Royal Navy, prevented the Commonwealth Government from using its statutory power. The matter had to be dealt with by a method which was quite unusual. Ministers here had to get in touch with London, and the matter had to be determined finally there. Let mo give another illustration with regard to the Navigation Act. In June last this House and the Senate passed certain amendments of the navigation law dealing with investigations in relation to ships. Because of the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, that bill could not receive the assent of the Governor General, but had to be reserved for final determination by His Majesty the King in England. June, nearly four months agOj but the King's assent has not yet been proclaimed. urgent, the Government could have dealt with it by cable communications. trations of the difficulties that arise. Ships come under our physical control. They have to be requisitioned. If they have aliens on board, regulations have to be passed to deal with discipline. The legal backing of all the regulations dealing with shipping, is uncertain. Then there is the extra-territorial power mentioned by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender). As tlie Pacific war develops, the necessity for exercising control in relation not to discipline but to civil administration becomes more apparent. By and large the statute will remove a large number of practical difficulties which in some degree obstruct us in the Since 1910 we administration of the shipping law. been in existence during the' last three years ? vated since the outbreak of war, in consequence of which shipping has become a more difficult problem.

234,Dr. Evatt,"I do not think that itendeavoured to do more than I .believe any other Minister in my place would have done. The right honourable member for Kooyong (M-r. Menzies) has twice introduced a bill of this character. He knows that it is necessary. I appreciate his point, that it might not be desirable to pass a bill at a certain time. But I do not want legal difficulties to accumulate; I want to get r i d of them, and get on with the job. One of the restrictions on Australian legislation is the Colonial Laws Validity Act, passed in 1865. The British Parliament said to the Australian Parliament in 1931, after the latter had requested it to do so, "" Here is the power. You can .get rid of this fetter on yourself at any time you wish to do so "". That is all that is involved-a . few legal fetters; technical points; difficulties of that kind. this bill failed to pass, the difficulties mentioned by the right honourable gentleman would not be overcome? but also, asserted; and it is true. have to stop? would not have to stop. We would have to continue to pass regulations, subject always to the grave risk of their being challenged at any time in the courts. Why cannot our legislation be removed from the atmosphere of doubt? That is all that this is-legislatio n to remove doubts. I have so phrased the title of the bill that tliere may be no possibility of misunderstanding, unless it be deliberately injected into the discussions for the purpose of in j u r in g Australia and Australian representative institutions. Does anyone consider that the people of Britain will think less of us, or of our relations with them, if we pass this legislation? Ties of kinship, and the legal unity that is maintained through His Majesty the K in g, are not affected by this measure. Isi t thought that the people of Britain would resent the fact that we had removed the restriction of the Colonial Laws Validity Act? Would some one in Westminster tell some one in. Yorkshire, "" A terrible thing has happened: The Colonial Laws Validity Act, section 2, no longer applies to Australia, and the Australian Parliament can control shipping in its own waters ""? honourable gentleman believe that Goebbels would tell the world something? Goebbels would tell the world anything, unless people in this country had suggested that he should do so. I have described the legal difficulties. If desired, the bill could be postponed until the end of the war. But why should it be said, "" Y o u cannot pass it in peace-time, because it is not urgent enough, and you cannot pass it in wartime, because the emergency is too great; therefore, you will never pass it "" ? The consequence would be, that for all time there would be a legal blot on Australian legislation dealing with shipping, and a doubt whether Australia had the power given to it by it3 Constitution to legislate in respect of certain matters. The selfI s it suggested that, if governing dominions and the British Parliament all have that power. It is not only suggested, that the right honourable gentleman has outlined exist to-day, why did they not the war would exist during the last war? Of course the war would not have been possible for us to deal with a subject such as the Merchant Shipping Act. The whole point of view has changed since 1914; and the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) played a very prominent part in. securing that change, and in ensuring that the dominions had real self government in relation to their own affairs. I have given one illustration of a difficulty that has arisen because of sentence of death having been passed on two Australian, ratings. The statute law alone is to blame. death was ever pronounced by a court martial. has misunderstood me. The sentence was promulgated by a court martial established under British law, the operation of which had been attracted by reason of the fact that an Australian vessel had been temporarily transferred to the Royal Navy. The same act operated in the last war, but sentence of death was never imposed without the consent of the Australian Government.",50,Statute Of Westminste R Adoptionbill 1942

We would have to send a message to the Prime Minister of Britain, saying, "" Would you mind passing a regulation, in the name of the Ring, making this provision for Australia?"" The difficulty could probably be met in that way for the duration of the war. answer of the Prime Minister of Britain? He would say, "" You can do it for yourself. We have given you the power to do it. Do not bother us with these things "". If I have spoken forcefully, it is not because I consider that honourable members are not. justified in asking questions. But I was horrified this afternoon when I sought leave to introduce a bill to deal with certain technical legal questions, and was met with a barrage of opposition on the ground rhat what I was proposing was anti-British. I say that it is not anti-Briti?h-, that nobody can characterize either thi= proposfl or this Government as anti-British; and that, if anybody should do so, we should know how to deal with such characterization.

Apparently, the honourable member for Swan( Mr Marwick) objects to what I have done. If I have offended, I apologize. Believing that in a technical problem it would be wise to have some assistance, I arranged for two experts to be available for consultation by members of both houses of the Parliament.

If leave be granted, the first reading will be moved to-night, and the second reading to-morrow. I ask honourable members to view this proposal in the light of our determination to remove the technical difficulties that exist.

When the war is over, Australia will be confronted with the greatest task of economic rehabilitation in its history. Problems of employment, of housing, of health and child welfare, of vocational training, and of markets and price stability, will call for enterprise and statecraft of the highest order. The whole history of the Commonwealth Constitution shows that these problems cannot be solved without wider powers in the hands of the central government. In war-time the defence power I ask the right honorhas given the Commonwealth sufficient authority to handle the acute problems that arise. In the post-war world the problems will be no less acute, and no less urgent. There will be no defence powers on which to rely, and unless the Commonwealth is given sufficient power by the people the whole social and economic life of Australia will be placed in great jeopardy. Positive, quick and courageous action must be taken after the war to ensure employment and social security for all, improved health and child welfare standards, the housing of the people, and the promotion of economic stability.

261,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Attorney-Genleave any doubt about the powers of the Commonwealth to deal with them directly, or to delegate such functions as it desires to the States and local authoritakes of the past must not be repeated. ties. While delegation will often be essential, a supreme directing and responsible authority is an absolute condition of success in the attack on post-war problems. Divided authority causes hesitancy, irresponsibility and doubts. These are not the conditions under which a national plan for social security and economic advancement can be developed. A national plan requires national action. This can only be assured by granting appropriate powers to the national Parliament. In short, events have proved that the Constitution which the Australian people adopted in 1900 is flexible enough for the needs of war. But it is equally true that it is not flexible enough to serve Australia in the great task of post-war re-organization which the declared war aims of the United Nations will involve. Why is this? The defence powers of the Commonwealth are contained in a few general words, to which the courts have been able to give a suffiAustralia will be social and economic disciently wide interpretation to meet the situation of totalitarian war. .By way of contrast, the peace-time powers of the Commonwealth, though numerous and detailed, are hedged round with severe limitations. Although they were written down in the 1890's, many of the words and phrases were simply transcribed from the American Constitution of 1787. Tbe general approach belongs to the horseand-buggy age of social organization. This is especially true of the economic powers that are so vital an element in a modern industrial community. For instance, "" trade and commerce"" is so divided between the Commonwealth and the State authority that neither can deal -effectively with it. Such topics as production, employment, investment, industrial conditions, are either not committed to the national government at all, or are granted in jealous, limited, qualified and indirect terms. The Constitution of 1900 is outmoded. If the exercise of national power is reasons we should ask the people to grant necessary for war, it is equally necessary to us power to carry out the war aims and for reconstruction. Most thoughtful objects of the United Nations. It may Australians are realizing that the Constitution of 1900 is not an instrument fitted to the needs of to-morrow. Let us consider the tasks involved. The misEvery promise to the men and women of the fighting services must be honoured. The full development of the physical resources of Australia will be necessary for expanded production, increased population, full employment and social security. No policy of national development can be carried out effectively without power to control prices and invest' ment. The transfer of men and women from the fighting services and the wartime industries to suitable peace-time occupations will involve a huge programme of works and housing. The -division of powers between the Commonwealth and six States with divergent policies, will be a fatal obstacle to speedy and effective national planning. Some of the Commonwealth's war-time controls may last for a time after hostilities close; but only for a time. Without carefully considered, constitutional amendment the result in the post-war world of organization, chaos in production, mounting unemployment, widespread social insecurity-in short, anarchy. But the problem goes even deeper. This country, like all the other United Nations, has pledged itself to the task of achieving the broad objectives embodied in the Atlantic Charter and in the historic declaration of the four essential human freedoms-freedo m of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want, freedom from fear-anywher e and everywhere in the world. These declarations are not legal instruments technically binding on Australia; they are far more. They are solemn pledges of our dedication as a nation to the great ends of economic security, social justice and individual freedom. Do we intend to carry out these pledges? The answer is, ""Yes, we must"". If so, the Australian nation, which is pledged as a nation, must be endowed as a nation with legislative powers to carry out the pledges within Australia and its territories. For these be said that any elaborate discussion of constitutional changes w ill divert energy and attention from the war effort. It ' this contention were sound, it should be upheld. Buti t is unsound for two distinct reasons. First, it is becoming more and more clear that the military overthrow of our enemies, although our primary aim, will in no way be obstructed, but will be assisted if positive plans are now laid as to the course to be pursued in the post-war period. It is an im.portant part of the war effort itself that some plan of economic and social justice shall now be prepared as some guarantee to the men and women of Australia, that their sfltVacrifice will not have been in vain. I cannot sum up this better than by quoting from a recent speech of Mr John Winant, American Ambassador to Britain, who,' on the Sth June, speaking to the Durham miners, saidTo crush Fascism at its roots we must crush depression. We must solemnly resolve that in our future order we will not tolerate the economic evils which breed poverty and war. This is not something that we shelve "" for the d u r a t i o n "" ; it is part of the war. Secondly, it is plain that, if no action be taken t ill the war is over, it w ill then be too late. The problems arising on the termination of hostilities will require action as drastic and as urgent as r.h<» war itself. But the process of amending the Constitution takes some time, and a great constitutional change should never be carried out without careful consideration. We should prepare for the task now. Later may be too late. In the 42 years of the history of the Commonwealth, alterations have been submitted to the people at referendums. been accepted. for this have been advanced. that the real explanation is to be found, not in any theory, not in popular inertia or in popular ignorance, but in a fact which is so obvious that no one takes any account of it. Both in the United States of America and Australia few amendments that have been passed have been specific. They have not merely sought to give a power, but have indicated, though often in broad terms, what is, in fact, to be done. When it is proposed simply to give a power, the proDr. Evatt. posal leaves room for fear that the powers will be exercised in some way that is objectionable. The fifteen proposals for the amendment of the Commonwealth Constitution were rejected because the people could not be reasonably sure how the powers would be exercised. What is needed is to tell people more about the objects to be achieved. The Government has kept these considerations in mind in deciding the form of the present proposed amendments to the Constitution. Broadly speaking, there are four distinct methods by which the necessary changes can be made. First, it would be possible to draft a number of detailed alterations to the powers already contained in sections 51 and 52, adding some new ones and striking out limitations from some of the others. This has been the usual method hitherto. It is open, however, to the great objection that it is extremely hard for the layman, or even for the lawyer, to understand exactly what is the effect of the changes. Furthermore, in amendments of this kind, it is especially difficult to avoid a mere list of subject-matters giving no indication of the ends to be accomplished and the obligations to be assumed. The Government has, therefore, rejected this method. Secondly, it would be possible to re-write the whole Constitution on the basis, say, of the South African model. This would give to the Commonwealth a legislative power unlimited as to subject matter, leaving to the States only such powers as were assigned to them by the Commonwealth. This kind of alteration, however, is hardly the plan which can eighteen constitutional be commenced under war-time conditions. Ir is also open to precisely the same objecOnly three have tion as the first, namely that it gives no A great many reasons indication of the objects that are aimed I suggest at. Thirdly, it would be possible to re-write the division of powers on the Canadian model. This would give the residuary powers to the Commonwealth and only such powers to the States as were enumerated. This alternative is the open to just tlie same objections as the second, though, perhaps, to a lesser degree. The Government has, therefore, rejected both the second and third alternatives. Fourthly, there remains the plan of allotting to the Commonwealth Parliament a broad, but specific, power to carry into effect tbe war aims and objects of Australia as one of the United Nations, including in such aims and objects "" the attainment of economic security and social justice in the post-war world"" and post-war reconstruction generally. The fundamental feature of the proposed amendment is contained in the title. There the objective is plainly set out. It is to entrust the Commonwealth with powers to carry into effect the war aims and objects of the United Nations. The place that the attainment of economic security and social justice in the post-war world occupies among those aims is specifically mentioned. Though individual subject-matters of power are also enumerated, they are given by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. In many cases, the objective of policy is indicated in the list of particular subject-matters. Honourable members will note that this list, which will be found in sub-section 2, includes power for guaranteeing "" the four essential human freedoms"", to use President Eoosevelt's famous phrase. At all points it is made clear that what the Parliament is asking for is power to carry out in peace-time the social and economic aims that the United Nations have declared in time of war. Surely those ideals for which our fellow countrymen have fought and died are worth embodying in the fundamental law of our Constitution. It is proposed to insert the alterations, also help to lay a sure foundation for the not in Part V. of Chapter1 of the Constitution, which contains the principal existing powers of the Parliament, but in a separate part immediately following it. To inject the new powers among the old would lead to confusion. None of the limitations contained in the rest of the Constitution will apply to the powers contained in the new section 60A. No time limit is fixed for the duration of the "" war aims and reconstruction"" powers. They will, and should, remain available as long as the needs that call them into being. It is obvious that, if the amendment is accepted, the duties that will devolve on the Parliament in time of peace will be added to, and that some increase will be required in the number of members of the National Parliament. That increase, however, can be effectuated by Parliament itself without any constitutional alteration, and such a proposal should logically come up for consideration after the present amendment has been approved by the people. I should, perhaps, draw attention to one feature of these new powers that is entirely new in Australian constitutional history. It will be found in the first paragraph of the new sub-section 2 of section 60A. It is proposed that the Parliament should have power to make any law which in its own declared opinion will tend to achieve economic security and social justice, including security of employment and the provision of useful occupation for all the people. I desire to make it perfectly clear that the amendment I propose will give the decision to Parliament itself, and no person will be able to challenge the validity of Parliament's decision. For its decisions and actions Parliament will be responsible to one authority onlythe people of Australia. In moving that I have leave to introduce the bill, I have given a summary of the objects which may be achieved. The measure is not a party measure, and I hope it will not be so considered. Further, it is hoped that the States of Australia will see fit to co-operate with the Commonwealth in making a constitutional alteration which will assist the nation of to-day to prosecute the present war to a victorious conclusion and will nation of to-morrow.

The amendment would permit of a woman being appointed to the board, and the Opposition wishes to make it clear that it has no objection to the appointment of a woman. The point is, however, that the person who represents the Government in. its capacity as an employer should be some one who will view matters from the managerial point of view, and not from the point of view of the employees, whose interests are already adequately protected.

Therefore, I shall be prepared to omit from my amendment the ' word "" war "".

Minister) [9.35] -In whatever form of words honourable members have suggested their proposals they would make it impossible for the Commonwealth to appoint Miss Cashman as its representative on the Women's Employment Board. are after. is quite true that the unions could appoint Miss Cashman as their representative. It is also true that the employers could appoint a woman as their representative; but the fact is that the Government is responsible for this board, and the Government itself is entitled to a representative on it. It is also true that the Government, as a Government, is representative of all the people of Australia, half of whom are women. The primary function of the board is to decide the rates of pay for women who are being brought into industry for war purposes, according to their efficiency in relation 'to the male labour they displace. The board in all its decisions will fix for the s present the rates of pay that women shall receive for work in war industry, and in civil industry where they replace men for war purposes. This is in order that the war may be fought more vigorously by using that male labour in the fighting services, or in essential services, and, at the same time, by preventing the country from being deprived of the production which would be lost if these men were not replaced in industry.

Frankly, the Government believes that such a board, in order to be composed reasonably, ought at least to carry the guarantee that it gives representation to the sex that is most affected by its decision's. It is the responsibility of the Government to insure that the board shall be representative of women. Sir vernment can do that by insisting that at least one member of the board shall be a woman. scribes that organizations of employers or employees shall be consulted as to who shall be their respective representatives, and that such bodies shall be entitled to select the person most qualified to board was to assess the value of women's represent them. We impose no condition upon the employers, or the Australasian Council of Trade Unions which speaks for the employees in this case, as to whom they shall select. We ask them to make their own nominations; and, unless a strong reason exists for rejecting any person nominated,'he, or she, will, as a matter of fact, be appointed by the Minister to the board. The Government has a say in the appointment of two of the five members who comprise the board. The Government is, in fact, able to say who shall be the chairman, and who shall be the representative of the Commonwealth. Outside of those two choices, the choice of the employers' representatives and those of the trade unions rest with the bodies to be consulted. expect that the chairman will have regard to the interests of the Government gentleman says, in effect, that Miss and public interest, and, therefore, will Cashman should serve on the board; and in effect be the representative of the that it is the duty of the trade unions Government? ment is also an employer.

If we accept the amendment, we shall, in effect, admit that our choice of Miss Cashman was a bad choice. I am not prepared to admit that. On the contrary, I do not believe that this, or any other Government, having regard to the functions of this board, could have made a more satisfactory choice. I say that candidly.

As a matter of fact, she was a servant of a trade union, which, curiously, is one of the few great unions that has had a long experience in looking after the interests of both sexes in industry, namely, the Printing Industry Employees Union. That union has a considerable number of female members. I , myself, have been associated with them in industry; and, I know that this problem which has to be faced by the board requires-some experience of the relationships which must exist in factories between the sexes.

282,Mr Curtin,"The right honorablecan be assured that they will be represented on this board unless the Government ensures that a woman is appointed to it. gentleman suggest that the Australasian Council of Trade Unions is opposed to the appointment of a woman as its representative ? Council of Trade Unions is responsible for seeing that not only women's interests but also the interests of men are protected in industry. The major fear that organized unionism entertains concerning the employment of women in industry is that such a policy will leave a legacy of low standards in the future. Unless they are given a satisfactory contract, they resent our various plans for diluting labour, which, as they put it, endanger their standards. This Parliament under its present powers, cannot guarantee that the standards which will be reduced in the prosecution of the war will be restored when the war is over. As was explained earlier this evening, the power of this Parliament with regard to the regulation of labour is so limited that it is impossible for it to enter into formal agreements with trade unions, which would be binding upon the Commonwealth beyond the duration of the war and one year thereafter. Therefore, the Australasian Council of Trade Unions properly says that it will object to the employment of women in major industries, but will withdraw that objection if it receives an assurance that women will not be used by either the Government or private employers, to the detriment of men. I was so impressed by the complaint voiced by the right honourable member for Kooyong some time ago when he unsuccessfully moved for the disallowance of the National Security (Women's Employment) Regulations that the private employers were not represented on the Women's Employment Board that we amended the regulations in order to provide that representation. In order to balance the board we allowed the appointment of another representative of the private employees. I considered that that should meet the wishes of the Opposition. Honourable gentlemen have not criticized anything the board has done and, so far [48] as I can see, there is no widespread discontent about what it has done. If there were a vacancy on the board, I should be quite ready to accept the amendment of the right honourable member fox Kooyong, as he now proposes to move it, but there -is no vacancy. The Government has appointed Miss Cashman. She is the only representative of women, who ought to be represented. Having made its choice, the Government will stick to it to the end. Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) has shown that the Government will not accept the amendment of the right honourable member for Kooyong, (Mir. Menzies). A way out of the impasse would be for the Commonwealth to be represented by Miss Cashman, or any other person whom it chose as an advocate at sittings of the board to determine wages and conditions of women employed by the Commonwealth. It is a sound principle that there should not be any representation on the board of sectional interests. The representatives of the Australasian Council of Trades Unions represent whole sections of industry, not any particular section of industry, or any particular industry. They speak for industry as a whole. It could be argued that it is improper for 1 the Commonwealth, -as an. interested party, to be represented on the board when matters concerning it are dealt with, and that it is preferable that it be represented by an advocate. That would overcome the dilemma confronting the committee, unless it is prepared to carry the amendment moved by the right honourable member for Kooyong. The amendment of the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) would result in there being no representative of women workers on the Women's Employment Board; but the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) said that it was desirable that a woman should be on it. The only woman who could be appointed under the terms of the amendment would be a woman with managerial experience in production-in other words, an employer. AlthoughI admit that the composition of the board is anomalous and illogical, it works because its discretion is so narrowly limited by the regulations.",59,Frederick Stewart Th E Go Her To The Board She Was Appointed A

One of the representatives of employees shall be a woman. 91 The Prime Minister, in his defence of the appointment of Miss Cashman to the board, said that it was roost desirable that, having regard to the purpose for which the board was appointed, there should be a woman representative on it. He also said that, if a vacancy were caused by Miss Cashman's retirement, he would have no hesitation in considering sympathetically the proposal contained in the amendment that has just been defeated. If those two contingencies arose, the board might find itself without any woman representative at all, unless my amendment were adopted. I was surprised, as I am sure other honourable members were, to learn from the Prime Minister that one of the pre-eminent objectives of the hoard is to ensure the maintenance of the level of industrial standards for men. said that the trade unions were afraid that their standards might be lowered. Sir Surely those standards can be protected, not only by the judge, whose prerogative overrides all other considerations, but also by the fact that one of the trade union representatives may be a man. As the industrial conditions which it is contemplated are to be reviewed by the board apply entirely to women, surely it is not too much to ask that one at least of the two trade union representatives shall be a woman. Indeed, it would not be asking too much to stipulate that both shall be of that sex. -B y the decision of the committee, one member of the board is now a woman, Falstein, S.

Morgan, G. A. A. bill sets up a board, but the board is not yet appointed. preserves the existing board. sarily. ment made to the House last night, I take it to be certain that Miss Cashman will remain a member of the board. Consequently there will be on the board a representative of women workers. The board will be concerned, not entirely with the point of view and interests of women, but also with those of male workers, and of trade unions, which are continuing permanent bodies of workers. Some unions, like the Amalgamated Engineering Union, are concerned mainly with male members, because practically all their members arc men. Others, like the Printing Industry Employees Union of Australia and the Clothing Trade Union, help to hold the balance between male and female workers. Each union has a continuous personality distinct from the persons who now compose it. It is the agent of its present members and a trustee for posterity-it s future members. I The object of the unions of clothing trade and printing trade workers is to carry on organizations in which there are both interests are reconciled. The only result of the amendment would be to remove from the board Mr Wallis, whose competence has been admitted by the right honourable member for Kooyong. The only result will be that the organizations composed almost exclusively of men will have a male representative on the board, whilst those composed of women and men will be forced to choose a woman representative. We are not considering the setting up in the first instance of a board with a tabula rasa, because names have already been written on the tablet, and we know that, if the",61,Frederick Stewart Th E Go Her To The Board She Was Appointed A

299,Mr Blackburn,"Afte r the statebiU be passed, the board will be constituted as at present. First an attempt was made to remove Miss Cashman from the board, not because any one had any personal ill will towards her or distrust of her, but because the Opposition did not want her there in the capacity in which she was appointed. Now that the committee has rejected the point of view of the right honourable member for Kooyong, a new proposal is brought forward, which, if carried, will have the effect of removing Mr Wallis from the board. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) practically tells the trade unions which have men as well as women members that they must not choose a man to reprefor Kooyong( Mr Menzies) knows sent them. That might be defensible if a new board, of a different composition, had to be chosen, but it is not. cades authorities which are given the right now, because the unfair result of tbe amendment, if carried, would be to single out, for removal from the board, a man whose competence and fairness are unquestioned. The wisest course is either to reconstitute the board so as to enlarge of their representative. Honourable gentlethe representation of the parties, or to leave its constitution alone. I believe that the Australasian Council of Trade Unions and its component unions would strongly resent any suggestion of removing Mr Wallis from the board. I cannot follow the argument of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr and although 70 per cent, of the memberBlackburn). The Women's Employment Board, which is to render justice to women, protect their interests and standards, and ensure them a reasonable wage, is to be denied the right of having as one of its members a representative of women workers, other than the Government's representative. The Government's representative may not always be a woman. Miss Cashman, who will no doubt be appointed to the reconstituted board, is subject to the uncertainties of human life, as we all are, and it is not impossible that she may meet with an accident. It may happen that, at some period, the board will be constituted without a woman representative unless this amendment is agreed to.' We wish to make Bure that there will always be a woman on the board, because it has to deal predominantly with women's work. I cannot see why honourable members opposite should resist this amendment. Surely, it is not too much to ask that there shall always be one woman representative on a board of five members. Unless this proposal be accepted the board will be unbalanced. Minister for Social Services) [10.17] Honourable gentlemen opposite are forgetting a cardinal principle that should apply in these circumstances. It is that representative bodies, including trade unions, should be unfettered in making theirnomination. The right honourable member that this principle was established about twenty years ago. For nearly two destatutory right to nominate representatives to various bodies have been permitted to exercise that right freely. It would not be proper for this Parliament to direct the trade unions in the selection men opposite are surely well aware that the nominations of organizations to the International Labour Organization are not subject to government review. That is a good principle for us to observe. Mr Wallis represents nearly 50,000 workers in the clothing trades. He is the federal secretary, as well as the secretary of the Victorian branch of the organization, ship of the union consists of women, he was elected as the representative of the organization. It has nothing to do with us whether the employees nominate a man or a woman to represent them. Parliament should not dictate to them. If this amendment be carried, it will be tantamount to a direction to the Minister for Labour and National Service as to who shall represent his department. honourable members of this committee are entitled to say how a board of this description shall be constituted. majority must rule.

303,Mr Holloway,"The wish of theone representative each of the employers and the employees. It was suggested by the right honourable member for Kooyong that such a body was not well balanced and that it should include a representative of private employers. The Government accepted that principle. A board of five members was then constituted and it has operated successfully for four months. I have heard no complaints whatever about its work. This makes it all the more surprising that honourable members opposite should have felt obliged during the last two days to devote so much attention to the board. In my view, their whole procedure has been somewhat ridiculous. It would not be right for us to give a Minister power to choose the trade union representative. The workers should choose their own representative. That fundamental principle has been observed for twenty years with satisfactory results. matta) [10.20] -The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) argued that the amendment should not be agreed to, first, because it would mean the removal of one of the members of the existing board, and, secondly, because the trade unions would resent any attempt to reduce the male representation on the board. The reasons advanced by the honourable member may satisfy him, but they certainly do not satisfy me. I consider them to be quite inadequate. In any case, the board has not yet been constituted under this measure. The wages and working conditions of many thousands of women will be considered by this board and for that reason we should ensure that there will always be a woman member on it. The Minister for Social Services( Mr work that was previously performed only Holloway) attempted to draw an analogy between appointments to the International Labour Organization and appointments to this board; but the cases are not at all similar. The honourable gentleman knows that appointments to the International Labour Organization must be made in accordance with the constitution of that body. Representatives of the employers and employees must be nominated by the respective organizations. The honourable gentleman's rehonorable member suggest that women marks in that connection were not relevant are entitled, to only 20 per cent, represento this issue. The Minister for Social tation on the board? Services has declared that the trade unions would not tolerate dictation from the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) or from this Parliament regarding the selection 'of their representative. We do not suggest the name of the woman whom they should select; but I contend that Parliament has a perfect right to stipulate that of the two representatives of the employees, one shall be a woman. Nothing could be more fitting than that. In the past, Parliament has been far too reluctant to give to women their rightful place in semi-governmental activities. I cannot imagine a more fitting opportunity for correcting that omission than allow -r ing one woman to have a voice in determining the working conditions of fellow women in industry. -The honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) stated that the sole concern, of the Women's Employment Board is the determination of the wages 'and conditions of female employees in industry. I disagree with that statement. In my opinion, the sole concern of the board is the determination of the conditions upon which women shall enter industries in which only men were formerly employed. The board is concerned not only with the interests of women, but primarily with an industry in which only men were employed in the past. It will determine whether the conditions and remuneration are fair, not only to the women who enter the industry, but also to the men whom they temporarily replace. The board is concerned as much with the interests of men as with the interests of women. It will fix the remuneration for women who will do by men and for which male rates of pay were prescribed. The bill will continue the regulations governing the employment of women that were disallowed by the Senate recently. That means, I assume, that the machinery will not be interrupted. I do not expect that the Government will make new appointments and reconstitute the board.",63,Frederick Stewart Men And Women And To See That Their

Mr Wallis is a far more efficient representative of female workers in industry than any woman from the clothing trades would be. A serious injury would be done to female trade unionists if he were excluded from the board. In my opinion, no female worker would be an efficient substitute for him. She certainly would not be superior to him, and I do not think that she would be his equal. It would be bad for the board if Mr words be inserted:"" such factors as it thinks Wallis ceased to be a member. It would be bad if female workers were treated as antagonists of male workers.

Johnstone, the employers' desirable in the public interest that the payrepresentative on the board in the Ausment should operate from any earlier date."" tralian paper manufacturers' case, saidIf we have unskilled and sheltered industries agreeing to more favorable wages and conditions of employment, we arc up against the problem of how are the skilled industries going to attract and retain their skilled labour, especially as in this matter where we have women and girls receiving £5 Is. to £5 8s. a week, whilst in a number of our skilled occupations we have females, after four or more years of training receiving, under their respective awards, £3 to £3 8s. 6d. a week. The effect of this policy is so serious that I deem it my duty, as a member of the board, to stress tlie point although I realize that the board is unable to correct it as the powers of the board are definite and limited. The discontent and dissatisfaction of the skilled female at the wage discrimination is so obvious that unless some special inducement is given to the skilled employee we will have the anomalous and tragic position that it pays to be in an unskilled occupation. In fact, in the metal trades it was found that there was little, if any, difficulty in securing process workers, whilst there was definitely a shortage of skilled operatives because of certain regulations prescribing higher rates of pay for unskilled labour. I elaborated that point in detail last night, in my second-reading speech on the bill. As the board interprets its functions at present, it considers that it has insufficient discretion in considering the various matters that come before it. Whilst the effect of this amendment would be to leave productivity the dominant factor, it would be possible for promise which was given. the board to oonsider a variety of such factors when it thought proper. Minister) [10.43] -The effect of the ments which are not doing war work. amendment would be to widen the discretion of the board and allow it to decide Counter-hands are being employed in how it should exercise its discretion. I retail establishments. I am not in a propose to accept the amendment. Amendment agreed to. That regulation 12 be left out with a view "" 12. No rate of payment to be made in decision, unless in the opinion of tlie board, there are special circumstances which make it The disallowed regulation relating to this subject reads12. Any rate of payment to be made in accordance with a decision of the board in pursuance of regulation (i or regulation 7 of these regulations shall apply in respect of any female as from the commencement (whether before or after the commencement of these regulations) of work by that female or as from the 2nd March, 1942, whichever is the later, but any payment made to that female in respect of the work prior to the date of the decision of the board shall be deemed to have been received in part payment of the amount payable to the female in accordance with that decision. If it were to operate, the effect would be that on an application coming before the board, and a decision -being given, the board would make it retrospective to the 2nd March. It has been pointed out to the Opposition that in many establishments a decision is not reached for some months after the women in question have been employed. Nobody can determine in advance what the rate of pay should be. I have had brought to my notice the fact that in six factories which are making different articles for the Government for defence purposes, there would be, if the general standard rate applied, an accumulation of back pay amounting to over £40,000, all of which would represent an additional burden on the Treasury. ment would not be to take away the right of the board to award the standard rate position to argue the point dogmatically with the honourable gentleman.

Discussions that I have had with the Parliamentary Draftsman and the Prime Minister suggest that the Government could apply practically the same formula in this instance, and thus meet the point that I have raised. The reason for the language I have used in my proposed regulation is that the rather involved legal language in the present regulation is a little more difficult for the committee to understand. Minister) [10.46] -Broadly speaking, the Government accepts the general principle set out in the proposed regulation; but, if it were adopted, it would need to be re-drafted' for legal purposes. I have had an examination made of the matter, and have consulted the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt). If the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr accordance with a decision, order or interpreHolt) will accept my draft, I believe that his desire will be met, and at the same time the safeguards that the department consider are proper will be retained. have seen the draft that the right honourable gentleman has had prepared.

Minister for Social Services) [30.48] When the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) is examining this matter, I should like him to bear in mind that it is necessary to understand the background and the genesis of these operations. When women were induced to take the place of men, and the agreement of the engineers was obtained, the work was commenced without wages having been fixed. The promise was made that a board would be appointed to deal with the matter, and that whatever its decisions might be the wages fixed would be made retrospective to the 2nd March. I expect that those cases have been completed. If so, why interfere with the date? have since arisen. would not apply to those. yet been working. who have been working. not covered, but who were promised that their wages would be made retrospective to the 2nd March, will have to receive what is due to them under that promise.

The matter has been taken up with the South Australian authorities, who are not prepared to agree to the provision of sleeping cars on the overland express in any circumstances.
