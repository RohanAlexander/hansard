479,Mrs West (Bowman) (5.58 P.m.),"I wish Mr SPEAKER-Order! It being 6 p.m.,Thursday, 4 September 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7907 Thursday, 4 September 1997 Industry, Science and Technology Committee Report Debate resumed from 3 September, on motion by Mr Reid: That the House take note of the paper. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (10.01 a.m.)-I rise to discuss the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology on business conduct issues arising out of commercial dealings between firms, because I think it is of great importance to my constituents in Lindsay. It is important to put on record one quote from the beginning of this report. This quote is from a witness, whose name has been withheld, from submission No. 185. It reads: I once had a thriving business in an industry few could match my enthusiasm for ... [What the retail leases tribunal could not consider] is the devastating effect the past five traumatic years have had on me and my family, which not even our once rock solid 27 year marriage could survive. We were once confident, positive thinking go-getters but now we're broken dispirited relics of our former selves with several stress related health problems, not the least being acute depression, insomnia, nervous tension and obesity. I went through premature menopause and my once cheerful workaholic, loving partner is now an angry, aggressive alcoholic. Our children suffer too, helplessly watching both their parents fall to pieces before their eyes, and their quality of life diminish. At 50 years of age, we've been left with a massive business debt which we have insufficient earning power to repay and ... we now face the real prospect of being homeless as well. The chains have been allowed to gobble us up and the landlords allowed to trample us down. Our pleas to politicians fallon deaf ears and the legal system treats us with contempt. The end result is the tragedies exposed almost daily on the national news. Why must it be so? We are entitled to our place in the sun. [The Fair Trading inquiry] has it within its power to recommend that justice is done and if I believed in God anymore, I'd pray that you will ensure it is. That is something that I have a lot of empathy with. A lot of constituents in my electorate have been working 12-hour days, seven days a week in their own businesses and do not qualify for any welfare payments. They are actually paying tax and meeting their responsibilities in the social contract and have little to hope for in the current state of things. I wish to reassure them that this government has this in the forefront of its mind and also has a vision for how they will prosper. There are a number of issues that have been raised here. Firstly, what is the future of retail trading? I believe that the future is in the plazas. It is where I, as a young female, and possibly as a mother and certainly as an elderly female, would seek to shop. It is safe. It is secure. It is indoors. I have everything I need in the one plaza. It has some key shopping attractions, such as the large chains like Target or Grace Bros. I am assured that my car will be there; there is security. There are eating places and pleasant places to sit down while you are shopping. There is freedom from any hooliganism. It is the shopping of the future. With the massive investment required to establish that style of shopping that we as consumers all desire and demand as our living standards-especially someone as busy as I am, who enjoys shopping on a Sunday-and the investment required to go with that style of",123,Unicef And Parliamentarians For East Timor Factory Employment Falling By Some 32 Per
480,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Neh)) Took The Chair At 10.00 A.m.,"7908 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 September 1997 shopping into the future, we need to guarantee the livelihood of those who are remaining in the actual shops in those centres. It is not like strip shopping, where, if the landlord becomes unreasonable, you can move your premises across the street and, with the same name and phone number, still be in business. It does not have the same landlord competitiveness and competition, which is what our government is all about. We believe very strongly in strong competition. Small business is not afraid of strong competition and it is not asking to be protected from a tough trading environment. It simply wants a chance to survive. The committee's recommendations would give small business that opportunity. Really, you have to look at this in a holistic fashion. It is not a matter of just tweaking the edges; it is a matter of looking at where consumer spending is going in the future and how to address that vision for Australia. In particular, the committee is recommending that a uniform retail tenancy code be underpinned in the Trade Practices Act; that specific franchising legislation be enacted by the Commonwealth; and that part 4A of the Trade Practices Act be strengthened to outlaw unfair conduct. That has a number of implications, not just in the plazas of the future but certainly in franchising legislation. A number of petrol stations and petrol station operators in my area have complained to me about the invidious position that they have found themselves in with regard to someone who has a strong grip on their industry. All they are asking for is the ability to compete, for there to be strong competition and for them to be able to get ahead on their initiative. Fuel stations are the classic example. If you work very hard in your fuel station it is unlikely that you are going to earn any more than if you were a manager of one installed by one of the major petroleum outlets. Where does that leave the consumer and what is the competition for that? Do we then look at the competition in the future coming from Woolworths and being between Woolworths, BP and Shell? It is a matter of addressing those issues and the franchising issues and of seeing where we want competition in Australia and where it is coming from. With unemployment being the major issue in my electorate, I see it as addressing jobs. Currently, in petrol stations right across my electorate, they are working seven-day-a-week jobs for incredibly long hours that take them away from their families. They would be more than happy, if the profit margins allowed, to employ other people on a part-time or even a full time basis. Their standard of living would go up, the incentive for working so hard would be increased and competition would become quite fierce. Employment is the major reason. If we can see an area in which we can secure employment, then that is probably the option we should be taking. Certainly, into the future, as things unravel and employment stabilises at a socially acceptable level, then we can look at various restructuring. You always have to look at things in a holistic sense. For example, as in the tariff debate, where it is no good lowering tariffs in isolation, if you are looking at it in a holistic sense in terms of other on-costs coming down as well, then you can tweak business here, you can tweak business there and you can make a holistic environment where small business can compete in a very strong competitive environment, they can succeed, and initiative and hard work are rewarded. That is the essence of the people from my electorate, not only in the petroleum serviCe stations and the distributors, but in retail businesses in the large plazas and also in information technology. The business innovation fund has been a major step forward in that. It certainly Thursday, 4 September 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7909 is looking like it is going to shape up to be one of the major employers in the future. Certainly in my area there has been a rapid purchase of the latest technology games and gadgets that this era has given us. It is important to look at three specific issues. One is security of tenure. A person who takes out a lease, or even when they are trying to get a mortgage for a house, needs to know that his business, if it is successful and thriving, is secure in those premises and that he will not have to move again and re-outfit another premises in the short term. That is a right to renewal of leases. Another issue concerns disclosure statements. They are vital. If you are going to install a petrol station operator on one side of the road and you are aware of another petrol station or an independent operator going in on the other side of the road, then that information should be made available to your franchisee. Again, franchisees want some independence to make money on their own initiative. It is a two-way street, obviously, because major franchisees who work in a self-regulated environment, such as McDonald's, have a high standard and require a number of protections of their own in order to reach that standard. People who have a good opportunity and good ideas for franchise should be able to make money on those and not have a black box attached to their till through which major landlords, or major franchisors, can measure their gross turnover and take a percentage of takings. It certainly needs to be underpinned. The other issue was access to justice and education. This access is going to become available with things like the Internet. If we get all businesses on the Internet, we can regularly have management and business education courses to develop the skills, knowledge and ability of our small business people to take Australia into the next century. We have got a number of incentives that we can provide for small business. Some of the businesses in my area have, in fact, taken to employing people with disabilities. We get a holistic management of society where people who are on disability support pensions are now taxpayers. They come to me quite frequently complaining of how much tax they are paying and their ability to get ahead. In fact, we have with us today the members from my electorate who are nominated in the Prime Minister's award for the best employer of the year and that should be announced at 11.30 a.m. today by the Prime Minister( Mr Howard). Miss JACKIE KELLY-Thank you.

It is something that did not occur in the past 13 years of government and it was long overdue. I recommend the report to the House. and one which deserves the attention of the entire nation. It covers many varied aspects. The particular aspect that I want to focus on relates to franchisees in the petrol retail area.

482,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (10.28 A.m.),"This is indeed a most important report7910 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 September 1997 the Shell National Action Group to the honourable Prime Minister( Mr Howard). This correspondence comes from Grahame Henderson, the National Chairman of the Shell National Action Group. He says: It is my melancholy duty to confirm to you that Shell has effectively declared war on its remaining single site franchisees by drastically altering their occupancy costs to the extent that many will be insolvent by the end of the year. These latest actions are directly opposed to SheIl's written and verbally recorded assurances given to franchisees, politicians, federal and state governments and recent inquiries. These assurances related to our ability to remain for the balance of our terms, without pressure from Shell, even though their previous promises and commitments to renew our terms had been broken. He goes on to say: We are aware, and Shell have confirmed, that they intend to imminently close a portion of their retail network and the balance of the remaining businesses currently being operated by single site franchisees are immediately required to amalgamate into their company-owned networks after the demise of the franchisees. Shell's dilemma in achieving this outcome has been the existence of contractual arrangements which are in place for up to six years with their remaining single site franchisees who have not accepted the meagre offers to exit. Shell's offers have been declining rather than meeting a fair market price. In his letter of 18 July to the Treasurer, the honourable Peter Costello, SheIl's chairman, Dr Roland Williams states: The repeal of the franchise act would in no way diminish the existing contractual rights of franchisees which are embodied in their current long-term contracts. Yet, in their latest movement of the goalposts, Shell's letter of 7 July to franchisees has increased occupancy costs in the range of $1,000 to $5,000 per month for most franchisees and less than 20 days notice of this catastrophic restructure was given. Franchisees are unable to restructure mortgages and leasing arrangements, divest of personal assets or rearrange their children in education facilities at such short notice. Mr Henderson further says: If these unconscionable, and we believe illegal, acts are left unchallenged, Shell will effectively achieve their stated aim of taking complete control of their metropolitan retail network by the end of 1997, regardless of the contractual arrangements which are in place with their existing franchisees and previous written commitments given and received in good faith. This will be achieved at a profit rather than a cost to Shell when they walk in and pick up the remains of the retail businesses, after our members have been squeezed out by further economic duress, instead of receiving a fair market price to exit, or instead of continuing in the contractual franchise environment, including renewal of terms and enjoyment of the security and reward levels which they purchased at the commencement of their franchise. More insidiously, this will be at the cost of the financial and social demise of their previously necessary and dedicated franchisees, staff and families. Shell's Dr Williams' remark and others in that correspondence of 18 July can now be seen in their true disingenuous form when Shell has once again breached their franchise agreements and the Trade Practices Act and have practised blatant discrimination. Shell and the other oil majors' passionate fervour to repeal the petroleum acts is now surfacing in its true colours. It has become abundantly clear that removal at any cost of their single site franchisees is a major portion of their hidden agenda. Prudent industry analysts will no longer be fooled by the Australian Institute of Petroleum's propaganda relating to restructure of this industry and repeal of the petroleum acts. He goes on to say that the Franchising Code Council, that he was a director of prior to its demise, is no longer available to control errant franchisors in these situations, and that the Thursday, 4 September 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7911 Motor Traders Association and their affiliated bodies are attempting to assist his members with these serious and catastrophic actions by Shell. He further points out that Professor Fels will not be able to act in time to save these imminent insolvencies and that the removal of franchisees from their businesses drastically increases the concentration of retail marketing power in the hands of an overseas owned and controlled oil company which is not in the long term interests of competition for the motoring public. The members of the Shell National Action Group, the backbone of small business in Australia as well as franchisees of other oil companies, and indeed all small business people, Grahame Henderson points out, all urgently need the immediate protection as detailed in the recommendations of the recent fair trading inquiry, that is to say, Finding a balance, which we are debating now. Sadly, according to Mr Henderson, Shell have been allowing their members to enter into insolvency before these new draconian measures have been introduced. Indeed, in one case, they delayed serious buyout negotiations with another franchisee, waiting instead to negotiate with his distraught widow once his fight with cancer had ended. The letter goes on to say: Prime Minister, we beseech you to implement the fair trading inquiry recommendations to protect small businesses and cause the behavioural changes in big business necessary for fair trading in Australia. It concludes by saying: ... we implore you to convince the Shell company of Australia that their latest unconscionable actions against their contracted franchisees are simply not the way we do business in Australia. They are not just, not right, nor fair to all concerned. Franchisees should be either offered a fair and reasonable price for their businesses, or they should be allowed to remain in compliance with the original contractual arrangements under which Shell and the franchisees entered when they purchased the franchise in the first place. Our hopes and prayers for survival and an equitable solution now rest with your government. That correspondence occurred back in July; we are now in September. We have a government, which claims to support small business, doing nothing while this disaster unfolds. They have had three months to respond to the fair trading report. That is the appropriate time to respond to reports of parliamentary committees. The three months is up. They have done nothing. Not only is this situation outlined by Grahame Henderson bad for franchisees, it is also bad for the motoring public. We have had a situation just in the last couple of weeks where Shell has reduced its price support arrangements for franchisees in its desire to drive them out of business. Until recently, Shell franchisees have been receiving price support, so they can maintain a dealer margin of 3c per litre, even when they are discounting. Shell is now introducing an arrangement where the level of price support will be reduced if the franchisee discounts more than 3c per litre below Shell's wholesale price. For example, a Shell dealer who discounts 4c per litre below the wholesale price will only get a margin of 2.5c a litre, and one who discounts 5c below the wholesale price will only get a margin of 2c per litre. Certainly in Melbourne, this will just about kill off Shell petrol below 70c per litre. The service station retailers cannot afford to sell petrol for less than a 3c margin because they have to pay rent to Shell, they have to pay their staff, they have to meet all their other costs from this amount. This is simply the latest move by Shell in its campaign to get rid of its existing service station retail network in favour of multi-site franchisees whom it can control. The next step is to occur on 1 October, when profit support arrangements will be reduced. That, in turn, will send a number of franchisees to the wall. Shell's actions, taken with 7912 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 September 1997 complete disregard for the welfare of both their franchisees and the motoring public, underscore the need to implement the fair trading report presently before the House. The Howard Liberal government must strengthen the protections for franchisees, so that Shell and other oil companies cannot put them out of business by stealth in the way that they are presently aiming to do. I have to say that the government's response and body language in relation to this report are far from reassuring. Indeed, I have heard reports from the National Federation of Independent Businesses that they visited the new Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business( Mr Reith) and that they were very discouraged by his response. He referred to this report as containing isolated incidents, as being over-emotional, as having to be examined from a legal perspective. He said he would have great difficulty implementing its recommendations. I further hear that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has refused to make himself available for a very important rally on 17 September in Melbourne at the Camberwell Civic Centre organised by the United Retailers Association. available a representative. This rally is being organised by the United Retailers Association, the premier body representing retail tenants in this country, a body which is most concerned to secure the implementation of this report. This might be Minister Reith's view from his 17th floor penthouse, but it is not the view that people who are on the ground, in small business, in retail tenancies are seeing. I have got to commend the statements made by a lot of government members, both those who were involved in this committee inquiry and also those who have been speaking in this debate. But the crunch question is: is the government going to implement this report? That is the thing that we need to get from the government, and we need it now-the three months has passed. We heard from the Property Council of Australia during the parliamentary recess. They produced a report from Access Economics which purported to attack the recommendations in the House of Representatives committee report. They said, 'Well, we can't have a situation where there are, at once, both too much supply and also retail tenants being ripped off.' What this market theory that they advanced fails to take into account is the issue of plain, outright lying-all the misrepresentation to retail tenants that goes on before they enter these businesses in shopping centres and get trapped and locked into these arrangements. Over and over again we find reports of the kind of lying and misrepresentation which appear in this report, and over and over again I find in my own electorate examples of that having gone on. A woman by the name of Olga Pappas set up a deli in Sydney Road, Coburg, right outside Coles. She was told by her landlord, prior to signing the lease-the landlord is also Coles's landlord-that Coles would not set up a cafeteria in competition with her. This representation to her that she would have exclusivity was absolutely critical in her agreeing to sign that lease. What happened? As soon as she set up the deli, Coles set up a cafeteria in competition with her. Her lease contains a provision for exclusivity, but it says, 'This provision will not be binding on the lessor if their corporate identity changes.' Guess what? Their corporate identity has changed! This is the kind of conduct that lessees have to put up with.

That is not the case right across Australia, I realise, but it certainly is in some quarters. That causes a problem not just to the retailers. It goes right across the sector. It goes down to manufacturers, who are then forced to deal with one or two major players, and to producers, whether of small crops and the like or something else, because of the buying power of these large corporations. This problem is bigger than just retailers. The point I want to make here is that I do not want to differentiate between small, medium and large business. I think that the government's focus has to be on business and we should address that situation. What we have is business people being unable to compete on a level footing. I do not subscribe to the theory that we should somehow legislate to assist what is seen to be small business to advantage it over large business, or somehow take away the property owner's right to be able to deal with his tenants. WhatI am suggesting, and what this report states, is that we should be moving towards safeguards being put in place so that unconscionable conduct cannot take place. It is as simple as that. The cut and thrust of business should not be interfered with by government. We should be in a robust marketplace where the consumer is able to make decisions. At the same time, we have to be in a position whereby business people entering into arrangements are not sent to the wall because of a disagreement with a landlord. We have seen the unfair dismissal laws being based on a fair go all round. That is the principle on which they are based. That is the same principle that I would like to see applied to this report and to the issues that are raised in it. We do not want to see burdensome legislation which is going to create greater red tape and more difficulties. We want to see mechanisms in place so that when there has been conduct unbecoming by either party, that can be dealt with in a fair way without sending proprietors broke. It is difficult enough doing business in today's environment without creating greater barriers. I call on the opposition, those members who have bleated long and loud that we have not acted upon this report. Let us just state one thing. As I stated to the small business community the other day, here is the report. It is complete. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business( Mr Reith) has made a commitment to respond to it in the next couple of weeks. The political point was made that the government had said that it would do it within three months. That was the commitment it was intending to uphold. But due to factors unforeseen, that has had to be blown out by some two or three weeks. undealt with. Labor now stands up and says, 'You must deal with it and rectify it in two to three months.'

Let us get on with the game rather than making cheap political points, which is what they are going to continue to do with this report. I stand behind the thrust of the report. I believe that we must see a robust business sector. We must get away from identifying whether we are small, medium or large, for the simple reason that no two businesses are alike.

I commend this report to the House. I encourage both sides of politics to put their political opportunism aside to work towards the implementation of a fairer system for business in Australia. ( Mr Brough) does not include me in the two sides, because I am going to give a balanced view on the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology report, Finding a balance: towards fair trading in A ustralia. I point out that, notwithstanding the fact that there has been a changeover from the previous small business minister to a new one, with Mr Reith now as the minister, the government were in opposition for some 13 years and had plenty of time to be able to consult and devise policies. In fact, I was part of that process when I was a member of the coalition and I can tell you that this type of issue was debated and discussed ad nauseam. The time for action is now, in the middle of the first term of a coalition government with a record majority. Longman, before he goes, that even in the most robust of capitalist economies, the United States, there is in my view a far greater degree of protection of these interests, particularly those of franchisees and those that take on leases in shopping centres, et cetera, than can be the case in Australia. In particular, there is always that element where the people entering into these arrangements need to properly satisfy themselves, before they go into the arrangements, that they are actually going to be in a profitable business location from which they will be able to make a living and which, at the end of the day, will enable them to be able to sell or transfer their business. I congratulate the committee for its work and, in particular, I congratulate the member for Bendigo( Mr Reid), the chairman of the committee, who has done the parliament a great service in stewarding this particular report through his committee. Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia is probably one of the great landmark reports of the parliament. It is one of those reports that many people in the community look to and say, 'This is an example of how the parliament can work effectively on behalf of everyone and not just for one particular interest or political group in the community.' The findings of the report deserve the swiftest, most detailed response from the government to show that it is in fact not only listening to the committee, which it ought to do, but also taking note of the comments and the enormous amount of material that went into making this report from the various interest groups who obviously wanted to participate and have their say. The committee took considerable evidence, from all around the country, showing that small businesses were vulnerable to exploitation and abuse in retail tenancy, franchising, misuse of market power by larger competitors and small business finance. I commend the committee for its recognition that action must be taken to improve small business access to justice and to provide small business with better education and training to forestall problems arising. I am particularly pleased with their recognition of the need for general legislative protection for small businesses against unfair conduct, and with their recommendation for change to the Trade Practices Act and for more vigorous activity by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.",132,Representatives Main Committee

I might point out also to the member for7916 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 September 1997 Looking through the main recommendations, we see that the committee has first recommended the drafting of a uniform retail tenancy code by the ACCC in conjunction and cooperation with industry participants. This code would then be submitted to the Council of Australian Governments with a view to the adoption of a uniform retail tenancy legislation around Australia. Underpinning this code in the Trade Practices Act is an essential element of protecting and stimulating small business in Australia. A uniform national code with legislative protection, dispute resolution and, above all, security of tenure will be essential if the government is to restart an economy which will boost employment in Australia. We do not have to rehash the motherhood statement that small business is the engine room of employment. We know that is a fact. Unfortunately, while everybody talks about small business, it is given lip-service in many instances. Whereas the member for Longman did not want to differentiate between small, medium and large corporations or businesses, I dobecause in my view it is possible, in the framework that we have now, for large corporations to be able to manipulate the market so as to give themselves unfair advantages over the smaller and medium-sized businesses, to such an extent that they are almost entering into monopolisation of a particular market area. In my view, the great CUlprit in this is the Coles Myer group, and I might mention this a bit later. I view some of the predatory tactics of the Coles Myer group as really needing to be the subject of limitational circumscription by a more vigorous ACCC and certainly by a more vigorous ASC-because the ASC seems almost to be a lap-dog in the current context. I must admit to a degree of cynicism when I look at the time it has taken this government to get to a position where we are still only discussing a motion to 'take note' on this singularly important plank of their election commitment to small business people. I cannot help but feel the coalition is building momentum for an election campaign. It has developed its package for federal pork-barrelling of electorates, now known as the Federation Fund. The members opposite might think I am being a bit unkind, but I was amongst the coalition members who attacked the then Labor government for doing exactly the same thing, so I would feel a bit of a hypocrite if I were not to attack the coalition for merely mimicking what was considered to be one of the low points of the Hawke administrationpublic were able to see, once and for all, exactly how the funds were being administered. AllI can do is to urge them not use a whiteboard in allocating those particular funds or, for that matter, not to rely on the state premiers who are, in many instances, the worse culprits for pork-barrelling. Some of them really do scrape the pork barrel when it comes to setting the agenda for things likeMr Ted Grace interjectingtell you what, I think there are some previous Labor administrations in New South Wales that would take the cake for pork-barrelling, as he would well know-and he smiles. We will not dwell on that because there are more important fish to fry at the moment. Members of the government have had 13 years in opposition to come to some views on this-not all of you; some of you are very new, of course-but certainly the member for Fisher( Mr Slipper), who was a member before, would know that this is something that has been in the offing for a long time.

I am not being critical of the back bench. I do not think you are being taken into consideration. I think in many instances you are ignored. The ministers pat you on the head and say, 'That was a good speech,' and then promptly forget it. The problem is that the debate is being led out in the public sector. And who is the debate being led by? It is being led, in many instances, by people on the Left who were actually appointed by the previous Keating administration, who are still in jobs in statutory bodies or in government positions and who are out there, on the taxpayers' payroll, attacking the government that is employing them. I cannot understand how this situation has come to pass. The other problem, which probably will not please the two members from South Australia sitting here, is that the media, championing the darlings of the centre left of the Liberal Party and giving greater credence to those views, are distorting the mandate that the coalition was given to reform the economy of this country and to make those social reforms that are necessary to get our country working and in a situation where people can run their lives, raise their families and get government off their backs. Let me just say this to the coalition: you are going to have a big problem in the next election in saying that you are the natural party of small business, that you understand their problems and that you will fix it for them, because here you are with a milestone report in front of you and we are awaiting and anticipating a response.

I did that once and a tonne of bricks fell on me when I did it. is that, in the party room, you in the backbench have got to make a very compelling case that the recommendations in the milestone report of the member for Bendigo are adopted by this government. I am not confident that they will be. I just hope that you are in a position to force the issue. I know you mean well, you are sincere and I know that you want to see tenants enjoy a uniform retail tenancy legislation code or framework with which they can actually profit, employ people and make this country's economy better again. The difficulty when you have two parties so ideologically similar, as we have with the Liberals and Labor, is that the party who wins the election will be the one with more weapons or the best weapons.

Without it, unscrupulous traders may seriously damage the reputation of the industry sector in the eyes of the public and hurt even the most scrupulous of small business traders. An example can be seen by looking at the operators of two WA computer companies, Computer Warehouse and Jericho Computers-the latter is also in my electorate. This company is now in liquidation, with substantial debts to its creditors and a record of deceptive and improper dealings with customers. One of these customers is a part-time voluntary worker who sometimes helped in my office, a man over 70 years of age who has dedicated himself to charitable work for the Salvation Army. Computer Warehouse was reported in the West Australian on 21 May this year as having been described by the WA government's Ministry of Fair Trading as WA's worse retailer. The ministry alleged that the two companies had breached the Fair Trading Act by attempting to mislead customers into believing contracts existed to buy computers when people had simply made inquiries about them, or sought quotes. The companies then billed the people between $2,900 and $6,000 for computers. In some cases, invoices or a letter of demand came months after people had sought a quote. People were led to believe that if they did not buy, they would be sued. One charge against the company relates to coercion whereby the company threatened a customer who had refused to pay for the goods for which a quote had been sought. The man in my office was steamrolled by the company and pressured with threats of legal action that would have destroyed his ability to Jive a modest daily life on his age pension. When this matter came to my attention I investigated the facts to find, 10 and behold, that the principals of the companies were none other than a man named Gabriel Ehrenfeld and another named Marc Dale.",135,Representatives Main Committee

I am sure theThursday, 4 September 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7919 Marc Dale is the president of the Young Liberals in WA and Mr Ehrenfeld's brother, Simon, ran the ill-fated 1996 election campaign of Paul Stevenage for the Liberal Party against me in the electorate of Moore. Both have clearly established credentials in the WA Liberal Party and access, in many instances, to decision makers at the highest level in the Western Australian coalition government. I simply make these observations as a way of indicating the kind of resistance that possibly even the most fair-minded people might find in trying to implement a national retail tenancy code, or any form of regulation, to protect people in places such as the state of Western Australia. We have an instance there where people connected with the Liberal Party of WA have behaved outrageously. I make no reflection on the Liberal Party elsewhere. This is a peculiar problem in WA, as you would probably all know, and Mr Dale is a particularly unpleasant character. AndI am sure that South Australians would agree with me that the principal of this particular company has been engaged in extraordinarily outrageous conduct. When the people who make up the party which runs government can be demonstrated to be acting contrary to the interests of people, then obviously they should be removed. The problem in WA though will be perpetuated because of the nature of power-broking which characterises the Liberal Party in WA. People whose votes are needed to keep one particular faction or another in ascendancy will be tolerated doing almost anything as long as they vote the right way in the state council meetings. This report has the potential to help small business and it is a milestone report. The honourable member for Bendigo will go down in the annals of parliamentary history as being the steward responsible for this magnificent document, the blueprint for the coalition winning government again with the support of small business. At the moment the coalition does not enjoy that support. Small businesses are feeling extremely jaundiced about their prospects under a coalition government and in many instances they feel betrayed because they were promised a great deal. Unfortunately, after 1Y2 years of coalition government they are still saddled with enormous amounts of red tape. They were promised 50 per cent reductionthe first term of government and, in fact, they have actually had more thrust on them. AllI can do is urge fair-minded coalition members of the coalition back bench not to let their ministers get away with this. They should speak up strongly and with a common purpose to ensure that these recommendations are adopted by their government. We anticipate them with bated breath. Ms JEANES (Kingston) (11.06 a.m.)-The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia is of immense significance to the future of this nation.

They were promised a 50 per cent reduction in red tape by the end of7920 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 September 1997 In seeking to address the imbalance that has emerged in this country between the big guy and the little guy in the retail sector, it offers us an opportunity to reflect on the wider Australian society, on the way in which Australians have perceived themselves over the past 209 years and on the way we choose to perceive ourselves into the next millennium. There is undoubtedly a major imbalance in the power relationship between the small retailer-who has often placed the family home on the line by mortgaging it, borrowing excessive sums of money and going into the retail business-and the major conglomerates who become their suppliers, competitors and landlords. The negotiations that take place to secure an agreement might be compared to the negotiations that David would be forced to undergo with Goliath if he did not have a slingshot to achieve the victory. The major companies might do well to consider that Goliath in fact may have survived had he been willing to negotiate. Perhaps the government's response to the report should simply be to issue slingshots to small retailers. But killing off the big guys is not the answer of course at any time. We simply need a more equitable playing field and we need to restore the balance. For the modem day retail Goliaths, there are plenty of Davids ready to do business in search of their financial independence. Inability to find work, the need to be mistress or master of one's own destiny or perhaps a misguided search for prosperity, an investment of a voluntary separation package and plain old masochism are among the factors that lead to the decision by many Australian Davids to establish their own small business. Figures from the last retail census in 1991-92 show that 80,230 did so in the retail sector. The Australian nation has been built by ordinary hard working people, willing to pull up their sleeves and get down and just do it. The people who built this nation did so with the great optimism and confidence that they were building a future for themselves and their families. In building their own futures, they were in fact building a nation. They were wool growers , merchants, explorers, surveyors, goldminers and innkeepers. The people who built this country rolled up their sleeves and, at times in the face of severe adversity, just did it. It is a similar spirit, which, in the latter part of the 20th century, inspired usA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.11 a.m. to 11.32 a.m. part of the 20th century, inspires people to throw themselves into their own businesses. It is most timely that this report has been produced when the federal government is seeking to address what has become, over the past 15 years or so, one of Australia's major diseases, unemployment. Small retailers not only provide goods and services to customers; they are also intensi ve employers. The Australian Bureau of Statistics provides information on the number of people employed per $1 million of turnover. An examination of the categories where small retailers tend to dominate the market, such as bakeries, shows that in 1991-92 there were 25.6 people employed per $1 million of turnover. In hairdressing and beauty salons there were 39.8 people employed. Pity help the hairdressers and Australia's unemployment rate if someone invents an automated hair cutting, colouring and perming technology! Comparing these figures with categories where large retailers tend to dominate the market, such as supermarkets, the figures show that only 6.9 people are employed per $1 million of turnover.",137,Representatives Main Committee
517,Ms Jeanes,"Before the division I was saying that it is a similar spirit which, in the latterThursday, 4 September 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7921 Whilst these figures may be open to some interpretation, they do suggest strongly that employment is more intensive in the smaller retailing sector and that, for every $1 turnover transferred to the large retailing sector, jobs are lost. This is something that must be foremost in our minds as we respond to the fair trading inquiry report. What should we do to protect the smaller retailer to ensure that they get a fair go, that there is some equity in the power relationship between them and the owner of the premises they need to rent and their multinational competitor? One of the problem areas for small retailers is in the negotiations .vith landlords. The major conglomerates pour vast investment dollars into their centres, and they do not do it in order to receive a minimal return. Whilst these large centres provide customers with a great diversity of choice and the comfort of weatherproof shopping, little thought is given to what the customers are missing out on due to the vast social changes that have occurred in changes to retail shopping. The large centres have wiped out many of the smaller shopping centres and shopping strips. In my electorate, the small retailers outside the large centres have struggled to compete. The small retailers in the large centres have also struggled against the power of the large corporations who own the centres and occupy much of the larger areas of retail space within the shopping centres. There are many factors contributing to the problems facing Australians today, and changes to retailing can obviously not be blamed in isolation. But it is interesting to reflect on the loss of the role of the comer shop and its proprietor from neighbourhoods, and the consequent loss of contact with proprietors and neighbours. Undoubtedly, large regional centres have affected change in social patterns and have contributed to the isolation suffered by many people in contemporary Australia. Small retailers not only provide goods, services and employment; in a small way they help fill the void left by the change in retail and other social and economic patterns. The hairdresser, the deli owner, the bakery, the newsagent and the snack bar all provide a role in communicating with their customers. My small retailing constituents provide me with many examples of customers who have come to rely on that contact. In fact, one of my newsagents, upon whom many of my elderly constituents have come to rely for their papers, cards and conversation, helped me campaign to receive postal services in Morphett Vale after the closure of the post office. He has such a good relationship with so many of his isolated customers-elderly people who could not walk the two kilometres up to the new post office-it helped me convince Australia Post of their plight, and we got extra postal services at his newsagency. The committee's report identified four areas where small businesses were vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. These are retail tenancy, franchising, the misuse of market power by large competitors and small business finance. The chapter on retail tenancy contains a number of horror stories. No-one in this place should be left with the impression that these are just a few horror stories that happened to find their way into the court. I hear similar stories from small retailers in my electorate and from other major shopping centres all around South Australia. Clearly, the states have not provided adequate protection to the small retailer. The committee made 12 recommendations to address the issues presented to them, which it described as plugging the gaps in retail tenancy legislation around Australia. One of the recommendations addressed the proliferation of shopping centres. There were suggestions that social and economic impact statements be lodged with development applications. This is 7922 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 September 1997 perhaps one of the more innovative but obvious recommendations and one which I fully support. Surely it is healthy to examine the impact of large scale investment and determine if it will contribute to the decline of other small businesses in the region and the loss of long term employment. The report also addressed the issue of franchising. Franchising, it seems, can work anywhere between very well and very poorly. Concerns about problems in franchising resulted in the establishment of the franchising code of practice in 1993. Once again, the report recognises difficulties emanating from the inequalities in the power relationship between the little guy, the franchisee, and the big guy, the franchisor. The committee made three recommendations on franchising. These were: the enactment of franchising legislation; compulsory registration of franchisors; and compliance with codes of practice. From the correspondence I have received, these are desperately needed by the franchisees. One of the other areas where the small retailers suffer at the hands of the big guys is dealt with in chapter 4 of the report, 'the misuse of market power'. The chapter covered issues such as price discrimination, where evidence was given to the committee showing that supermarket chains were selling products considerably cheaper than the wholesale price available to small retailers, and predatory pricing, where the large retailers undercut the small guys to eventually force them out of business. Section 46 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 is supposed to provide the protection that small retailers need against these practices, but it has been unremarkable in providing such protection. The committee has recommended amendments to the Trade Practices Act and a greater role for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to curtail the misuse of market power. Prior to last year's election, I met many small business people in my electorate who told me that one of their biggest hurdles was gaining access to finance. The response of the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) to the Wallis inquiry into banking is designed to produce a more efficient and cost effective financial system through improved competition which will widen access to finance for small businesses. The committee has made five recommendations on this matter which will focus exclusively on the treatment of small business by our financial institutions, with particular attention to the security small businesses are forced to offer if they want the finance. One of my favourite liberal political philosophers, as I said in my first speech to the House, is Leonard Trelawney Hobhouse, because he was passionate about tackling inequality. Hobhouse saw an active role for government in levelling the playing field to protect the less powerful from the more powerful long before such terminology was ever used. Indeed, he saw it as the obligation of government to do so because, in a democracy, the elected government has an obligation to maximise freedom for all its citizens. At times, this requires government to limit the freedom of the more powerful in order to enhance the freedom of the less powerful. Given the beneficial contribution of small retailers to the Australian economy and social fabric, the government should do nothing less in responding to the report. I have great confidence that the report's recommendations will implement in a practical way the good old Australian expectation of a fair go for all, an expectation that this country was built on and an expectation that encourages Australians to give it a go. We will not survive and prosper as a nation and we will not provide jobs to Australians who want them if the little guys do not continue to give it a go. I do not think I want to live in a country where there are no more little guys. I commend the report and its recommendations to the House. Thursday, 4 September 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7923 repairers in my electorate of Herbert, based on Townsville and Thuringowa, have certainly expressed their concerns to me about issues relating to fair trading. I am very fortunate that the member for Bendigo( Mr Reid), author of the report Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia, came to Townsville to address a public meeting on the issue, at which a lot of concerns were raised by people from Townsville and Thuringowa in relation to fair trading. It is incumbent on this government to respond to this particular report in a fair way, because there is an expectation out there. But it is also important not to give an expectation that the government can deliver on everything. It is very important that what we do should be there and should not suffer challenge from the High Court at some later stage. I am very supportive of the Reid report and people in Townsville and Thuringowa are also certainly very supportive of issues in relation to fair trading. of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, which is chaired by my colleague and friend the member for Bendigo( Mr Reid). Their report, Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia, is a very thorough and comprehensive study of the issues relating to fair trading in Australia. The committee was asked to report on the issues which arise out of commercial dealings, particularly in the area of franchising and retail tenancy. The committee was further asked to recommend ways in which these issues could be addressed, whether by government intervention or by industry self-regulation and voluntary codes of conduct. The need to minimise the regulatory burden on business was an important element in the committee's tenns of reference. The importance of small business to the Australian economy cannot be overestimated. This was the truth that was conveniently overlooked by the previous Labor government, which preferred to do deals with its big business mates. Since coming to office, the Howard government has initiated many reforms which will help small business to survive and, hopefully, to grow. Changes to fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax, reduction in red tape, simplification of government forms, and abolition of the job destroying unfair dismissal laws are but a few of the major achievements of this government in the area of small business policy. These measures have been welcomed by many in small business, but they also tell me, and I can see, that more needs to be done. As I visit the many small business proprietors in my electorate of Makin, I learn first-hand of the experiences and difficulties that many of them face on a daily basis. One of their chief concerns would have to be their relationship with big business. This is not a recent phenomenon, but one that has been around for many years. In Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia, the committee concluded that many of the concerns felt by small businesses were justified and needed urgent attention. My own observations allow me to support this conclusion. When introducing the Trade Practice Amendment Bill in 1976, the Prime Minister( Mr Howard), then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, stated that 'free and fair competition is a basic tenet of a free enterprise economy'. Unfortunately, the relationship between big and small business is, too often, not 'free and fair'. In investigating the various issues relevant to its terms of reference, the committee received evidence which showed unfair",138,Representatives Main Committee

519,Mrs Draper (Makin) (11.41 A.m.),"I wish to begin by paying tribute to the members7924 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 September 1997 practices in a number of areas-in particular, between retail tenants and their landlords and between franchisors and franchisees, as well as in the misuse of market power by large firms competing with small businesses and in the harsh conduct by banks and other financial institutions towards their small business clients. One of the major concerns is that, in many instances, small business is presented with a deal on a take it or leave it basis and does not have the financial resources to challenge the heavyhandedness of big business. The committee has recommended in its report that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission be more active in promoting compliance with the proposed new unfair conduct provisions to the Trade Practices Act 1974. Within Makin there are several shopping malls, including Tea Tree Plaza which will soon become the second largest shopping centre in South Australia. The development of the shopping malls has increased Job opportunities for many constituents in Makin and I am naturally very pleased to see that the developers and shop owners have enough confidence in our economy and in my home state to embark on new business ventures. Unfortunately, the downside for some small business retailers has been in their relationship with their landlord. Complaints about retail tenancy accounted for the majority of the submissions received by the committee and more than half of the evidence given at public hearings. Retail tenants have genuine and legitimate concerns and I am pleased that this was recognised by members of the committee. I have spoken with small business proprietors in Makin who tell me of the stress they are under from the lack of security of tenure for their business. They feel that they are left in a helpless situation, particularly when they may be trying to sell their business close to the date of the expiry of their lease. Relations between many of these small business proprietors and their landlords are further exacerbated by the lack of clear information given by the landlord during lease negotiations and by the reviewing of rent during the term of lease. Many small business proprietors who have been trading successfully for years have experienced these problems. Miss Soula George, from South Australia, gave evidence as a representative of the Micro Business Consultative Group. She told the committee: I have been in smail business, mainly in the retailing of food, which is the fastest growing sector in the industry, for approximately 20 years. Seventeen of these years have been in a major regional shopping centre. Consequently, I have witnessed first-hand the changes within the industry. I have also seen the deterioration of business relations between landlords, managers and their tenants to such an extent that the malpractice has led to our industry being in crisis. I am very pleased with the response of the committee to these problems. Its recommendation for the drafting of a uniform retail tenancy code by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in consultation with industry participants is a sound and fair response to the evidence it has acquired during its investigation of fair trade in Australia. I certainly would support the adoption of this recommendation and look forward to the drafting of such a national code. The committee further recommended that the uniform retail tenancy code provide for minimum lease terms of five years, with the option of lease renewal for a further five-year term. Tenants would also have a right of first refusal of the lease for subsequent five-year periods. The report goes on to recommend further measures for inclusion in the uniform retail tenancy code which would redress the imbalance which currently exists between retail tenants and their Thursday, 4 September 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7925 landlords. Included in these recommendations, I am pleased to say, is that the market review of rent only be permitted on renewal of a lease. If adopted, I believe the uniform retail tenancy code would establish dealings between retail tenant and landlord on a fair and even ground. This measure needs to be adopted and implemented as soon as possible to ensure a sustainable future for many small businesses. I recently had the pleasure of meeting Mr Richard Flashman, Executive Director of the Motor Trade Association of South Australia. He and two other representatives involved with the issue of multi-site franchising in the oil industry spoke to me about the problems associated with the operation of a service station. I am pleased to see that these concerns have also been heard by the members of the committee and that recommendations were made in this report. The move by Shell and Mobil to multi-site franchising has caused great difficulties for many service station operators. Multi-site franchising reduces competition by allowing the oil companies to control the price of oil in a particular area, whereas before, when the owner operators owned the oil in the tanks beneath their service station, there was the ability for the operators to set their own prices accordingly and compete with other service station operators. This is not the case in a multi-site franchise situation where the oil company owns the oil in the tanks and sets the prices. Service station operators have little real choice other than to accept that which is offered to them by the oil companies or leave their business. They have very little bargaining power. This gives the oil companies great power over individual businesses; the cards are definitely stacked in their favour. The committee heard the concerns, such as the fact that there will be no payment of goodwill on the termination of an agreement between the oil company and the service station operator; that there is an inability on the part of the service station operator to negotiate a price at which products are supplied, with the oil companies dictating price; and that the majority of any liability has been shifted to the service station operator. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware of the joint statement issued by the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology ( Mr Moore) on 11 December 1996 in which it was suggested that the government may remove the Petroleum Retail Marketing Site Act and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act when the oil companies, the distributors and service station operators, have reached agreement on the new oil code and appropriate code of conduct. I would have to say that from my investigations into these issues such agreement is still a long way off. I certainly believe that the oil code needs to be strengthened in favour of the small business proprietor before these two pieces of legislation are repealed. The committee has noted the regulatory action taken in the United States in relation to this issue within that country and I express the opinion that something approaching that measure may be needed to be adopted here. I have cited two of the main areas of dispute between small and big business covered by this report. These two issues I know to be of relevance to many small business proprietors in my Makin electorate. On their behalf I speak in favour of the adoption of the recommendations made by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. If implemented, I believe that the recommendations will redress the imbalance and bring about greater fairness and equity in the business dealings between big and small business. 7926 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 September 1997 We all want to see more jobs created in Australia so that our people will be able to work and provide for themselves and their families. The jobs will be created in the small business sector of our economy. Big business is purchasing high technology equipment which will lead to fewer, not more, jobs in that sector. Only small business will be the provider and creator of real jobs. As a member of the Howard government, I applaud the measures that have already been taken to help small business. This report provides us with further information about the real difficulties being experienced by small business proprietors around Australia. Finding a balance is the title of the report. It is now up to us to ensure that a fair balance is achieved between the big and small business sectors. Debate (on motion by Mr Ted Grace) adjourned. Family and Community Affairs Committee Report Debate resumed from 27 August, on motion by Mr Slipper: That the House take note of the paper. Mr O'KEEFE (Burke) 01.53 a.m.)-I would just like to take a couple of minutes to commend the committee on the work that it has done so far as reflected in the summary report into aspects of youth suicide. I have taken a particular interest in this inquiry for two reasons. Firstly, I was the first chair of this committee and I have always thought that it has chosen some pretty substantial topics, some very hard personal and social topics to deal with over time. The members of the committee who have been actively working on this particular inquiry will have come across many family situations that are both distressing and difficult to come to grips with. SoI commend them for the work and the report to date. Secondly, I also had a particular interest because at one unfortunate time in the late 1980s in Kyneton where my office is in the electorate of Burke, the town was identified as Australia's worse location for youth suicide. At that time there were a number of unfortunate occasions when young people took their lives and, statistically, Kyneton topped the poll for a period of time. That led to a significant amount of money being spent on some research into that area by both the former federal Labor government and the Victorian state government at the time. But, I have to say that I do not think it took us very far because many of the questions are so difficult to answer. Then, as other areas suddenly became listed at the top of the poll, of course the attention moved elsewhere. The first recommendations of the committee should be carried through, and I would urge the government and the minister to adopt those findings. At the first seminar, I was pleased at the extent of interest of federal MPs-at the number who attended and the presentations. I was quite taken by Professor Baume's presentation, which is in the report. One of his points was that the drug problem that we talk so much about in our community concerns illicit drugs, but that the drug problem at the heart of the youth suicide problem was primarily alcohol and some other forms of legally prescribed drugs. That gave the committee a fairly sombre note to work on. There is a popular notion that young people get themselves into trouble, for whatever reason, with illicit drugs, but the dominant drug that is prevalent in the medical research that analyses drug deaths is alcohol, Thursday, 4 September 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7927 and that is a legally available drug. So society's defence against this has to be tempered by this knowledge and by understanding the best way to go about dealing with it. I particularly draw attention to recommendation No.3, which is rated priority 3. I think it deserves a higher rating than 3. I call on the government and the minister to give priority to all of these recommendations. The third recommendation comes to the heart of this. In nearly all situations, the people who commented-family members and so on-might have noticed some depression. They might not even have been aware of any symptoms. It is very clear that a lot of us do not know what depression is, nor can we recognise it in ourselves or others. When it happens, it seems to be a fairly normal thing; we just seem to be going through a bad time. The recommendation places great focus on putting information in areas where young people go to read and find out things, including the Internet. That recommendation gives a very clear emphasis to the fact that, whatever the circumstances, we might get depressed. If we understand what is happening and what can flow from this, maybe we can put in the defence mechanisms to help not only young people but everybody face this depression. I recount one situation that I have experienced. A close friend of mine took his life a week or so after talking to me. We were standing outside his house and he said to me, 'Neil, I've got five television sets in this house.' He said, 'What sort of a family is it that needs five TV sets.' I did not recognise that he was asking me: 'Where have I failed? How has this happened that my family is so uncommunicative?' I did not recognise that. Of course, he was obviously entering a severe stage of depression that led to him taking his life. AllI can say is that it is a hugely difficult task that the committee is trying to tackle. Members of the committee will have COme in contact with some very difficult and moving situations on which they are trying to make policy sense and in circumstances where often it is impossible to make sense. Despite this, I commend the members of the committee for the work they have done, and the report that they have brought forward is a firm starting base for a national response to this problem. I had some involvement during our last term of office with the national road safety strategy and it hit me at the seminar that we had either just a few more or almost as many young people taking their lives through suicide as were being killed in car accidents. We are taking many steps in various ways to try and overcome the problem of young drivers being killed in car accidents and since youth suicides are of the same magnitude, that too warrants a national response to the issue. That is what the committee is trying to come to grips with. I urge the government and the minister to take account of these recommendations. They are a very good platform from which to launch a response, but I would urge whoever is working with this to give particular attention to priority 3, the depression awareness campaign, and particularly to the use of the Internet. We must make people aware that this can happen to them, that this is how it happens, that here is how they respond to it and all the ancillary offshoots of that, including training and recognition. I commend the committee for its work and recommend to the government that it adopts these recommendations. Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs entitled Aspects of youth suicide. This report was the result of a one-day seminar held here in Parliament House",141,Representatives Main Committee
520,Mrs Vale (Hughes) (12.03 P.m.),"I speak in support of the report from the House of7928 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 September 1997 which was attended by members and senators from across the political spectrum and which involved many people from the broader Australian community. We all came together to focus on this serious social problem, united in our desire to tum the tide on this tragic conundrum which concerns the whole nation. It is a conundrum because in so many ways to so many people, our great Australian nation is the land of milk and honey. To many of us it is indeed the lucky country, the land of opportunity, the land where fortune truly favours the brave. We all know so many vibrant young people who have tremendous enthusiasm for life and who have an irrepressible optimism for the future. Therefore, it is incomprehensible to many of us that we also have those young people who feel so isolated from the happy thrust of life, who feel alienated within their own communities, and who experience such a deadly loss of hope. We are mournfuIly aware that we have the fourth highest suicide rate amongst our 15to 24-year-old males in the industrialised world. In 1995, the most recent year for which data is available, one-quarter of the total deaths of young males in our target age bracket were attributed to suicide. However, as the report warns us, these deaths can be seen as just the tip of the iceberg because there are about 10 times as many hospital admissions for suicide attempts. Alarmingly, there are about 35 times the number of suicide attempts by young females. These figures have struck alarm beIls across the lucky country. We are faced with the tragic reality that there are many young Australians who are so desperately unhappy that they cannot bear to continue to live in our world. Professor Robert Kosky, director of psychiatry at the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital, put the question which taxes the hearts and minds of the nation: why do our young people kiIl themselves? The most vexing aspect of this tragic question is that there is not one clearly identifiable cause for suicide. It was shown to be a multifactoral phenomenon and hence demands a multifaceted approach for solutions. Professor Kosky'S research showed that young people move into a dangerous situation when they experience emotional depression at the same time as chronic family discord. In effect, these young people feel that they are unloved, unwanted and worthless. How much of this is an unfortunate by-product of our modem high-tech society and its accompanied stress is a matter of anecdote and conjecture, but there are many of us who instinctively appreciate that the thrust of modem living leaves many of us bereft of the necessary time to nurture those special relationships in our lives. It seems to me that modem society is marked by an impoverishment of time, and yet many are unaware of how this impacts upon the quality and nature of the relationships which forge the inner worlds of the hearts and minds of our children. There are two significant aspects suggested by Professor Kosky which are instructive in that they produce in the hearts of a depressed young person a sense of isolation which appears to be the one common identifiable factor manifested in each and every victim. It is instructive to consider one of the graphs presented by Dr James Harrison, Director of the National Injuries Surveillance Unit at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, which showed a marked decline in the previous suicide rate during World War II. While he did say that there were many complex reasons for this, there are influences within communities in times of perceived common threat which we, again, instinctively understand. Thursday, 4 September 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7929 We are aware that there is a deeper sense of community spirit, a sense of being needed, a powerful instinct to stand together in our country's darkest hour, a personal feeling of sharing in a great effort, of belonging, of having a real social purpose. One aspect of suicide then, leaving aside those cases of the mentally ill, is a deadly crisis in one's emotional life. It is the lack of any perception by a vulnerable person of any sense of feeling valued or feeling needed or feeling worthwhile. This does not necessarily mean that such a person is not loved or not needed or not worthwhile but that they do not perceive that they are. When such a perception is coupled with a problem in their lives which they are unable to solve because of poor problem solving skills, or they are unable to share because of poor communication links, they find themselves alone, isolated and hopeless, and in terrible danger. We all know how to create a loving and loved, well-adjusted adult human being. It takes a loving and nurturing environment which allows the infant human being to grow in selfesteem and self-confidence, secure in the knowledge of who they are and where they fit within their families and within their neighbourhood. It is the natural consequence of growing up in a loving family network. I do not assume to define a family because they are like rainbowsthey come in many colours. But, within a nurturing family, a strong sense of belonging and contented happiness grows within the self of the infant from the first days of its life. Babies just do not survive without love, affection and care. In my electorate of Hughes one of our church groups carried out a survey on the feelings of local young people in an attempt to find out how to assist them. To the question, 'Do you consider that you live in a loving, caring home environment?' an unexpected 67 per cent said, 'No.' I am sure their parents would be shocked because these children come from solid, middle-class families where hard working mums and dads are endeavouring to provide the benefits of life for their offspring, and whose love for their children is their singular reason for working so hard. The problem is that the children do not perceive the strength and security of this love, and this signals to me that we have some very serious problems in the way and effectiveness by which we communicate the strength of our love to our children. One leading consultant child psychiatrist told me that he believed human beings need at least four seven-second hugs a day. Hugs say a lot, especially in the uncertain world of the adolescent. Hugs actually say, wordlessly but very powerfully, 'I value you.' Loving hugs are the greatest expression of emotional reinforcement and personal affirmation that we can give our children: they cost nothing but time. But teenagers are not cute and cuddly and it seems very few receive hugs. Often a self-held perception of lack of love and self-esteem leads a young person into alcohol and substance abuse because a lack of love means a lack of understanding, which helps create the sense of isolation, which leaves a void within the heart which fills with pain. At the seminar, Professor Kosky raised the issue of feelings as a very important aspect of youth suicide. He said: Suicide is more than just a feeling. You may feel hopeless and have this terrible feeling that things are not going well and that maybe there is no hope, but the thoughts that come to you about wanting to kill yourself because you cannot deal with these factors are also critically important. He then said: If these thoughts turn into the action of self destruction, they become a possible tragedy. So we should not separate feelings but should look at issues in a more holistic fashion ... in terms of thoughts, feelings and actions. 7930 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 September 1997 There are countless events which could tum those thoughts into actiqns of self-destruction. There is one which I would like to draw to the notice of the House, and that is the undocumented impact of dark, negative and violent lyrics heard in some of the heavy metal type music which is on the market and which is listened to by our children. Let me refer to an article in Family Forum of April 1997 entitled 'Pop music and the death of culture'. It states: Modern music has made some very radical changes in the past few decades. In 1953 the number one song was 'How much is that doggie in the window?' and ten years later the Beatles were singing 'I wanna hold your hand'. Things quickly declined thereafter, however. Songs by the Rolling Stones such as 'Lets spend the night together' led to more graphic ones. One album entitled Her satanic majesty's request contained songs like 'Sympathy for the devil'. Occult and satanic things proliferated as bands like Black Sabbath and Kiss burst onto the scene. Today gangsta rap features themes of rape and violence, well oiled with a torrent of profanity. One rap album used the 'F' word 293 times. Bad language is often more than matched by bad themes. One album by Ice-T called Body count features songs about killing cops and raping women. Death metal groups like Cannibal Corpse, Nine Inch Nails and Slayer dish up grisly tales of violence and death. Consider a few titles from Cannibal Corpse's albums called Crucifixion and Anti-Christ Superstar. Manson, an ordained minister in Anton Levy's Church of Satan delights in promoting murder, suicide and hatred of religion. Band members wear a T-shirt saying, 'Kill your parents'. Consider a few lines from various songs in Anti-Christ Superstar, which reads, 'You can kill yourself now because you are dead in my mind.' These songs of nihilism and hate are certainly a far cry from the kind of popular music of few decades ago. Professor Kosky's warning of the danger of thoughts turning into action can all too easily tum into an icy reality. There is a tow truck driver in my area who has had the terrible job of collecting motor vehicles which have been used by young male suicide victims. On one occasion he reported back to his boss, a personal friend of mine, that when he pressed the button on the cassette deck, out blasted at full volume heavy metal type music with messages of death and hate. He also went on to say that this was not the first time he found this kind of death music in such motor vehicles. It is difficult to believe that there is not a connection. Suicide is a complex and deadly confluence of circumstance and negative thoughts in the life of a young person. When it is understood, as research shows, that children listen to music over 30 per cent of the waking hours, the danger of negative and destructive thoughts turning into tragic action gets closer to becoming a tragic reality. Such violent, hateful, nihilist and doom laden music is freely available for our children to hear. Added to alcohol and drug abuse, it is a deadly cocktail. It is worth observing that illicit drugs appeared in any quantity on the Australian scene in the early 1960s, as did the beginnings of violent and hateful messages of death and destruction in our children's music. It was about this time that our suicide rate began to climb tragically. I strongly urge our government to seriously and urgently investigate the lack of effective regulation in the music industry. This will at least protect our young people from one source of destructive negativity and hate. It is up to us to continue to research this complex issue and take positive action when we do find a situation which demands our attention. As the elected members of parliament, we are the only Australians who can act to stem the importation of such music for the protection of our young people. To do nothing would be a gross abdication of our responsibility to those young Australians who, because of other circumstances in their lives, are vulnerable and are at risk that their negative thoughts turning into the action of selfThursday, 4 September 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7931 destruction as illustrated by Professor Kosky. I strongly commend the recommendations of this report to the House. Mr SA WFORD (Port Adelaide) (12.12 p.m.)-Other than acknowledging and recognising the importance of the aspects of youth suicide summary report as further beginning a process in this country to address the appalling statistics of youth suicide, I found the report somewhat disappointing. Let me qualify that. I am appreciative of the fact that the seminar was just one day and that for personal reasons, I was unable to be there. Be that as it may, my disappointment is that only one major point, out of at least the four that are required, was identified and that was the national inquiry. For me, it simply reinforced the view I have held for many years now that, when children are concerned, this parliament is as ignorant as most other influential groups in this country. I will provide evidence to support that perhaps unpopular and minority contention a little later in my speech. I do not intend to be perceived as deliberately provocative. This issue is far too important for that. I simply believe that the direction indicated by the seminar does not go far enough. No-one is the fount of all wisdom, and I am no exception, yet I do not believe I am wrong and I am yet to be convinced that is the case. The summary report correctly indicated that the rates of suicide per 100,000 of population show that, since the 1960s, the rate of young male suicide has almost trebled and the rate of young female suicide has doubled. The report also indicated that, for young males between 1979 and 1995, there has been a fivefold increase in deaths from hanging. The report also acknowledged the multitude of complexities that impact upon the circumstances that lead to youth suicide. But what it did not do was explain and identify the circumstances happening in this country affecting children and adolescents in the 1960s, the 1970s and the 1980s. The report stated that, for young males in Australia between 1979 and 1995, there had been a fivefold increase in deaths arising from hanging. The question that needs to be asked is: what circumstances in this country during this period changed that may have directly or indirectly contributed to feelings of depression, isolation and so on? In 1979, I was a principal of a primary school in Adelaide with about 900 students. I mark this particular year very clearly because in South Australia this was the beginning of the severe decline in the value South Australian society placed on the care and education of children, particularly young children. I soon became very aware that this was not just a South Australian problem. It was· an Australian problem, an English speaking world problem and, finally, a developed world problem. There is a given, in my view, in the care and education of children, that is steadily but ever increasingly being devalued in Australia and elsewhere in the world. That given is as follows: that between the ages of seven and 11, the quality of schooling is the most significant determinant of the future success of an individual. It is more important than gender, socioeconomic status, ethnic background or religion, which compared to quality schooling have received far greater priority than they deserve. The London Educational Authority after a four-year longitudinal study, one of the few ever done with children in primary schools, concluded exactly this in 1986. But state governments throughout Australia have ignored that given for the past 20 years. The age group five to 15 are the forgotten people in Australian society. The allocation of resources to this group that actually goes to supporting young people on the ground has seriously deteriorated over the last 20 years. 7932 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 September 1997 Some will point to increases in funding. But I tell you, precious little of that funding went to kids themselves. The year 1979 saw the beginning of a 'Primary means first' campaign in South Australia to increase resource allocation to primary schools. It failed. In the early 1980s, another campaign entitled 'Into the nineties' commenced and received overwhelming support from schools and parents. Similar campaigns occurred in Tasmania. That campaign and the individuals who drove it, a group of 12 primary principals, was white-anted and discredited by no less than the education bureaucracy and the Secondary Principals Association, who, like some powerful individuals in the teachers union, TAFE and university, saw it as a threat to their favourite resource allocation and fought it tooth and nail. However, this campaign had some success in that the bureaucracy was forced to announce a primary review. Schools, however, are still waiting 10 years on for any substantive implementation of those recommendations. The important point I make here is that advocacy for young people five to 12 disappeared. The separate bureaucracies for early childhood and primary education were dissolved. Individual after individual at a senior level who argued for a fair go for primary aged school kids was given redundancy, retirement or simply chose another occupation. Advocacy for young people aged five to 12 was gone. Can anyone in this house point to a group in Australia that effectively represents the needs of children aged five to 12? There is none. That is a major problem that needs to be addressed. It requires national leadership that up to the present time has gone missing. At the national level, it requires a ministry for children and youth affairs, a point made to this parliament several years ago by the member for La Trobe( Mr Charles) and myself. I have already stated that educational leadership went missing. Political leadership has gone missing too, but it is even more widespread than that. The churches ignored the needs of young children. They were more concerned with dwindling membership, widespread child abuse which was coming to public attention at an alarming rate and looking after their particular sectoral interests. Mainstream structural and resource problems were just overlooked. The unions ignored the needs of young children. Like the churches, they were too preoccupied with dwindling membership, as well as union amalgamations and rightly preserving the jobs of their members. They did not see children five to 12 in their ballpark of interest. The welfare sector forgot the link between the mainstream young and the special groups of adolescents and young adults they tried to represent. The needs of the very young were just ignored. The business sector, which had seldom shown any interest in the very young, simply continued their merry blind way on to what was going on all round them. The women's movement made us all aware of the legitimate needs of women. It failed miserably in recognising the needs of children aged five to 12. Ethnic and indigenous leaders, to the best of my knowledge, made little or no attempt to represent the five to 12 age cohort of children. Their commitment was on other fundamental and, for them, crucial issues. The green movement forgot about the needs of young people, even though these same young people greatly assisted their propaganda. The list of non-concern goes on. I state this not to slam these groups, most of whom were involved, in a period of great change, in fundamental and crucial issues highly important in our time. I simply point to the reality that, in addressing fundamental issues of change, there was no time and no energy for kids. Thursday, 4 September 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7933 In the 1980s, we saw a phenomenal growth in child care, recognising the increasing need for women to enter the work force. Instead of calling it parent respite, which it is, we called it child care. NowI defy anyone in this house to say that the rationale for this was the care of children; it was not. The rationale was to allow parents the opportunity to work and there is nothing intrinsically wrong with that. It makes good economic sense. Whether it makes good social sense for children is somewhat debatable. But again, to take the year 1979 as a starting point, other phenomena were occurring in this country. Unemployment was beginning to become chronic and endemic, and settling around a 10 per cent figure to which orthodox economics could do and would do nothing. As unemployment became entrenched and youth unemployment soared to around 40 per cent and higher in rural and regional Australia, another phenomenon was taking place. As people were getting out of work, overtime in this country soared to 20 million hours a year. That is the equivalent of 500,000 forty-hour a week jobs, from 1978. Note the time scale. For the 150 years prior to 1979, working hours in the English-speaking world decreased and decreased, yet in 1979, for the first time, the graph for working hours goes the other way. Overtime for males increased by 80 per cent and for females there was a 100 per cent increase. At exactly the same time, effective resources for primary schools were being reduced. Parent opportunities to be with their children were also greatly reduced. As more and more parents placed children in child care, parents became less involved in school and community activities, tired by long working hours, depressed by job insecurity. The other group in our community, teachers, who spend as much time with children, were being demoralised by what was occurring in primary education. Children were becoming more and more isolated. The two groups they relied on so heavily, parents and teachers, became preoccupied with their own very real problems. Marriage breakdowns, drug and alcohol abuse, violence and all the other negative issues of today's society all contribute to the isolation of children. Let us not forget the media's role in this. A Sydney study a few years ago recognised that up to 96 per cent of the print media's depiction of our children was negative, and theprecious little-positive depiction of children is not too flash either: pretty young girls, handsome young boys, presenting mostly non-achievable roles for other young people. Cute, but of no substance whatsoever. Yet we are confronted with an ever-increasing crisis with young people in Australian society. All of us are being shown as being quite impotent in dealing with the problem. Young people do not just commit suicide. It is a culmination of years of neglect, wrong diagnosis, wrong emphasis, wrong solutions, and lack of political will and community will, that makes particular young people just end it all. The report correctly identified the dearth of data concerning young people. This is another indication of neglect and wrong emphasis. I have addressed thus far a failure in relationships with children by parents, teachers and interest groups in Australia, including government, and also the failure of an effective advocacy group for children in the age group five to 12. I would like to continue that theme of failure to relate to young people as it impacts on the age group 15 to 19. Rightly or wrongly, we all describe each other by occupation. Young people are no different. Yet dramatic change has impacted upon the opportunities to get a job. The teenage labour market has collapsed. Technology, especially in financial institutions, has removed entry level jobs for young people. Downsizing, outsizing and outsourcing, in both the public and the private sector, have removed entry level jobs for young children, young people. It is short-sighted policy but it is reality. Young people are more adversely affected by those changes than any other group. 7934 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 September 1997 When young people are in the transition from 15 to 19 years of age, three institutions have a large impact upon them-schools, training providers, in which I include universities, and employers, both private and public. Do schools have a strong relationship with training providers and business or government? Do training providers have a strong relationship with schools and business or government? Does business or government have a strong relationship with schools or training providers? We all know what the answer is. It is a resounding no. The three groups in the real world have no real knowledge of each other. The dialogue that does occur between these three groups is noted for its infrequency and for the predictability that each one of the institutions will denigrate the other two. That is not particularly helpful to young people. One has only to talk to young people themselves who have sent off numerous applications for jobs, only to be rejected, to know the distress that causes. Government, business, training providers and schools can no longer operate in isolation from each other and expect young people to survive and this country to have a positive future. Children and young people need consistency-it is a basic human need. It is my experience with children that, whether their parents relate to them strictly-spare the rod and spoil the child-whether it is by family consensus or whether it is completely laissez-faire, the child is always well adjusted when the message they receive from their parents and teachers is totally consistent and is communicated to the child. It is inconsistency and lack of communication that destroys children's modes of behaviour. It is no different if these children see the same inconsistencies coming from schools, training providers, business or government. The report acknowledges that fatal trauma of young people is higher than the quoted figures. What surprises me is that the figures are not substantially higher, given what young people have been exposed to in our society over the last 20 years. The setting up of a national inquiry will assist the database so sadly and irresponsibly missing. But this tragedy of youth suicide needs much more than that. In brief, three other matters need to be addressed. One is advocacy, one is resources and one is effective communication between groups that have an impact on children and youth. Firstly, the advocacy issue could be begun by the setting up of a ministry of children's and youth affairs at the national level and taking seriously not just youth suicide but all the problems confronting youth and children. We have never done this in this country. Secondly, the resources issue could begin to be effectively addressed again by national leadership, placing much needed accountability on state governments for the negligence-and village hall mentality on many occasions-regarding children's and youth affairs, particularly the issue of resource allocations that actually find their way into the school to benefit children. Thirdly, all groups seeking funding from government would have one other criterion added to that agenda of ethnicity, the disabled, and so on. That criterion should be children and youth. What are they doing? In conclusion, I wish to acknowledge the important work of the standing committee in making a further beginning on this tragic issue. Clearly, I am perhaps on a different wavelength to most-whether that is the correct wavelength, perhaps only time will tell. I thank members for their attention. the member for Port Adelaide( Mr Sawford), and share his concerns about youth. I also wish to highlight what I consider the critical element missing today for young people between the",145,Representatives Main Committee
521,Mrs West (Bowman) (12.28 P.m.),"I commend the comments of the previous speaker,Thursday, 4 September 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7935 ages of five to 12 and 15 to 19. I see this essentially as a time factor. Parents are no longer willing to spend the time with their youngsters. The opportunity for child care is readily available. But the genuine need for nurturing is still there for the children to share their ideas, for parents to be there to listen, and for children to have the opportunity to talk and to have taken seriously what their place and space is. I met some young people at the recent youth forum conducted in Canberra and it was interesting that these 18and 19-year-olds identified the need for parenting courses as a necessity for parents to have a mature approach to raising children. This is something that I feel we need to identify. Coming out of the mouths of babes, as one of a more mature age would suggest, is the identification of the flaws in perhaps their relationships with their own parents or the flaws they can see in other people's relationships. This is one of the critical pieces of information that has been received relating to this report on youth suicide. The identifiable causes, or the conditions that preceded a suicide, were often the lack of time-or the lack of effort-given by parents towards recognising the child's cry for help. I am pleased today to have the opportunity to speak to the report, Aspects of youth suicide, although its contents are very disturbing. Before talking about the issues contained within the report, I would like to congratulate the committee secretariat and my fellow committee members for the work that they have put into this document. This report should shock all Australians. Suicide, particularly where it concerns our youth, is a subject many would prefer not to talk about. It is a distressing issue and one which, all too often, gets pushed aside: it is put in the too-hard basket. But we are forced to face the realities of life at this time. Youth suicide is a reality. No-one in this house could deny that the current rate of youth suicide in Australia is unacceptably high. If just one person took their own life per year, that rate would be too high. We live in stressful times. There appears to be more pressure on our young to succeed, both at school and in the workplace. There are also more social demands on the youth of today, and the recent concerns over heroin trials and the easy availability of drugs within our community are ringing alarm bells for each and every one of us. The problem is coming closer every day, Mr Deputy Speaker. There is probably someone within your own personal experience who has either attempted to commit-or has succeeded in committing-suicide, who has had available to them drugs or illegal substances, including alcohol and other abuse substances. There are other options for our young, but these are not highlighted as much as the negative aspects of suicide and drug abuse are. Governments need all the help they can. They need advice, realistic advice. They need first hand knowledge from people who have experienced these critical times in life and survived. It is the survivors who can mentor and assist others in the crisis that they are facing at this particular time. Quite frankly, what we found was that youth did not have anywhere to go. Often the peers knew of a child's attempt, and the uncanny disappointment, frustration or depression that was the critical factor, in many cases, that led to suicide. The report goes some way to addressing the needs of our young. It pinpoints the major factors that influence our young and suggests ways in which this and succeeding governments should deal with the problem. I am pleased to say that there are helpful associations out there. Community groups are willing to link and network and assist in the prevention of suicide. 7936 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 September 1997 The Minister for Family Services( Mrs Moylan) recently launched the Lifeline Australia youth suicide prevention project. This service, which has received $3 million in funding, will extend the range and availability of telephone counselling services to youth. Youth need to share their concerns with someone who is easily contactable. If parents, carers, family members or peers are not there, that telephone link is essential. There are other measures and programs being introduced, totalling $31 million over the next three years. They include $6 million to the states and territories to improve access to counselling services in rural and remote areas, because this was where the need was seen to be critical, as more youth suicides occur in rural and remote areas. There will be $3 million to provide programs for parents-and I really feel that is probably not enough. Parents are everywhere, and they need to be able to access those facilities when they are facing troubled times, depression and financial concerns. So that they do not need to tum to drug or substances to ease the pain, they need friendly advice and assistance. There is $2 million for education and training of health professionals. Recognising the symptoms of depression is critical. If a child presents itself to a GP, which is not always the case because they are usually accompanied by a parent, they may not be willing to express their innermost feelings and the doctor may not be able to identify depression as the cause. However, other health professionals and counsellors in schools should be able to pick up those critical points where a child is suffering, and suffering in silence. There is $1 million for research into childhood mental health and factors which lead to adolescent suicide and attempted suicide. While young adolescent males are the most successful at youth suicide, it is disturbing to find that young girls attempt suicide at a much higher rate. This cry for help needs to be identified and assistance needs to be there at that time. On top of that funding, there is $19 million for the national youth suicide strategy. This includes the Here for Life program initiated by the former administration. The work and activities of that program have created a very positive community support network in areas where it is established. I am aware of one that is being established and is working very well in the Logan area. The networking of community workers is coordinated through the Royal Australian Society of General Practitioners. It has made significant progress towards bridging the gap between informed and trusted GPs and local youth so they can access and communicate with them through their personal interests. There is the opportunity for GPs to go in and talk about current issues. Where young people might not be able to talk about it with their parents if they are not there, they have the time allocated during their school routine to talk about critical issues. They might sound silly-I remember being asked for questions when I was at school and we had to write them down so as to remain anonymous. Quite frankly, some of the answers we got from our adults, who were not GPs, trivialised or did not really listen to our concerns. But I am assured that this program is critically listening and answering the needs of those youth in that situation. I am hopeful that the benefits and expertise of this program can be transferred and translated into my electorate through the Redlands Youth Network. The network has built up a strong support base for many young people in need of help in the area. They have introduced a wide range of programs to assist these people. The group also runs activities, particularly during school holiday periods, to give the youth something constructive to do with their time and not Thursday, 4 September 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7937 give them time to get into trouble. The Redlands Youth Network has the full support of the local council and I have supported their activities in the past. This government will continue to support such groups. In an effort to overcome the problems confronting our youth, we will endeavour to proceed and succeed. However, it is one thing for these programs to be set up. What we as federal members need to be doing is telling our constituents and health professionals what is available. All the money in the world is no good to the 18-year-old in my electorate, or in other electorates around the country, who has been cut off and isolated from society. How is he to know what programs the government has put into place? Who he can call? Where he can call? He or she is too busy searching through the bins at the back of Woolworths trying to find a feed for the night. I was given an offer recently by my local ambulance drivers to join them one night on a tour of the electorate so that I could see what they see. I will be taking them up on the offer, but I can say that what I have already heard about the homeless youth in my local retail shopping centre is disturbing. Having realised this was a major concern, I have met with the Wynnum and Redlands Youth Suicide Prevention Committee and Bayside Adolescent Boarding Incorporated. These groups, along with the Redlands Health Service Centre and the referral and assessment program, or RAP, are working towards achieving positive solutions for youth in my electorate of Bowman. This group came to me with a list of proposals including better promotion for telephone counselling services, an infocard for all youth in the area, a resource kit for teachers and youth workers and, most importantly, consultation with youth to help them help themselves. This report has gone to many groups in my community in Bowman and we are looking forward to facilitating programs and encouraging the youth to access the services that are provided. The youth of this country are our nation's future. We need to look after them. We need to help them the way we were helped as we grew up. We must remember that the pressures of today's world are in many cases greater than they were for us as teens. We must be sympathetic to their problems, not judgmental. I congratulate the committee, I was pleased to be part of this inquiry and I commend this report to the House. Ms ELLIS (Namadgi) (12.41 p.m.)-I also was part of this House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs and participated in the seminar on youth suicide. I was very pleased to speak at the time of the tabling of the report and am equally pleased to have the opportunity to further add to the discussion today. The benefit for me in coming back into the debate at this point of time is the time that I have had since the issuing of that report to hold discussions, both formally and informally, with a range of people throughout my community on the subject of youth suicide. That is not to say that that had not been spoken of before, but the report has really jolted a lot of people into concentrating on it more and thinking more deeply about what we should, in fact, be trying to do to address this problem. As a member of this committee, I took advantage of getting in excess of 100 copies of that report and I sent copies to a very broad range of people within my electorate. I asked them to look at it, read it, and come back to me with comments. And the comments have been very interesting and useful. 7938 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 September 1997 There is absolutely no doubt that youth suicide is a serious concern for all of us, not only as parliamentarians, as members of particular political parties, but also as members of our community. Our community, holistically, collectively, has to start to address this problem as seriously as possible. However, we have got to keep the issue in perspective and face up to it with a certain degree of reality. We have also got to admit that it is not unique to this country. In fact, only last weekend or so I read in one of the weekend newspapers a very large article about the very issue we are talking of. It was a newspaper from Bangkok-the main daily major up therethat a friend had given me to read over the weekend. The very subject of youth suicide was being talked about there, and there was a very large article in the paper about how their society is coming to grips with it and what sorts of things they are starting to consider to address the issue. So when we are talking about youth suicide, we need not necessarily get carried away with the Australianism of it, but focus on the problem itself. It certainly knows no borders in terms of ethnic or social bordering and it crosses over a range of people within our community. There is no doubt that the suggestions coming forth in the committee's paper are important and I, along with probably every member of the House, am sincerely looking forward to government action on them. However, I believe that we also need to start looking further into the question of suicide amongst our young and start asking some of the more difficult questions. I think that these relate to the sorts of pressures that are faced by young people today in our society. Have we, as a community, actually thought about how we value our young people? Do we value them enough? Do we value them fairly? Do we put blame on them for difficulties that they may be facing today which are not necessarily of their making at all but are of the making of our generation and generations before us? I am using the word 'blame' in a fairly light fashion. I am not saying that we stand there and throw it at them, but are we inferring it in some of our actions? We are facing the severe and heart breaking problem as a nation of unemployment. This issue is not being dealt with by our nation collectively. I believe it is the country's biggest issue, and one of the most difficult to solve. Should we be blaming our young people if they cannot find employment? Is that what we are doing? I am being very bipartisan in these comments. In some of our actions as a government, as parliamentarians, as business people, as leaders within our community, are we really imputing blame to our young people that is not theirs? Are we considering the impact of those decisions? The pace of change in today's world is already frightening enough to many of us along the road of life. From our point of view, some of our polling in past years has indicated a particular fear, a hesitation or a lack of understanding in the community of the pace of life and the pace of change. A lot of people, both young and old, have difficulty in dealing with that and in keeping up with it. To sound a bit prophetic, when a young person starts out on that road of life, how do we know how these people feel about actually jumping on to that spinning disc of life? Are we actually giving them enough credit to understand the difficulties that they are facing in sorting out their lives in front of them? The age when youth suicide unfortunately occurs is when these decisions have to be faced by these very young people. How on earth can we support them at that time in their lives, given the pace of that spin? Is it their fault that they have trouble in working out where they fit? I sometimes sit and Thursday, 4 September 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7939 wonder how difficult it must be. How often have we all said, 'I wouldn't be young again for all the tea in China, given the difficulties in our world today.' When we talk about youth suicide, we really need to have this broad view about it: what is it and why is it? As a society, another issue that concerns me is our speed to judge. Only a few short years ago-probably in the last three to four years-within my own community, we had an unfortunate period when people were quick to judge groups of young people congregating in the community. There was almost hysteria in the local press at the time so that, if you were not a young person and you saw a group of them in the street, you actually walked around them and avoided them. They were to be feared because they were congregating, loitering-all of these new modem words. Yet what did we do when we were their age? We congregated and we loitered, for want of better terms. I can remember doing it many times on train stations. In today's age of technical advancement, young people spend a lot of time on their own, or with a very small number of people, in front of computer screens or video games and other technology. When on earth are they going to learn to socialise? We have to promote that; we should not condemn them. As a society, we need to sit back and ask whether we are correct in judging in the way that we sometimes do. It is very important to allocate dollars to the question of youth suicide. But as important as that is: what role do those other factors play? Are we giving due credit to considering those other things? Are we sufficiently addressing mental illness amongst the young? I do not believe that we are. In fact, if I hear one more time any government of any colour say, 'We can't afford to do that', I will despair. There are certain things that we simply must afford to do. We cannot let our young people down, nor any part of our community for that matter, when we talk about 'need of home'. Homelessness cannot be addressed without spending money. Mental illness cannot be cured, assisted or supported without spending money. This is an undoubtable fact. While we create buckets of goodwill in terms of money towards youth suicide-which I do not for one moment denigrate-that on its own is not going to achieve a thing, if at the same time we have mentally ill, homeless young people roaming the streets with no support and no hope for their future. Without this holistic approach, we are really cheating our young people and putting ourselves under a delusion. Youth suicide knows no boundary, social or economic. You can have a youth successfully suicide from one of what we would judge to be the best or the worse of families, depending on how you make that judgment. You can have youths successfully suicide whether they go to church every weekend or whether they do not. You can have youths successfully suicide whether or not they have been in the child-care system or whether or not they have had a parent home at 5 o'clock every day. We have to get away from the categorisation of blame. We have to look at all of the underlying reasons why pressures upon our young people are driving them to this terrible choice. One of the things that frustrated me as a member of this committee, and I have said this before and I will say it again, is that whilst there is a lot of data around, it is not comprehensive. It is not good enough to tell me, as a parliamentarian and a decision maker, hopefully, that young men in rural areas succeed in suicide more than others-without telling me why, and we do not know why. Nobody has told me whether the young men in rural areas committing suicide are doing it because their parents' farm has been repossessed, or because they are homosexual and terrified to tell anybody, or because their girlfriend has walked out 7940 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 4 September 1997 on them. All we know is, and I am being terribly general here, that young rural men suicide successfully more often. The other thing that we need to consider carefully is the fact that 60 per cent of those who succeed in suicide have attempted it before. If we know that, why are we letting that 60 per cent group do it successfully the second, third, fourth or fifth time? What is wrong with the counselling service? What is wrong with the follow up? What is wrong with the collation of data around that individual? Just after this report was tabled I had a lady from my electorate come to see me. This is a family with a lot of socioeconomic problems, a lot of pressures on the single parent. She had had two daughters. The elder daughter succeeded in suicide a few short years ago. The younger daughter, a month or two before the mother came to see me, had also attempted suicide, but had not succeeded. A mad, frantic phone call to the authorities had someone visit her that day to intervene immediately, but the follow-up counselling was 3V2 weeks later. That is just not good enough. In a lot of cases, in 3V2 weeks time a young person may not remember why they did it. Who knows the understandings of a confused young mind? I am not being critical of government when I say that. We have to demand that resources be put where they are required, and I do not think it is good enough for a family in that situation to be forced to wait that period of time. There should be an automatic scooping up of that family, and they should understand immediately that whatever support is required around them is there. The mother was as much in trauma as the daughter. The mother got no assistance, and none was offered. I am sure that this is not a unique situation; I am sure that it happens in many electorates around the country. If we are going to be sincere about this then I really think we need to start making these sorts of demands. Another reaction that has come to me from my community has been the need to demystify youth suicide because in some ways we are too scared to talk about it. If we talk about it too much we might put it up as a pretty good option. The people who have been talking to meparents, members of the clergy, young people-have all said we need to get down to tintacks here. If youth depression is a problem then we need to understand how to recognise it and how to deal with it. As a result of those discussions, I am organising a forum on Friday of next week and Professor Kosky, who was one of the experts who came to our committee, has agreed to come over from Adelaide for this two-hour seminar. I am getting up to 200 people to come to this forum. In fact, we are going to have to close the door. The reason why I am doing this is because the community demands that I give them an opportunity to hear a clinician, in very non-clinician terms, say what it is we are talking about when we talk about youth suicide. I have a lot of faith in this seminar because everyone can come-youth workers, parents, teachers, the clergy, young people, scoutmasters or whoever. The reason for this is that I think these people need to be able to sit down at that level, hear the expert, discuss it with him, and amongst themselves, and go out, I believe, better armed, better informed and more confident in understanding what they are dealing with. This forum is only a very small thing that I can do. The bottom line for me in this whole subject is the consistency we require in approaching the subject. The Here for Life program did a lot of good. The current government's program is going to do a lot of good. But while young people remain homeless, suffering mental illness, unemployed, lacking direction in their future, lacking Thursday, 4 September 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7941 security and knowing where they are going and why, all of those dollars will only have half value. My message to this parliament is that we all should do what we can to make sure that all of those issues are addressed, right across the board, and not isolate youth suicide as some unique part of social policy. It is the result of a lacking in all of those major areas of policy generally. Debate (on motion by Mr Vaile) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 12.57 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Convention Against Torture and Other (I) I am advised by the Human Rights and Equal Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Opportunity Commission that the total direct cost Treatment or Punishment to date of the Inquiry was $1.541m.
