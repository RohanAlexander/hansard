M . A . S . Sydney off the Cocos Islands, which, for greater accuracy, I shall read. HMAS. SYDNEY. About noon on Monday, 9th November, a telegram was received at Navy Office from Cocos Island stating that a three-funnelled warship had arrived off the island and was landing a party of men in boats. Communication with Cocos immediately ceased. It was realized at Navy Office that this must be the Emden, and efforts were at once made to get into touch with Sydney, then believed to be in the vicinity of Cocos islands. An urgent telegram was despatched to the Perth Radio Station, forwarding a code telegram, to be made on the highest power of which this station is capable, with the . "" en clair"" preamble, "" Very urgent! do not reply."" followed by the Sydney's call sign and the telegram informing her of the Emden's presence at Cocos Island. No further information was received until 4 p.m. on Tuesday, 10th inst., when the Eastern Extension Company brought to Navy Office a retelegram received from Cocos that the Sydney was engaging Emden, and that Emden was a wreck on the north of Keeling Island. This news was confirmed half-an-hour later by a telegram received by the Naval Board from the Naval Commander-in-Chief on the China Station, stating that the cable from Perth to Cocos was out of order, but that the one between Cocos and Batavia was still working. He reported that on the night before Cocos Station had managed to send a short message on extemporized instruments that Emden had been engaged by a British cruiser, but that the result was not yet known, and that the German landing party had seized the schooner and left the island. The Commanderin-Chief stated that later information had been received from Cocos that Sydney had arrived there and that Emden was wrecked on the north coast of the island. He added that he was informing Admiralty. A more complete account was received on the morning of Wednesday, 11th. It was then ascertained from Cocos by a telegram forwarded by the courtesy of Mr Webster, Adelaide representative of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, that Cocos had temporarily restored communication, and was able to supply further particulars. It appears that Emden arrived at In pursuance of 6 a.m. and sent three boats with a landing party, consisting of three officers and forty men, with four maxims. The island immediately sent out an urgent wireless call for help, which was received by Sydney just before the installation was smashed by the Germans. The landing party had apparently just completed their work of destruction, and actually put off to the ship, when the Sydney hove in sight. The Emden at once put to sea, leaving her boats behind. On clearing the island the Emden apparently opened the action on the Sydney, and it is stated that her shooting was at first excellent, but after she had been under fire from the Sydney her shooting fell off considerably. It is gathered that Sydney must have poured an accurate and deadly fire into Emden, as the latter very soon lost two funnels and a mast, whilst the whole of the after part of the ship was on fire. The action lasted an hour, the Emden being then apparently in a sinking condition and completely on fire. It is as follows: The captain evidently decided to beach the ship, as she is reported to be wrecked on the north of the island. The Sydney received very slight damage, the casualties consisting of three killed and fifteen wounded. The names have not yet been reported. After Emden was beached Sydney picked up the doctor of Cocos Island and his assistants and proceeded to the help of the Emden. The result of this visit is not yet known. The German landing party seized two months' provisions and made off in the schooner Ayesha. The manager of Cocos Island station reported",5,Governor General S Speech Presentati On Of Address

In addition to these statements, we have 1 received from all quarters telegrams of congratulation. mention the following' From the Secretary of State for' the Colonies. "" Please convey to your Government my hearty congratulations, complete success achieved by HMAS. Sydneym putting an end to the career of the Emden.""

' "" Australians in Fiji congratulate Commonwealth first naval victory."" There is a host of other telegrams from within Australia and from ' individuals outside the Commonwealth, hut I do not think I need trouble the House with them. I have only to add that I do not think there is a soul in Australia but feels very-happy indeed that such an opportunity arose, and such a success has followed the first serious naval action by our own ships. Minister think that some should be communicated to the operators of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company for their alertness in sending, before their equipment was smashed, the message that resulted in tfie of the German cruiser Emden? done so well, I refrained from specially naming any individual or individuals. am sure that the people of Australia, while having pride for the victory gained by the Sydney over the Emden, are sorry indeed that the success was not attained without,, at least, three casualties by death and fifteen by wounds. pleased at the event, we sorrow for the sufferers and mourn. the killed; but nevertheless these are the consequences of war. ..Undoubtedly, the Government are grateful for the alertness and capacity shown by the officers at Cocos; and, acting on the suggestion . of the honourable member for Perth:, we shall take suitable action to convey to the parties concerned the feelings expressed in this House. MrJ . H . CATTS I should like to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether it is a fact, as reported in the i Sydney press, that the stevedoring of prize vessels has been let by contract to a German firm; if so, will the Minister Amongst them.

I understand that was the arrangement made by our predecessors, and that procedure has been followed by the present Government.

NEW statement appearing in both Melbourne papers this morning to the effect that the Premier of New South Wales is placing on the Adelaide market Treasury Bills at the rate of 5 per cent, for an amount of £2,000,000. Is the Prime Minister aware of that fact, other than from his reading of the newspapers, and does he consider it to be a breach of the agreement arrived at at the late Premiers' Conference, by which agreement any State was precluded from borrowing other than for renewals ? aware of borrowing of any kind whatever by any of the States. I have handed to the Leader of the Opposition a copy of the agreement entered into between the States and the Commonwealth at the recent Conference, by which agreement the Commonwealth finds the money and the States borrow from the Commonwealth under certain conditions. If these conditions are not complied with, the Commonwealth is on its part under no obligation to comply with the agreement.

The hours these girls worked were reduced while Mr Austin Chapman was Postmaster-General, and they have remained the same for six years, though Those are the inI understand that there was an attempt to increase them during the time Mr Frazer was Postmaster-General. I ask Unfortunately, however, owing to the Postmaster-General, is ib a fact that the hours of these girls have been increased ?

I understand that this arrangement has now been carried out. The matter has not come before me officially, but I believe that those concerned placed the matter before the Deputy Postmaster-General, come the difficulty. In all the other States the girls work 37 hours per week. The new arrangement in New South Wales does not lengthen the hours; it simply puts tlie girls in the State on the same footing as those in other States. ter-General see that subscribers, in connection with the introduction of the, automatic telephone system in Perth, are not charged fees unless they have effective and correct results to their calls? matter and see thab the subscribers in Perth are on tbe same footing as those anywhere else. of the fact that a number of men engaged on cable jointing have recently been dismissed, will the Postmaster General take steps to see whether they can,, if possible, be reinstated?

While we are helping the Government to put through this business, the Government ought not to take advantage of that attitude on the part of the Opposition to bring down a controversial programme when we have helped them to clear the decks for it.

AndI invite the Prime Minister to tell the House, if not now, at any rate at the earliest possible moment, what his intentions are. I cannot see why he should not tell us now.

They are profoundly uninteresting to the ordinary member, and even my right honourable friend yawned when I was explaining them to him. honourable the Attorney-General has suggested that the Government are making no appeal to the Opposition for goodnatured accommodation, but, as a matter of fact, he did not speak quite truly. Being -acquainted with parliamentary procedure, we know that the Government are asking for a concession from the Opposition as to the way in which they shall conon both sides of the House. duct their business. AndI think the opportune appeal of the Leader of the Opposition is a reasonable one, viz., that if we consent to convenience the Government in the conduct of their business in the way suggested, they, in turn, should tell us what work we shall have to do this session. This motion really proposes the arrangement sheet, and, naturally, when we start a session with such an elaborate programme as was contained in the Governor General's sire to know what' measures mentioned therein are going to make their appearance, and when they are to be taken. I do not know whether the Prime Minister is in a position to make a declaration on that point, but it seems to me that there is nothing unreasonable in the request of the Leader of the Opposition that honourable members should know what business we are expected to do..

Why, sir, this very note was sounded by a Minister only a night or two ago. too. the public may know it, let me place on record the fact that the proposal made by the right honourable member for Wide Bay, on 30th March, 1909, was that we should have, in the first place, four ocean destroyers, each of 1,300 tons. Those were to be his four big boats. The Emden could have knocked every one of them out of the water. The other boats which my right honourable friend proposed ""we should have were sixteen destroyers, of the improved River class, of 700 tons each. We were to have sixteen of these cockleshells careering around the Australian coast.",19,Amendment S Incorporation

The Labour party themselves are heartily ashamed of that proposal. It is time this nonsense on their part ceased. The warships that are now protecting Australia were not of their proposition at all. Their proposal was that we should have the fleet of vessels I have just described. The Emden, the Scharnhorst or the Gneisnau could have dealt with the whole lot of them, and sacked our cities as well. This, then, was the Labour party's programme-thi s Mr J. H .

Does he propose to so on with it? granted, but a Bill is often circulated for the information of honourable members before leave is obtained. amounts which we are voting, in this piecemeal way, in anticipation of the Budget, soon to be delivered, I hope, total £10,754,000. Every one knows, however, that the circumstances are extraordinary, and I make no complaint whatever in regard to these expenditures. The right honourable gentleman can have as many more of these Bills as he feels he ought to have, in so far as they relate to the war preparations that are now proceeding. There is one proposal, and it was referred to this afternoon by the honourable member for New England, which I much regret was not brought to fruition long ago. I allude to the pensions for the Expeditionary Forces. That should have heen one of the first matters to be dealt with. an early date. tend to know the reason for the delay. Before tbe men left our shores we were under a moral obligation to let them know the exact conditions under which they were proceeding to the war. Members of the Imperial Forces, both officers and men, know exactly what they are facing. The latest proposal, I read, is to increase the pensions of the soldiers. I think that the British Government might very well do so, having regard to the small amount which they are paid over there. We can afford to be more generous, ana 1 hope we shall be. When we left office there was in existence a draft pensions scheme. honourable agreed at the first Conference to a uniform proposal. as to the pay of the troops. There was a draft pensions scheme in existence when to provide for we left office, but I do not pretend to know what is the reason for the delay in shaping it and putting it before Parliament. layed. the Government expedite this matter so that the men will know exactly what they are to expect. It is only fair to them, and particularly is it due to those dependent upon the men who are going out to fight our battles for us, that they should know what we propose to do for them. We have made an excellent beginning in connection with the war, and I hope that it is only a beginning. The war, if I know anything about it , is going to be a very long one. All the experts agree on that point, and so long as the war exists we are under obligations to do our very utmost;-to the last soldier we can send-to see it to a successful conclusion. We have sent away one expeditionary force of 20,000 men. Three months have elapsed since the war broke out, and I should like to know whether the Treasurer can indicate what course the Government are going to follow so far as the future of the war is concerned. I see that Senator Pearce said the other night, at the Town Hall, that already 42,000 soldiers had been provided for. I do not know how he makes up that number, and would like to see the details; but, so far, only one expeditionary force of 20,000 has left the shores of Australia. This, it seems to me, is very far from being a sufficient contribution, in view of the tremendous war in which we are engaged. Great Britain has 1,250,000 men under arms; and I understand that she is asking for another 1,000,000. If there is a rich prize in this war it is Australia; and I should say that Germany would rather, many times over, have this country to-morrow than she would even Great Britain. public. show what we have at stake. I am not gentleman's Government quite sure that we realize the position; or, if we do, we are not expressing it as yet in the number of men we send oversea.",21,Supply Bill No 3

246,Mr Joseph Cook,"I am trying toCompare our numbers alongside the men from the rest of the Empire, or with those of our Allies, and we see at once that our contribution is a very small one. I am now merely urging the Government to get on with the recruiting of more men, so as to give Australia adequate representation in the theatre of war. It is no use sending the men in such small numbers that they are killed as fast as we send them; it is far better to send as many as possible at the outset, so as to make as respectable a show as is in our power, because this must be infinitely more effective than dribbling men along later on. I know, of course, all the difficulties of equipment, and I am not making the slightest complaint, but urging the Government to see that nothing arrests them in the course they have set out for themselves, and to send another force or two as soon as ever circumstances )ermit. Servia, who is fighting for her { ife, has a population of only 4,500,000, and she has 500,000 in the fighting line, while Belgium, with a population about as large as that of Canada, has all her available men under arms. tain is arranging to have 2,250,000 men at the front, and Australia, with ii ninth of the population of the Mother Country, should, on a proportional basis, have considerably over 200,000 men in the field as our share in this mighty struggle of life and death. I know that it costs a great deal more to send troops from Australia than it does from any other place, and I am not suggesting that we should send 250,000 men at this moment, though I think that we should do that sooner than see the battle lost. We should, no doubt, aim at something considerably less than. that for the present, but Australia ought to make a powerful contribution to the fighting strength of the Empire. My idea is that the Government should get the equipment from wherever they can. Senator Pearce gave utterance to an admirable sentiment the other night at the Town Hall when he said that our Forces should be equipped from head to heel in Australia; and that would be all very well if we could do it quickly. way to give assistance. it is possible to give it ; but I do not think that even this consideration ought to hinder the despatch of troops. We must not wait for equipment, but must do what we can, and in the quickest possible time. If we can get our equipment here, so much the better; and I hope we may be able to continue to do so. But we ought not to wait for the equipment; that is the point above all others to he regarded. The greater the effective force in the field in these early stages, the shorter will be the duration of the war, and less the loss of life in the long run. The Prime Minister must not understand me as making the slightest complaint, but as merely expressing the opinion that our efforts should he accelerated very considerably, because this will prove the cheaper, and better, and safer for all concerned. I had intended making some remarks regarding the Imperial loan; that is to say, if it is an Imperial loan. The Prime Minister has not told us, and I do not think he has told anybody, where he is getting the money; and that is the peculiar part of the transaction. This is, I think, the first time in the history of parliamentary government Great Briwhen such an important matter of public expenditure and public finance has heen made a solemn and profound mystery. there never was a war of this kind before. discussing the war, but the £18,000,000 to which reference has already been made; and the Prime Minister is under obligation to tell the country all about it at the earliest moment. mystery is about the borrowing of £18,000,000 I do not pretend to know. The facts regarding it have already appeared in the newspapers, and everybody knows them; and it seems to me to be foolish for the Prime Minister to play the mystery man when the heads of other Governments are telling the public all about the situation. be authentic when we get it here. now. Mr Holman has already told the people of New South Wales the amount he is to get-roughl y a little less than £8,000,000.

There is only one other item in the schedule of the Bill to which I should like to call attention, namely, £1,000, under the head of ""Miscellaneous,"" for the administration of the Bureau of Agriculture. We have no Bureau of Agriculture, and, as yet, no statutory authority to establish one; indeed, there is no Bill before us. It seems strange to be providing money in a Supply Bill for a Department that has not yet been created; but perhaps the Minister of Trade and Customs may be able to give us some explanation. able gentleman is rather in favour of a Bureau of Agriculture. of putting through a Bill at the earliest possible moment providing for a scientific Bureau of Agriculture.

In any case, it is not -usual to introduce policy proposals in a monthly Supply Bill honourable member. Prime Minister know why the item appears ? further to say at present. But, I say again, I hope the Prime Minister will expedite the despatch of the expeditionary forces. The wastage in war is, I believe, about 60 per cent, per annum, so that what we are now doing will just about keep 20,000 of our men effective in the field. We ought to try to give a fillip to recruiting in Australia at the earliest possible moment, and send along men with such equipment as we can procure, so that we may take a worthy and adequate share in the great war being waged for our safety, as well as for the safety of the whole of the Empire. The pensions proposals are, I think, long overdue; and I suggest that the Prime Minister should let us know definitely something of the scheme, which ought to have been introduced and passed through both Houses long ago. This is only due to the men on their way to the front; and I think it would give a tremendous impetus to recruiting if it were known that adequate provision was to be made for dependants. ister and Treasurer) [4.35] -The Government are fully in sympathy with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition regarding the duty of the Commonwealth in furnishing an adequate number of efficient soldiers to help to bring about the early termination of the war.

The Leader of the Opposition omitted to mention that this Commonwealth is the only Dominion under the Crown that has provided a fully-equipped naval unit.

The burden we have shouldered is greater than that of any other Dominion, the cost of maintaining the Navy alone being far greater than the expenditure undertaken by our senior sister Dominion, Canada, in the despatch of Expeditionary Forces. I make this comparison merely to show that the Commonwealth has no need to apologize for what it has done.

Before the Budget speech is delivered, the Government will introduce a Bill to provide for military pensions. It is for Parliament to determine what the pension scheme shall be, so that the Government may make provision for it in the Budget. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that the pensions should be adequate in view of the sacrifices made. We have provided pensions for the relief of persons in other walks of life, and there is little difference, so far as the suffering and misery entailed is concerned, between loss of life on the battlefield and failure in the industrial warfare. I do not intend to discuss the origin of our Navy, and who first conceived the idea. Undoubtedly our defence at sea was the subject of the severest controversy five years ago, and, happily, as experience has shown, the right decision Zealand, who, three years ago, strongly opposed tlie establishment of local navies, now is in favour of them. I believe, though I am expressing my own view only, that the strength and unity of the British Empire will be increased by a wider distribution of armed forces on the sea, with greater autonomy. If this increase of autonomy is granted freely and cheerfully by the Mother Country, the striking force of the Navy will be increased, and mobilization can be undertaken more quickly than at the present time. That view is supported by independent and capable observers who have visited this country. Their conclusion is that while unity of command is necessary, there must be a larger delegation of executive power if we are to make the best of our Naval Forces. I hope that the time is not far distant when other parts of the Empire will see fit to fall into line with the Commonwealth in the matter of naval defence. After what took place OD Monday, local criticism of the Australian Navy should cease. That Navy is believed in and supported by all the citizens of the Commonwealth, whatever their political party may be. I am sure that we would all like the outside world to know that Australians are absolutely united in tbeir policy of defence at sea and on land. Whenever in Opposition, they have protested against attempts to make political and I hope that the Prime Minister's lead will be followed by all members of his party, including the Minister of Trade and Customs, credit being given to all who in their various spheres of action have assisted to build up our Australian defence.

Whatever political parties may claim in this connection, nothing could have been done had not the taxpayers shown their willingness to make the necessary sacrifices. taxpayers, political parties could have done nothing. I agree with the Prime Minister that the controversy as to which political party should have the credit for our defence should end, but before leaving tlie subject. I wish to put on record, in an unpartisan manner, one or two statements of fact. In 1902, when the Barton Government was in power, a report on Naval Defence was obtained from Captain Creswell, who recommended the establishment of an Australian Navy, to consist of four cruisers, whose equipment he set out in detail. In 1903 a debate took place in this Chamber, in which many honourable members participated, as to whether we should continue the Imperial contribution or make a beginning with an Australian Navy. If honourable members will turn up the debates they will see that Liberals, like the honourable member for Angas and others, took up strongly the idea of an Australian Navy. you joined the Fusion party. 1905, Captain Creswellp u t aside the proThe Government of that day went fur posal for cruisers, and suggested a ""Unit ther.

On the 13th December, 1907, was delivered in this House, by the then Prime Minister, one of the most complete statements upon land and sea defence ever delivered in this Parliament. Mr Deakin set out a proposal for six destroyers, nine submarines, and two depot ships, making seventeen boats in all. A t the conclusion of that speech the present Prime Minister congratulated Mr Deakin upon it . The honourable member for Wide Bay saidThe subject is a big one, and I do not think I have ever heard the honourable member to greater advantage.

Then, on the 30th March, 1909, the Fisher scheme was announced at Gympie, namely, four ocean destroyers, sixteen destroyers (improved River class) in addition to three already ordered, and one vessel armed for police duties, making a total of twenty-four, exactly the same number as had been recommended hy the Commonwealth Naval Officers' Committee in September, 1906. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports asks, "" What about the Dreadnought episode?"" At that time matters became critical with regard to the Empire. time the international situation became critical, and several members of the Liberal party suggested that a Dreadnought should be offered by Australia in the same way as one had been offered by New Zealand; but, at the same time, they made it perfectly clear that that offer should not in the slightest degree interfere with the proposal for the establishment of an Australian Navy. That point was made clear beyond all doubt. The Labour Government were defeated that year, and the third Deakin Government' came into power. An offer of a Dreadnought was then definitely made by the Liberal Government, and these despatches contain telegrams in which the Deakin Government offered a Dreadnought, or its equivalent, to the Empire, whilst at the to appropriate £250,000,' same time they announced their intention to proceed with the creation of an Australian Navy. no Dreadsiiought here. Dreadnought, or its equivalent, was offered to the Empire, wherever it might be required by the Imperial authorities. quired. cordance with the declarations made in public. in a minute. In the meantime the Government of the day announced clearly that, so far as they were concerned, they desired a conference with the Imperial authorities upon the whole question of naval defence, and were quite prepared to consider any proposal made by the Admiralty as being requisite for the naval defence of Australia and the Empire. Colonel Foxton did go to the Imperial Conference to represent the Australian Government, and bases were arrived at between him, on behalf of Australia, and the Naval authorities with respect to a Fleet Unit, which is the Fleet Unit in Australia to-day. That is clearly shown in the Imperial Conference's report. It was suggested that Australia should provide a Fleet Unit, to consist of one armoured cruiser of the Indomitable class, three unarmoured cruisers of the Bristol class, six destroyers of the improved River class, and three submarines of the "" C "" class. That was modified later on by an agreement with the Admiralty in 1912 that our Unit should consist of one armoured cruiser of the Indefatigable class, three second class protected cruisers of the Weymouth class, six destroyers of the improved River class, and two sub-",26,Supply Bill No 3

A motion for the establishment of the FleetU n it was submitted in this House by the present Leader of the Opposition, and was carried, and that was the first parliamentary approval of the scheme. In December, 1909, the then Government despatched a cable to the Imperial authorities ordering the present battle cruiser Australia, which is the vessel we are all so proud of to-day. .There is no doubt about these facts, and the same cablegram definitely stated that the three cruisers, now known as the Sydney, the Brisbane, and the Melbourne, were to follow. This is all ancient history to most of us, but it is necessary to put the facts before the public, because, day after day, statements are made which would make it appear that the Labour party were the sole originators of our present Australian Navy. Labour party !that they accepted the policy advocated by the Liberal party. That is the reason why all Australia is behind the policy. It is an Australian policy, belonging to neither one side nor the other. bers that I would read the cable that was sent by the then Governor General, Lord Dudley, to the Secretary of State on the 4th June, 1909, offering a Dreadnought to the Imperial Government. That cable readsGovernment of Commonwealth of Australia take earliest opportunity, after assuming office, to inform Prime Minister, as President of Imperial Conference, that they will shortly submit to Parliament their proposals for defence of Commonwealth and its_ coasts. It is thus seen that we informed the I m perial Government thab we had our proposals for the defence of the CommonwealthThey now beg to offer to the Empire an Australian Dreadnought, or such addition to its naval strength as may be determined after consultation with Naval and Military Conference in London, at which it will be represented. This offer will be communicated to Parliament immediately it reassembles. The Dreadnought of that day was sneered at, but it is the flagship Australia of to-day; and I say that, whether that vessel was required for the Australian Navy or not, the fact remains that if the Empire wanted such a boat to-day, there is no one in Australia who would not offer such a ship to the Empire. That is the test. want it . want it , no harm was done in making the offer; bub while our Navy is in 'Australia, and is passed over to the Imperial control in time of war, it is an Empire force all the time, and it is the wish of the people of Australia that it should be so. I do not wish to go further, into this matter, but it is only fair that a few facts should be p u t on record. I hope that in future the Australian Navy w ill not be regarded either as a Liberal or Labour creation. It is an Australian Navy, supported by all oarties, and paid for by the taxpayers generally. As I have already said, the Labour party are entitled to credit for taking up the scheme propounded by their Liberal predecessors, It stands to the credit of the and carrying it on from the sbage it had then reached.

I am pleased that the Prime Minister has included the Bureau of Agriculture in his programme. The matter was not mentioned in the Speech delivered by the Governor General at the opening of the session. I do not know when Ministers decided to take up the policy. The Bureau was mentioned in the policy speech of the right honourable gentleman during the elections in 1910; hut, though the Labour party was in power for three years, it did nothing to establish it, and last session it the North Sea or anywhere else, was one effectually succeeded in preventing the late Government from carrying it out.

Minister will"" find that the States will not object to the Commonwealth undertaking the purely national sphere-that is, the scientific investigation of pests and diseases affecting animals and plants all over the continent. I know that on the part of the Queensland Government, the Victorian Government, and others, there was no objection to the Commonwealth taking that sphere of action. The Scottish Commission, all practical men, who knew what they were talking about, investigated the matter from an impartial stand-point, and studied it from a practical point of view, strongly advocated the establishment of this Bureau on the lines that I have indicated. [5.10] -In common with other members who have preceded me, I wish to prevent this matter of defence from becoming a partisan one, but I believe that partisanship can be put aside, while, at the same time, a few facts may be given. When the first Fisher Government left office in 1909, and the Deakin Government came into existence, Colonel Foxton went to Great Britain to attend an Imperial Conference, and what took place at that Conference is green in the memory of all of us. That those who took part in that Conference believed that an Australian Navy was very desirable was very evident. Up to that point all was well. pened at the 1907 Conference? the year 1909. There is no need to go back further than that year. you to do so. 1910 were fought with all the usual bitterness of political fights, and the question of whether our Fleet should be an Australian one, or one that should be handed over to Great Britain, or sent to of the biggest points fought out. In that year, 1910, the Age took up the stand that it was desirable to have an Australian Navy. On the other hand, the attitude of the Argus was that the navy should be a British Navy, and not an Australian one. The Argus advocated the payment of a larger subsidy to the British Government. Honourable members can turn up the files and see the articles. your dates. Argus was the advocate of the Conservative party now in Opposition, and then in power; but, to the dismay of the Jingoes, as a result of the 1910 elections, the Labour party came into power, and decided that we should have an Australian Navy.

Everyone remembers that a twopenny-halfpenny play called The Englishman's Home was brought out. It was a beautiful dodge with the idea of charging the Labour party with being disloyal, with wanting to cut the painter, with not realizing the position, and with being without the desire to remain a portion of the Empire. The Jingoes said that the other Dominions had started sending Dreadnoughts to England, and they suggested that Australia should do the same. However, the Labour Government said "" No !

Coming to the question of the contingents that we are sending away, I must express my surprise at the position taken up this afternoon hy the Leader of the Opposition in discussing the subject, although he was careful to say that he did not desire to make any attack on the Government. ber expressed regret that we could not get our men away more speedily and in larger numbers than at present. The honourable member for Perth interjected that what was desired was not equipment but men. Let me assure the honourable member that men without proper equipment would be perfectly useless. they need not be equipped. are fighting in France and Belgium today, and are gradually driving back the German hordes. Great Britain has some 1.200,000 more men who are being trained for service on the continent. Why are these men not sent abroad at once? The answer is that Lord Kitchener does not consider them to be efficient, and that they are not yet properly equipped. No doubt he feels that during the winter campaign, when much cannot be done, they can be well drilled and equipped to take the field in the spring. The British Army on the continent, I am assured, is the most efficient and best equipped that ever took the field in any part of the world, and it was only because of this that they were able to withstand the rush of the Germans during the historic retreat from Mons. have withstood such an onslaught as was made upon them. And so I say to the Government that every contingent that we send from Australia must be not only well trained, but so equipped that ib can at once take its place in the field. The British Government are not able to clothe, boot, and equip all their own men at the present moment, and we should not assist them by saying, "" Here are men for you, but you must equip them."" There is one other matter which J desire to bring forward, and I shall do so with, a certain amount of diffidence. With all due respect to the teetotal section of the community, I venture the opinion that those who conduct the temperance movement are the most intemperate I have ever heard speak. I wish to approach, from a common-sense standpoint, the question of dry camps. I make an appeal to those who know something of the drink traffic, and there are very few teetotallers who do. It is not so much the imbibing of strong drink as tlie evils of the drink traffic that we wish to avoid. The taking of strong drink in moderation does not prevent a man The right honourable memfrom being a good soldier. Some of the finest soldiers the world has ever known have had their share of beer, and some of the finest sailors their share of rum. I certainly do not desire that the Australian Army shall be a drunken one. I think that the consumption of alcohol by our troops should be supervised by the Defence Department itself. member read Lord Roberts on the question? the drink question than fifty Lord Roberts could know. member know as much about it as does the honourable member for Brisbane? whisky from bad, whereas he does not. I hope that the Minister of Defence will display his common sense by trying to regulate the consumption of alcohol in our camps instead of pretending to abolish it altogether. If any effective step could be taken to prevent the consumption of strong drink in military camps, the position would be different; but the system now in force is calculated to make drunkards of men who would hot Half-trained men could never otherwise be so. An effort is being made to maintain a dry camp. We know that the average man drinks beer. He cannot afford to pay for champagne, and he has not acquired a taste for whisky. When he cannot obtain beer in camp he surreptitiously takes in a bottle of whisky, and very often it is the vilest stuff that could be bought. I do not hesitate to say that in all our so-called dry camps there is being introduced a lot of horrible whisky, the consumption of which maddens men who would not be affected by a glass of beer. The Australian nation is not a drunken one. I have had as much experience of our young men as has any honourable member. I think I know every young man in my constituency.

331,Mr Mathews,"Yes; I know goodthat ever paraded the streets, and they would not even drink a glass of shandygaff. It cannot be said of our Australian youths that they are drunkards. We are told that the Russians are a drunken people, but I deny that Australians are. they were? This is most intemperate language. fairly abstemious, but as they are not able to get a drink in camp they, in many cases, take into it a lot of inferior spirit. When they get twenty-four hours' leave many of them say, "" We can get no driuk in camp, so we will have a good skinful while we are out."" It is in this way that harm is done to our men. I want a stop to be put to this sort of thing, and I appeal to all who wish to abolish the evils of the drink traffic to try to bring about some better system than has yet heen conceived. I maintain that we shall never get rid of the evil by declaring for dry canteens, when we know very well that such a proposition cannot be carried out. We pass laws to regulate every phase of society, and it is ridiculous that we cannot regulate the supply of strong drink in camp instead of pretending to do away with it altogether. It is, after all, only a pretence. The community does not consist solely of intemperate teetotallers. We have in our midst many rational men and women who are moderate drinkers. I know that the teetotallers say that the moderate drinker is worse than the drunkard, but my answer is that the teetotaller does not understand the situation. The men in our camps are going tc take our place in the battlefield; some of us ought to be going with them. Many of them have, rightly or wrongly, acquired the habit of taking some alcoholic refreshment; but as soon as they are sent into camp they have forced upon them a system of which they disapprove. It is a silly method that we are adopting, and I appeal to the teetotal section of the community to devise a better one. I think that 95 per cent, of the officers of any army would prefer to regulate the drink traffic amongst their men rather than have an attempt to prevent it altogether. If we established canteens in the camps, and arranged for them to be properly looked after by the officers, we should go a long way towards securing what we desire. [20]2 than the men. that the honourable member should make such a statement. I have known officers who took drink, but who took care to keep their men sober. We know that an officer who gets drunk does not want to see his men get-drunk. who was a drunkard would take care, I think, so to regulate the canteen under bis control as to keep his men from getting drunk. I am not urging that our troops should be allowed to get drunk. Such a position would be almost as silly as that taken up by the teetotaller. I am merely appealing to the Government to regulate the drink traffic in our camps, and not to continue the present system, which is detrimental to the well-being of every soldier who has ever taken a drop of liquor. We should introduce a system of regulation that will make ""our camps sober, instead of sly-grog, communities. I know that the teetotal section of the community are actuated by a desire to do good. A lot of large-hearted men and women have devoted years of their lives to the cause without any recompense ether than that which they derive from the knowledge that the community is a sober one. But they do not understand the drink question, because they have never taken any part in the drink traffic. Perhaps, if there were more reformed drunkards in the Temperance party, their efforts would have more effect. able member not try his hand ? teetotalism in this House, the honourable member for Brisbane, has an idea that at the back of my head there is a spark that requires a lot of quenching; but I tell him that I take my present stand as a man who was born in the army, and know its conditions, and who> is familiar with the urink problem in all kinds of places, from bush townships to largelypopulated centres, and my opinion is that the traffic is one to be regulated-that it is the misuse of drink, and not its use, that we have to prevent.

A t the same time, I am disappointed that the Prime Minister has made no statement, not only in regard to the two Bills that have heen mentioned, but also in regard to the general financial position of the country.

There is no doubt that, at one time or another, most of us have expressed views different from those which we now hold. progressive men. Minister of Defence, in the early days of Federation, the idea of expenditure in this direction found very little favour; and it was stated, I think, by the Leader of the Labour party of that day, that a very few hundred thousand pounds was sufficient; but, as I say, the views of honourable members opposite, and also of honourable members on this side, have changed a good deal since then. I remember at that time-il901-that the Defence vote, which was less than £900,000, as submitted by me as Minister of Defence, was, at the instance of the Labour party, reduced by £180,000; and when Sir William Lyne was acting for me as Minister of Defence, he promised to reduce it by another £60,000 in the following year. However, I do not think either party achieve any good purpose by taking to themselves all the credit for our present position in defence matters; there is no advantage in disparaging the efforts of others.. As Minister of Defence, I introduced a Bill in 1909, under the authority of which it was proposed to borrow £3,500,000 for the purpose of We might have building a Navy; and, certainly, in our circumstances then, a'; Navy could not have been constructed without borrowed money, seeing that, owing to the .introPersonally, I duction of old-age pensions, we could not have financed ourselves otherwise. However, owing to the alteration in connection with the Braddon section, the borrowed money was not required. I admit that, in the early years of Federation, I was not an advocate for a local Navy, but favoured an Imperial Navy. Mine was a broad-based Imperial idea, founded on a common kindred and a common interest. My hope was that all the self governing Dominions would contribute, on a basis to be arranged, to maintain an Empire Navy, in which we should all be partners. I looked forward to a time when we should be represented at the Admiralty, and have a closer relationship with the defence of the Empire, and with the great questions of peace and war, than we haye now. Afterwards, however, when I found that the idea was not so acceptable to the people of this country as that of a local Navy, I was quite willing to accept the latter, because the object I had in view was to defend the Commonwealth, and to assist in the maintenance of the integrity of the Empire; and he would be a pig-headed man who, because he could not get all he wanted, would refuse to take anythinghalf a loaf is better than no bread. By this Billi t is proposed to appropriate a further sum of £925,000, in addition to £1.650,000 voted last month, making a total appropriation of £2,575,000 for the Expeditionary Forces.

One point strikes me, namely, that we are not bound to provide money for the States except on the ground that the States cannot obtain it for themselves. borrow at a reasonable price, and the Commonwealth can do so, we should do what we can to assist them; but I think it would not be unreasonable for us to ask how the States ""propose to spend the money. It may be said that the States are responsible Governments, and that the various Parliaments wil l have to be given this information, and that, therefore, we ought not to interfere in local affairs. A t the same time, if the Commonwealth has to make itself responsible for the £18,000,000 for the benefit of the States, we are entitled to some little assurance on the matter. The Commonwealth is, perhaps, the most interested in the welfare of the primary producers, and, in my opinion, it would not be too much to ask the State Governments to see that this money is spent in such a way as to be wealth-producing for the country generally. A t the present time, those engaged in country pursuits are suffering severely from the drought, and I do not think we would be going too far if we inquired how much of the expenditure was to be devoted to assisting and protecting agricultural interests. It would make the passing of the LoanB ill through this House much easier if we were able to assure the people that a considerable portion of the money would be devoted to the end I have suggested. We should thus provide for the giving of assistance where it is required, to the benefiting of the whole community. It I should have may be objected that we cannot interfere. I do not advocate interference at the point of the bayonet, so to speak, bub I I think that we should do good by the expression of our strong opinion and desire that expenditure shall be in a certain direction. Any expression of that kind would, I am sure, not go unheeded. of money for public works release ample and sufiicient capital for other enterThere is prises ? public works that are urgently required, and others that are political, and the Commonwealth should not provide funds to assist the socialistic ideals of a political party.

356,Mr Finlayson (Brisbane) [5.52],"fco go fully into this very difficult and perplexing question; I take my stand on the ground that the drink traffic cannot be regulated. perience of regulation and restriction of every kind, it must be admitted that the drink traffic defies regulation and restriction, and that the only sensible way of dealing with it is to prohibit it . Section 123A of the DefenceA c t saysNo intoxicating or spirituous liquors shall be sold or supplied, and no person shall have such intoxicating liquors in his possession at any naval or military canteen, camp, fort, or post during such, time as training of persons as prescribed in paragraphs (a), (6), and (c) of section 125, is proceeding in such naval or military camp, fort, or post, except as prescribed for purely medical purposes. The section was meant to apply to camps of military training under our universal training system, and particularly to camps in which youths were being trained. Parliament has affirmed, and, I think, would re-affirm, the necessity of maintaining dry canteens in all camps in which cadets were under training. Under the limited interpretation that I have mentioned, Senator Millen unwisely allowed wet canteens to be established in the camps maintained for the Expeditionary Forces. Senator Pearce, who followed him , gave the section a wider interpretation, and disallowed wet canteens; hence these tears. good effect? has. Speaking from my own experience does not drink. suggest that therefore I know nothing about the subject on which I am speaking. would be competent to express an opinion on any subject were a test of that kind applied ? My experience of the Enoggera camp, where there was a wet canteen, was of a most saddening character. The camp was, perhaps, the best conducted in the Oommonwealth, because the military commandant of Queensland objects to wet canteens, but there was nevertheless a regrettable and a disgracef u l amount of drunkenness even there. The men were allowed so much leave that they were able to visit city hotels, and not merely to -satisfy their immediate wants, but also to obtain supplies of liquor which they took into the canip. Things became so serious that special efforts had to be made by the commandant A f t e r 2,000 years' exto put an end to the scenes that occurred, and special orders were issued for that purpose. What happened amounted to a public scandal. No more sad sight has been seen in our cities and towns-and it could be witnessed here in Melbourne -tha n the reeling about our streets of drunken men clad in military uniform . What should be and has not yet been done is to stop the introduction of liquor into the camps. W h y should men he allowed to take liquor into the camps when Parliament has declared that liquor shall not be taken into them? The greatest slygrog sellers that we have are the licensed hotel keepers. No persons more consistently and audaciou'sly break and defy the law than those engaged in the liquor traffic. should not utter a slander like that with out possessing f u l l information. straight-out, open, and distinct charge. The nations now at war have ordered the avoidance of intoxicants by their armies. Kitchener's message to the troops contained the injunction to abstain from liquor, and Lord Roberts, and every other British general of note, has always advocated such abstention. General Grant, of In my opinion it the United States army, once saidGive me the sober man, the absolute teetotaller, every time. He is dependable. If I had the greatest appointive power in the country, no man would get even the smallest appointment from me unless he showed proof It is ridiculous to of his absolute teetotalism. If I could, by offering my body a sacrifice, free this country from this fell cancer, the demon drink, I'd How many honourable members thank the Almighty for the privilege of doing it. Listen to this from Germany. Count von Haiseler has saidThe soldier that can abstain altogether is the best man; he can accomplish more, march better, and is a better soldier than the man who drinks even moderately. . . . Strong drink tires and only increases thirst. For soldiers, water, coffee, and, above all, tea, are the best drinks.

362,Mr Finlayson,"I am making amen, or the stout men, or the thin men, the old men, or the young men, but the drinking men, as plainly as if they had been labelled on the back. The Parliament of Norway has passed a resolution declaring that both army and navy messes shall be non-alcoholic. and water waggon, and the British Navy is proceeding in the same direction. Admiral von. Muller has stated thatIn the German navy, grog rations are excluded from ships, and all canteens on shore and afloat, and to every recruit joining the navy is given a pamphlet warning them against alcoholic abuse. Among the regulations issued for the government of the New Zealand Expeditionary Forces is thisThe men are to be reminded that, on the voyage, their first aim and object should be to keep themselves fit in every respect, and that each man out of the firing line is a drag on his comrades. It should be noted that cigarette smoking impairs a man's marching power. No liquor of any sort or description will be . allowed on board, except that in charge of the medical officer for medical purposes. This prohibition includes the officers' mess. All bars are to be sealed. W it h the sad recollection of their experiences in the war with Japan, the Russians have taken a very courageous course. The Czar last year issued an order under which officers are forbidden to drink spirits in camp or on duty. Commanding officers are ordered to discourage drinking, and recommended to set an example of abstinence. are forbidden to the men at all times, and the most stringent measures will be taken to prevent them from buying them. Medical officers are to deliver lectures to officers and men concerning the harmfu l effects of alcohol. Major-GeneralK i r k patrick, who was Inspector-General of the Commonwealth Forces, reported.My observation this year leads me to believe"" that, on the whole, the absence of liquor was an advantage, and that, as the men accustomed to alcoholic beverages at the canteens complete their service, its absence will not be noticed during the short training period of the militia. I refrain from making further quotations. is this: The armies and navies of to-day are intended to be, first and last, efficient fighting machines. terferes with their efficiency is discouraged, and experience, and the result of every test and observation, prove that nothing impairs their efficiency, nothing so interferes with and hinders their work, nothing is more destructive of their discipline, than the use of alcohol.

That position is illogical. The evil is in the drink itself; it does not matter where it is drunk, or who serves it . I made an interjection about the officers being worse than the men, and I desire to substantiate that statement by saying that the anxiety to have wet canteens in the camps is wholly due to the desire on the part of the .officers to secure perquisites for themselves. There was a conference of militia officers in Melbourne in October, 1911, and they recommended that wet canteens should be reintroduced into camp For what reason? The main reason was that they had lost a certain amount of pocketmoney by the abolition of the canteen. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports stated that a drunken officer always insisted on his men being sober. By that very statement the honourable memSpirits ber admitted that he knew the disadvantage of men being in any way inclined to the drink habit. ber does not seem able to separate the man who drinks from the man who gets drunk. cannot separate the'two. teetotallers cannot rather wide of the argument which I wish to emphasize.

AdmiralK in g H a l l, who was in charge of the Australian Naval Station for some years, after completing f if t y years of service at sea, saidAs a naval officer, I am well within the mark when I say that 75 per cent, of the trouble in our service arises from the drink question, and that if we could have a service of total abstainers crime would be practically nil, and the service more efficient, as I proved in a paper entitled "" I s the service more efficient for Alcohol?"" read at the Imperial Institute some four years back. The testimony is prolific and unanimous, and most of the naval experts and military officers in the world have declared in favour of dry canteens ashore and afloat. The only reply of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is that "" You know nothing about it ; you are a fanatic."" I prefer to follow the man with expert knowledge and experience. with the right honourable the Prime Minister in deprecating the public discussion of matters in connection w it h the war, which are better l e ft untouched; b'ut, I think it is only reasonable that honourable members should take this, the first, opportunity of referring to certain phases of the grave issue that is before us. I intend to take advantage of that opportunity very briefly, and in a way which, I trust, will not overstep the discretion that ought to rest on the lips of every member of the House. I was very glad to hear the references to the matter of pensioning those who may be disabled, If the honourable or the relatives of those who may be killed during the war, and I also join in the hope that these pensions may be of a liberality that will make any dependence upon public charity unnecessary. I think the Commonwealth can very well afford to do that, and that it should not be left to private charity to supplement what it is certainly the duty of the country as a whole to do. In this connection, I have had some difficulty with regard to a f u n d that is being added to very rapidly in Australia; that is the patriotic f u n d , which exists in the various States, and I cannot"" agree to the sum total of which must now be very considerable. A t the inception of the war, we had a patriotic f u n d in Western Australia that has remained in existence since the Boer War, and, while I was discussing the object of the f u n d with one T h a t is for a of the trustees, he informed me that it was impossible to apply that money to any other purpose than the direct assistance of those who had participated in the war; thus the fund, which amounted to several thousands of pounds, was useless for any other purpose. If the Government are going to make ample provision for those who may lose their support during the war, I desire to know what the patriotic f u n d is to be applied to? According to the basis of the f u n d , in Western Australia, at any rate, the money can only be applied to the assistance of those who have suffered by reason of actually participating in the war. plies to the patriotic fund in Victoria. there w ill not he the need for the application of the patriotic funds in this particular direction, and a considerable sum of money w ill remain unutilized simply because it cannot legally be applied in any other way. If this money cannot be applied in the direction of alleviating distress arising out of the warI am told that in Western Australia, at at tlie same time, any rate, it cannot-it is just as well",37,Supply Bill No 3

395,Mr Fowler,"It now appears thatat this stage to make inquiry as to whether there is any great necessity for ithe accumulation of money, in this particular fund, such as is going on at the present time. If the money cannot be utilized to deal with distress arising out of the war through unemployment, and with cases of absolute hardship suffered by women and children, it is high time another fund was in existence to which public charity might be directed, -and Which would have for its object the assistance of those who, in these present times of crisis, through no fault of their own, find themselves without the means of buying bread. do that in Victoria. much if the money in this patriotic fund cannot be utilized in the broadest sense, for which, no doubt, many people thought it existed; otherwise their money would not have been contributed to ic. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that we should make a greater effort to convince the people of Australia as to the urgent necessity for entering more enthusiastically into the war. We are all proud of the contingent that we have despatched, 20,000 very fit and capable soldiers, who will give a good account of themselves; but I would like to see another contingent of the same strength going away very shortly . I do not think 1 that we are making a sufiicient effort to advertise the fact that Australia needs recruits. In the Old Country, everywhere, there are posters exhibited calling on the young men of the country to enter the army; but here in Australia, so far as I have been able to ascertain, the only advertisement is one of 3 inches or 4 inches appearing in certain papers, and not seen by one in a hundred. It is the duty of any Government in power to point out to Australia that our interest in the war is even more vital than that of the people of the Old Land. One cannot imagine the rule of the British Isles passing away from the people of the British Isles; but if this war goes against send them Home, where they would get the Empire there is nothing more certain than that the rule of Australia will pass away from the people who occupy this continent at the present time and we shall be brought under the heel of a Prussian despotism which will be something beyond anything many of our Australians believe-possible in these civilized party, if any, is entitled to the particular times. There is urgent necessity for impressing on Australians, and especially on our young men, the need for defending Australia at the point where it requires defence at the present time, namely, on the field"" of battle on the frontier of Belgium. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports objected to a statement that I made by way of interjection a little while ago, that it was more important for Australia to consider the question of sending men than to send them equipped. The statement is quite a truism. Let us equip the men by all means, if we can; but, if we cannot, let us send them Home, and let them be trained and equipped there, as undoubtedly they would be in a very little while. Active operations on the battlefield will very largely come fo a stand-still during the winter, and the work of the warring nations will be mostly in the direction of preparing their forces for the spring campaign. If we send our Australians forward without equipment, they could very readily fall into a general scheme in England for the necessary training that would make them all the fitter to face the enemy on the battlefields of France and Belgium, and, perhaps, Germany. It has to be remembered that the topographical conditions of these countries are entirely different from those of Australia, and it is very necessary that our Australians should get a considerable amount of training under conditions approximating more nearly to those on the field of battle on the Continent than we can find in Australia. The small, frequent enclosures, the frequent streams and ditches, the clumps of timber here and there, and the unevenness of the ground make a set of conditions entirely alien to the Australian. Therefore, I hold very strongly, that if we can get another 20,000 men together, equal in all respects to the 20,000 already despatched, we need not keep them back until they have every strap and buckle, or even every rifle required, but we should their training and all their equipment, and be ready to take the field when they are required in the spring.

Andi t took that shape at the instance of the Imperial authorities themselves.' There were at that time in Australia two schools of thought regarding an Australian Wavy. One was .the .deep-water school, as it is usually called, while the other comprised those who regarded the defence of Australia as more likely to be accomplished by the creation of a mosquito Fleeta Fleet of the smaller class of vessels, that could act only as a defence force close about our coast. The Imperial authorities, however, submitted to the Conference of 1909 a recommendation in which they pointed out that a defence force of that kind for Australia would not meet all the requirements that might arise. I wish to make only one brief quotation to indicate this attitude. At page 23 of the report of the Conference we have the following:In the opinion of the Admiralty, a Dominion Government desirous of creating a Navy should aim at forming a distinct Fleet Unit; and the smallest unit is one which, while manageable in time of peace, is capable of being used in its component parts in time of war. Under certain conditions, the establishment of local defence flotillas, consisting of torpedo craft and submarines, might be of assistance in time of war to the operations of the Fleet; but such flotillas cannot cooperate on the high seas in the wider duties of protection of trade and preventing attacks from hostile cruisers and squadrons. operations of destroyers and torpedo boats are necessarily limited to the waters near the coast, or to a radius of action not far distant from a base, while there are great difficulties in manning such a force and keeping it always thoroughly efficient. torpedo craft would not, in itself, moreover, be a good' means of gradually developing a self-contained Fleet capable of both offence and defence. Unless a naval force-whateve r its size-complie s with this condition, it can are now in commission-the Sydney and never take its proper place in the organization of an Imperial Navy distributed strategically over the whole area of British interests. There was a clear indication by the experts of the Admiralty as to what, in their opinion, Australia should do if. it had made up its mind to attend to its own sea defence.

This was, indeed, a very early commencement; yet in that speech honourable members will find what is practically a forecast of the defence system as we have it to-day. The present Attorney-General on that occasion declared that we must defend ourselves, T h a t is only an assertion. and it is wonderful how he foretold what has taken place during the war in various parts of the world. The honourable member for West Sydney on this question of defence was then in opposition to many members of his own party; indeed, there were times when he was almost mobbed by electors outside this chamber. The fact is that in this connection he was a long way in advance of his party at the commencement of Federation; but his speech outlined unmistakably our present universal system of training on land, and, without specifying any particular class of vessels, showed the necessity for some naval force to take the place of the I do not propose to British squadron in Australian waters. member for Corio, was really the first to make the suggestion. earlier proposals of the kind I shall be glad to listen to h i m ; but I do not think that any one was before the honourable member for West Sydney.

Of course, it is quite likely that after I hear the honourable member for Angas-wh o was Minister for External Affairsi n the Cook GovernmentI may modify my opinion; but it appears to me that the agreement is very much in favour of Vestey Brothers as against the Commonwealth, or, what is more important still, as against the future producers and cattle-raisers of the",41,Supply Bill No 3

The first paragraph of the agreement referring to the conditions saysThe said company shall be incorporated under the Companies Acts of the United Kingdom, or of the Commonwealth, or of any State or Territory of the Commonwealth, for the purpose of taking over the said works and the rights and obligations of the contractor under these presents: . . . . In my opinion that paragraph is vague, and apparently gives to the firm the right to register under any Companies A ct that may be suitable to them. In some of the States there are Companies Acts on which I do not place much reliance, though in other States the law has been brought somewhat up to date. A t present there is no Commonwealth Companies Act, and my fear is that in this paragraph of the agreement may be found a loop-hole which will allow this wealthy English company to register under an A ct which would not give the Commonwealth very much control. In the same paragraph of the agreement we find it set forth that the capital of the company shall not be less than £100,000, and thatThere shall be a condition in the memorandum of association of the said company that a majority of the shares in the said company shall always bo held by British subjects. Only recently we have read how some companies are formed in Australia, and we do not know but that the British subjects who hold the shares may not be in collusion with the subjects of some other country, particularly of the United States of America. I am anxious to know whether Vestey Brothers have any connection with the Meat Trust as we know it . row Wilson declared that he was going to k ill the Meat Trusti n America by throwing down the Protectionist barriers, and thus allow free competition, but the Meat Trust, which can legislate even before the Legislature, made due provision. went to other countries, and set up in business, so that when the Protectionist -barriers were thrown down in America millions of pounds weight of Australian and other meat were sent over to the United States, and sold under the auspices of the Trusti n the same old way. As a layman, the agreement appears to me to be altogether in away their frozen meat themselves. favour of Vestey Brothers, with their large business at Smithfield, where, I may say, the American Meat Trust also has some fifty establishments. There is nothing to insure that there is no connection between the firm and the Trust. competitors of the Trust. have seen firms flying at one another's throats one month, and the next month hanging on one another's necks. This has been the history of companies in Victoria, New South Wales, and Australia generally, and particularly in America; wherever competition proves disastrous to the competitors, they come to an arrangement to share the profits. Then, again, in the agreement certain specified charges are set forth in connection with the freezing of stock belonging to other persons than Vestey Brothers. This is to be doneat the average price from time to time charged for similar services at private meat works in tropical Australia (that is to say, at meat works situated north of the parallel 23 degrees 27 minutes), together with any addition to, and subject to any deduction from, such price which may be agreed upon from time to time between the Administrator and the contractor This, I take to mean, that the charges are to be the same as those at works at and about Rockhampton, or further North. The Administrator may be a very good man in certain respects, but I question whether he is a fit and proper person to determine the conditions governing the operations of a big company like this in the Northern Territory. This is too large a matter to be settled even by a Government. The agreement It is not dead. Woodshould have been submitted to the Parliament for discussion and the suggestion of amendments. If the producers in the Northern Territory are to be protected, we shall have to do for them what has been done in Victoria, New South Wales, and other States; the Government must It came to Australia, and look after freezing and export operations.

A clause of the agreement would lead one to believe that the company is to obtain no concessionThe contractor shall not, in any circumstances, claim, or be entitled to, any grant, contribution, payment, or assistance by or from the Government towards the cost of the said works. Althoughi t would thus appear that the company is to receive no concession, it is specified that the Commonwealth shall make improvements to the jetty, bore for water ito give the company a water supply, charge railway freights in accordance with the North Queensland railway freights, extend the railway from Pine Creek to Katherine River, and lease to the company 160,000 acres at the rail head and at Glencoe. trol of the passed out of the hands of the Government, and rests almost exclusively, so far as the enforcement of the main provisions of the agreement is concerned, in those of the Administrator.

I wish to know whether the ex-Minister of External Affairs absolutely satisfied himself that there is no connection between Sir William Vestey and the American Meat Trust.

The fact that a certain proportion of this company's shares must be held by British subjects does not make the position satisfactory. I have a strong suspicion that there is a connection between the company and the American Meat Trust. The company has a lot of land in the Northern Territory, and the agreement will give it a still larger area. The conI t has also properties in the north-east of company has almost Western Australia. Vast tracts of country are owned or leased by it , and it possesses nearly 200,000 head of cattle. To hand over the Northern Territory to a company associated with the American Meat Trust would be disastrous to settlement there. If the honourable member for Angas is able to disabuse my mind of the suspicions which I entertain, I shall be very pleased. I made it , and take f u l l the company with the American Meat Trust without evidence in support of the I hope to hear the connection ? An y person who deciation which there may be, I say that too much power has been given to this company. It seems to me that competition is shut out for all time.

That is to be provided by outside freezers as well as the company. The company will be in a position to control the cattle business and the export trade of the Northern Territory-a t least, that is my reading of the agreement. T am sorry that the last Government did not bring the proposed agreement before Parliament. Had that been done, the agreement would not have been made in the form in which it was drafted.

447,Mr Glynn,"in the revenue. I found pastoral settlement absolutely stagnant. In the Victoria River district, which is the country to be connected with the freezing works, there were only 13 lessees, who were paying a rental of about £2,000 a year, and I think the area held was something like 38,000 square miles. Amongst other holders were Vestey Brothers, who had recently acquired in open market a considerable area of leased country which gave them a total holding of some 14,000 square miles out of the total of 38,000 square miles. There was no easy means of getting Victoria River cattle to market. There was a strong probability, and almost a certainty, that the Western Australian Government would establish freezing works at Wyndham, and if that had been done it would have been a bad thing, for, at all events, the bulk of the lessees in the Victoria country. I may tell honourable members opposite that I read the terms which the Labour Government in Western Australia, it was said, were offering to private people to build freezing works in Western Australia, and they were more liberal than I have given. What did we do? I found that my predecessor had put an amount of £25,000 on the Estimates towards freezing works that would cost at least £200,000. You cannot possibly carry on freezing works unless you have cattle stations tied up with those works. What had been done by my predecessor in office in this respect? There were not 5,000 cattle a year tied up with the freezing works. We are now getting built by Vestey Brothers in the Northern Territory, freezing works which will accommodate at least 30,000 cattle a year, and Vestey Brothers alone are capable of keeping those works going. I say that it was not sound administration on the part of those who preceded us to set about establishing freezing works before they had contracts definitelv enabling them to keep those works going. I asked my colleagues, if I failed to make a satisfactory arrangement with private persons, to restore the provision of £25,000 towards the erection of freezing works. going to build the works for £25,000? That amount was a vote towards the cost of building them. going to build the works ourselves, and not hand them over to private people. I have pointed out that there were not enough cattle tied up by agreement to enable the works to be fully carried on. We may have been political Micawbers, waiting for something to turn up which we had not provided for, but that something had not turned up, and nothing substantial had been done to bind some of the stations to send cattle to the works. I had an opportunity through other companies of establishing freezing works there. I did see some gentlemen who may or may not have been connected with some of the trusts. There was one gentleman who came out from Armour and Company, in England. I saw him, and I am not sure whether Armour and Company, in England, is dissociated from Armour and Company, of New York. I had reasons for suspicion as to what their relations were, but I did not act on suspicion. My colleagues and I obtained from Sir George Reid a report running into 200 pages of foolscap, which will give the honourable member for Maribyrnong more accurate information than he now possesses if he cares to study that document. I believe it 'is in the hands of the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the members of the Government party will find in it all the information as to who really are the three or four firms who boss the meat trade in the Old Country. Brothers. One firm has a name that smells of a German proprietary; but its connection is not clear. We know the extent to which the evil of the Meat Trust exists in England, and the possibility that may exist of its extension to Australia. I told the gentleman from Armour and Company that I would not deal with his firm. the name. I might have been right, or I might have been wrong, but there was a fear of the Meat Trust in Australia, and unless I was absolutely sure of what I was doing I was determined to take no risk. Who are Vestey Brothers? I made inquiry from the High Commissioner's office, and from other sources. I already knew something about them.

455,Mr Glynn,"Becaus e I did not likeEnglish financial papers, and read their recent re-arrangements. They own about forty-seven meat works throughout the world-the y or The Union Cool Storage Company, of which they are the controlling shareholders. They are some of the biggest meat dealers resident in the British Empire, and amongst the biggest in the world. They are an English firm, and it is stated to me that the Vestey Brothers are the strongest barriers against the methods of the Meat Trust in England. They are Englishmen who are trying to keep the English market. free. They are not mixed up in any way with obnoxious operations in Smithfield. I do not wish to mention names in the House at present, because the document has not been published, but there is a large portion of that report from the High Commissioner which could be put on the tabltf of the House at any time. It is not confidential, and honourable members who peruse it will see who are the parties who are beginning to control the meat industry in England. I say that they are not Vestey Brothers. to 200 pages of foolscap you may be sure it will not be read. mediately it was received, and I then handed it to my colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, who, I think, also read it. The honourable member for Maribyrnong first threw out a suspicion on Vestey Brothers, by attempting, without evidence, to associate them with the Meat Trust. Then he objects that there is some suspicion about the formation of the company. They need not form a company. Vestey Brothers are the contractors, and are bound, by the provisions of their agreement, and all the conditions say is that, if they do form a company, we will permit the transfer of the interests they have acquired to the company, which must be incorporated, if not under the English law, under whatever law operates in the Northern Territory. The law that operates there is the Commonwealth law, and if we choose to pass a uniform companies law, they must come under that. All we ask is that the company he incorporated under some British Act. ""We can control them no matter what Act they are under. Parliament could to-morrow morning pass an Act modifying the conditions of incorporation under the agreement, no matter what Act the company are incorporated under. say we could pass a uniform Companies Act? panies Act, but not a thoroughly comprehensive one; there are difficulties in the Constitution. But we can pass an Act for the Territory. We have absolute power as regards the Territory, and we are now dealing with the Territory only. The next point which the honourable member for Maribyrnong took up was the concessions given to the company. What concessions were given ? Absolutely none. Any one can start freezing works in the Territory to-morrow. No monopoly is given. We have given Vestey Brothers the right to take up leaseholds under existing Ordinances, and I refused to give them anything beyond what Parliament had sanctioned. All that we promised to do was to facilitate their getting these lands. railhead and at Glencoe. them to get land as holding ground in the vicinity of the works and at the point of shipment. thousand acres is not a big area in any case. some of the .holdings which honourable members of the Labour party took up along the route of the transcontinental railway. which the land is taken up are provided in the Ordinance which the Labour party framed. All I promised to do was to facilitate their getting those areas where they would be effective for the purposes for which they are intended. They are held under a perpetual leasing system in some cases, and in others on the terms of pastoral or miscellaneous lease. The honourable member has referred to the question of a concession of railway rates. What is the nature of that concession? We merely declare what rates shall be charged for five years. It took me nearly two months before I was satisfied that they were fair rates.

The rates fixed upon were the minimum Queensland rate of 9s. 2d. per head of cattle, with a maximum of, I think, lis. 6d. I was informed that it was not intended in Queensland to raise the rates beyond 9s. 2d -honorabl e members will see that I was not sleeping on the matter-bu t if the Queensland rates are raised our rates will also go up to the maximum prescribed. member says that we made no provision for the treatment of the cattle of private owners. Isi t not a great stroke to compel a firm spending their own money on the erection of freezing works to give up part of their space to other lessees? Not only that; if at any time they do not use any of their space, the whole of that space not used must be devoted to the use of outside lessees. They must give up, if required, at least one-third of their space to outside lessees. I am afraid, however, that it will be some years before other lessees will be in a position to use that amount of space.

When we were dealing with this matter I telegraphed for Dr. Gilruth, and when he came to Melbourne I had the advantage of his co-operation and knowledge during several weeks of very keen negotiations in regard to this and other matters. The honourable member referred to the fact that any one wishing to send cattle to the freezing works must give reasonable notice-si x months in some cases. And why not? Should a man be permitted to send in cattle for treatment without notice ? very carefully considered. It was not a case of the head of a Department bring-, ing a matter to the Minister for his approval. The files show the extent of the negotiations. For five months the matter was given most careful scrutiny. There were objections to this and to that, and there were amendments suggested by the one side and then by the However, I have other side.

487,The Chairman,"The honorableMinister and Treasurer) [S.55] -The following message has just been received, and I take this opportunity of reading it:Following further particulars from company's doctor Ollerhead, returned from Keeling, reports "" Emden's captain unwounded, prisoner; Kaiser's nephew also unwounded; about 200 killed; about thirty wounded taken off Emden. Some remaining Keeling. Will bo picked up by ship returning from Cocos."" Nothing seen Ayesha. Island will be visited frequently while uncaptured. Sydney sunk Emden's collier as flooded prior capture. There has also been an appreciative, sympathetic, and patriotic resolution passed by the Legislature of Queensland, to which we shall suitably reply. regret that the practice followed on the hustings of each side attempting to take credit for the establishment of our defence system has been continued in this chamber. To me it is immaterial who started the great forces upon which we are relying. There are large bodies of both parties who were keen on Australian defence, and there are others who have been adverse to any effective defence steps being taken. I wish to add the weight of my opinion in the matter of providing pensions for those who, as a result of going to the front, may leave behind them children and others dependent upon them. There should not be the slightest hesitation, on the part of the Government to make adequate provision for possible widows and orphans, the result of the great war in which we are engaged. I also think that it would be wise for the Government to take a hand in controlling the huge Patriotic Funds that are being accumulated. There have been many rumours about questionable control of similar funds that have existed in the past. I do not say that there is any danger of that now, while every one is keenly patriotic and careful to see that the right thing is done, but as time goes on, possibly when the war is over, this enthusiasm may wane, and there will not be so much care exercised. A trust should be appointed to take charge of these funds, and see that they are suitably applied in the direction of. making adequate provision in the shape of pensions to those who are wounded and those who have dependent survivors. I wish to refer to the attitude of the Government in regard to dry canteens. I am well aware that adverse comment on the action taken renders one open to the imputation from many eminently respectable citizens and many good people of lacking moral fibre and a sense of decency in combating the assumption that everything tending to total abstinence should be encouraged. However, I do combat the said assumption, not because I have any less respect for the sober man or less contempt for the drunken man than has the honourable member for Brisbane. It seems to me that the honourable member is eaten up with a commendable zeal, and a zeal without which, no doubt, very much good work in this world could not be accomplished. A t the same time, I think that if it were not for the wisdom of wiser people in many cases the efforts of the good would not result in anything like that which is desired by even themselves. I fear that the efforts of the honourable member and his friends will bring about their own reprisals. Added to the general desire that people shall reform, there is also the sub-conscious tendency toCompound for sins they are inclined to, By damning those they have no mind to. I do not suggest that the honourable member for Brisbane has any sins that he would like to condone, but there can be no doubt that this, after all, is a human tendency. I fear a reaction will follow the efforts to suppress all traffic in drink, whether inside or outside our canteens. The trouble is that men who are probably in the habit of taking a little drink when away from the camp, and "" off the leash,"" so to speak, may indulge too freely, chiefly because they have had no drink for some time. That is one of the reactionary effects which I foresee in regard to dry canteens. Prohibition in other quarters has not had all the good results that our honourable friend would have us believe. According to the statistics, the importation of stimulants into New Zealand during the prohibition period is larger than it was before. That is not necessarily conclusive proof that more strong drink is being consumed than was the case before, but it certainly conveys such a suggestion. We cannot lose sight of the fact that prohibition means driving tradeunderground; it means illicit traffic.",49,Smith I Think We Had Member For Wimmera Can Point To Any
488,Mr Fisher (Wide Bay,Prime,50,Smith I Think We Had Member For Wimmera Can Point To Any
489,Mr Carr (Macquarie) [8.57],"INo one will say that if the rank and file are denied their beer, those who are in a position to acquire it by some means will do without it. In such circumstances, those who were supposed to uphold the law would not always do so, and even if the law prohibited the traffic altogether, I think that strong drink would still be acquired by some. military canteens are under official control; they are supervised by officers who spend their lives in keeping others up tc the mark, whose one function it is to inculcate discipline and to secure the strict observance of rules and regulations. If , in such circumstances, the drink traffic in our camps cannot be administered satisfactorily, one must feel inclined to abandon all hope. I am quite satisfied, however, that we are more likely to secure effective control over our men inside our canteens than in public houses. I would, therefore, much prefer to know that our soldiers were obtaining what drink they required under properly regulated conditions instead of in a haphazard, illicit way, and getting questionable brands as well as undue quantities. Many of these men are probably going ""to lay down their lives for tlieir country. Many of them have been in the habit of taking some alcoholic refreshment, and, for the most part, they are moderate drinkers. If their supply is to be absolutely cut off, we shall have a great deal of dissatisfaction and discontent which we would do well not to engender. There are many practical considerations in favour of the canteen in camp rather than having our soldiers supplied by irresponsible persons outside, or obtaining illicit supplies within the camp itself. have to provide, in respect of their bread There are very substantial reasons for permitting the old system to obtain, and for refusing to adhere to the lines laid down by the honourable member for Brisbane. hearing the many speeches to which we have listened to-night regarding the authorship of the Australian Navy, I feel constrained to say that I am interested, not so much in the question of who is entitled to claim credit for the initiation of the Navy as in that of the proper upkeep of the Navy as we have it to-day. An examination of our responsibilities in this respect has led me into several interesting investigations, and a large field for careful study, more particularly in regard to the food supplies of the men whom we are sending to the front, is opened up. From the reply that I received to a question which I addressed to the Prime Minister to-day with regard to the proposal to borrow money to be handed over to the States, I am inclined to the opinion that the right The honourable gentleman regarded my inquiry as a rather hostile one. I am sorry that he is not in the chamber just now, for I desired to assure him that in putting the question I had absolutely no hostile intent. Having looked carefully into the position, I find one or two remarkable situations arising from the present unfortunate drought troubles of Australia, and I believe that if the Prime Minister had been perfectly acquainted with the actual position he would not have regarded my suggestion from a hostile point of view. I am assuming, first of all, for the sake of argument, that we shall have to work up to the ultimate number of men that many people in Australia expect us to put into the field in the defence of ourselves and the Empire, and that is no fewer than 100,000. The question naturally arises, ""How are they to be fed?"" Whilst we may be very anxious to know what their equipment is to be, it is idle to talk about their clothing, and so forth, if we do not give them the necessary material wherewith to maintain body and soul. A most important factor in dealing with a number of men at the front is to see that their food supplies are kept well up to them. I find that if we do ultimately place 100,000 men in the field, we shall alone, no less than 1,666 bushels of wheat per day. I search in vain for any part of Australia that is likely, in the near future, to be able to supply that demand. I am under an obligation to Mr Knibbs, the Commonwealth Statistician, who has given me some of the latest figures in his keeping with respect to this question. We are in a rather precarious position in the Commonwealth owing, not to war, but to something that is really more dreadful to us here, and that is the drought over which, unfortunately, we have no control. We read in many of the newspapers that New South Wales hopes this year to have a wheat yield of 20,000,000 bushels, but, as a practical man, I have no hesitation",50,Smith I Think We Had Member For Wimmera Can Point To Any

I practically concentrated the whole of my desires in this respect in the question that I addressed today to the Prime Minister. I asked the right honourable gentleman if it was proposed to impose any conditions regarding the use of the money borrowed for the States-whethe r the primary producers throughout Australia might expect to receive some slight benefit from the amount of money that would then be let loose. The reply I received was that, if the money loaned to the States were devoted to a public works policy, other financial activities would probably be left open for the particular class of producers I desired to see assisted. Chanter, know, as well as I do, that a large number of our primary producers in New South Wales will require substantial financial assistance before they will see their way clear to go on with protions insisting upon some assistance being ducing operations during 1915. to obtain that assistance from the honourable member's friends-the private banks. not lend money on a certain tenure which the honourable member and his brother Labour men in several States have brought into existence, and which is commonly known as the leasehold system. be obtained in Queensland on leasehold securities. pleased to hear it ; but that statement, I am sorry to say, does not apply to New South Wales. able member always supporting the private banks? vate banks is not available for the class' for whom I desire to secure assistance. While I admit that there are difficulties in the way, I was pleased to hear the ex-Treasurer draw the attention of the Prime Minister to one method by which, in his opinion, the States might be induced to take into consideration this very matter. The Commonwealth, I think, might impose a condition that a certain amount of the money loaned to the States should be used to assist those engaged in the production of our food stuffs, who need financial assistance. from the honourable member! tioneering speeches in which the cry of the Liberals was "" Leave us alone."" anything unreasonable. I am simply urging that this borrowed money should be spread as far as possible over every industry, and should not necessarily be limited to one particular class of activities. requires the Commonwealth to take a risk that the private banks will not take. You, Mr for anything unreasonable. I merely urge that if the Commonwealth is prepared to borrow this money from the Imperial Government, or from some other source, we should impose some condigiven to necessitous farmers. I should like to know, in the first place, whether the Imperial Government, if they are lending this money, are prepared to advance it for public works only. Of course I have only the press reports to rely on, but it is said that the States intend to use the money for this purpose, as, for instance, in New South Wales, where it is to be devoted to the construction of railways and activities of that sort. But what is the good of building a railway line if , when it is built, there is no produce to carry?

If this year there is only sufficient wheat to provide our own bread and seed, what will be the position next year if a large number of our producers are in such financial straits that they cannot carry on operations?

I should say that, if we have enough seed and flour for the whole of the Commonwealth, we shall do very well indeed with our present crop. But what about next year? I am very sorry indeed to have to make observations of this kind in regard to my brother farmers, hut I know the conditions under which they are suffering, and I have intense sympathy with them. Honourable members opposite, who are always prating so much about their humanitarian attitude ""prating "" because of the hostile interjections that I have experienced. started out to deal with the subject from the point of view of the food supply for the Navy and Expeditionary Forces. The state of affairs at the other side of the world requires that we should do supply of our kith and kin here and in all parts of the Empire. panies that are continually raising the prices of foodstuffs ? from that point of view, and I regard that as a hostile interjection. According to the latest statistics supplied by Mr Knibbs, Great Britain and Ireland require 276,000,000 bushels of wheat per year, and hitherto the supply has come from British East India, the United States of America, Canada, Argentine, Russia, Australia, Roumania, Chili, New Zealand, and quite a number of other places, some of which, owing to the war, are now "" out of action."" In 1913 Great Britain imported 35,000,000 bushels from the British East Indies, 63,000,000 bushels from the United States, 40,000,000 bushels from Canada, 27,000,000 bushels from Argentine, and 18,000,000 bushels from Australiaa total of 183,000,000. Great Britain and Ireland supplied 56,000,000, bringing the figure up to 239,000,000, and leaving a deficit of 35,000,000 bushels of wheat. This deficit last year was made up by imported flour and wheat from other countries which to-day are at war, and next year will themselves need all the wheat that is raised, and then, probably, they will have a very small loaf. We Cannot hope next year to see the Empire supplied as it was in 1913, if for no other reason than that, to begin with, there will not be the 18,000,000 from Australia. Under the circumstances we should, to the best of our power and ability, safeguard those industries which supply the br^ad of tbe British Dominions; and to that end I submit that we ought to assist those producers in Australia who, owing to circumstances over which they have no control, now find themselves in dire necessity. If the producing industries are kept going, then all the dependent industries would continue normal; but some honourable members opposite, losing sight of the true position, propose that we should limit the assistance I to the wrong end of the line, namely, the public works of the States.",52,Smith I Think We Had Member For Wimmera Can Point To Any

That honourable member mentioned a Melbourne newspaper of somewhat Conservative tendency, and insisted on identif y i ng honourable members on thSs side with the attitude of that newspaper on the question of the creation of a NavalU n it for Australia. I wish to give him a Roland for his Oliver. If the honourable member chooses to identify members on this side with particular newspapers, he cannot take exception if I identify a certain section of the Labour party with opinions expressed on this matter by the leading Labour organ, the Worker. what I am about to quote did not, even at that time, represent the opinions of any considerable number of Labour members, in this House, and I am sure that it does not represent the opinions of of the Labour platform when it became any of them at the present time. I read the quotation, however, as an indication that when the question of an Australian U n it was being discussed an influential section of the Labour movement, outside the House to a large extent, took anything but the national view that an Australian Navy was essential to the Commonwealth. When this particular matter was becoming a very live question, tlie Sydney Worker, on' the 13th February. 1909, published an article from which I propose to read one or two extracts. It indicated that the question was one which must be considered free from the "" cant of patriotism."" Only a short time ago we had a section of the people-mostl y on the Labour side-whic h sneered at the idea of patriotism. If the war has done nothing else, it has brought back to the peopleof this part of the Empire the old The Worker gave the credit for the Navy idea of patriotism. is dealing with matters which might well be left alone at this juncture. ter and his friends are allowed to claim that they alone are entitled to all the credit for the creation of the Australian Navy, everything is right and proper, but they consider it wrong to mention that there is another point of view. It is quite right for an honourable member on the Government side to identify honourable members of the Opposition with certain opinions expressed by a Conservative newspaper, but quite wrong for me to quote opinions expressed by the principal Labour organ in Australia. When an attempt is made to place me in a false position, I am not going to remain silent. The Worker article statedTo half the British population, then, there would be nothing to lose. There might be something to gain by the setting up of a German Government to match the German dynasty on the throne. The writer sneers at the idea of an Australian NavyAustralia is going to have a Navy, only, it is true, a little bit of a thing that Australia will be able to carry about in its lunch bag, and amuse itself with floating in a basin, but the beginning of a Navy, nevertheless. ence in 1908 the establishment of an Australian-owned and controlled Navy was made a plank of the Labour platform. a vital part of the policy of the Empire. I am willing to give honourable members opposite their proper share of the credit for the defence preparations of Australia, but I protest against the claim that they have repeatedly made during the last few weeks, and which I have read in the newspapers, that they are entitled to all the credit for the establishment of the Australian Navy. The article in the Worker continuesThe Federal Government has decided to spend £250,000 in the inauguration of this novel project, and two destroyers are to be ordered forthwith, to protect the coast and commerce of Australia, and strike terror into that little brown beast, Japan, to say nothing of incidentally acting as a warning to Kaiser Bill to be very careful and mind what he is about in the future. The heart of Fat is rejoiced. He has wanted a Navy all along. to the "" f a t man "" He is always in favour of spending the national wealth in the protection of his wealth.

What a dreadful thing it would be if the Japs or the Germans came over here and invaded the sanctity of our slums. . . .

It is not very long since it was the correct thing in some quarters to incite in the minds of Australians hostility and contempt foT England and the English. Those who did so are now only too glad to read of the English Johnny shedding his blood to protect them. They have come into line with those old-fashioned folk who believe in national patriotism, and who are convinced that the race has the pluck to fight to a triumphant finish in this war. compliment the Prime Minister on the adoption as part of his policy of the agreement between the Commonwealth and the States for the settlement of the Murray Waters question, which has agitated the minds of the people of Australia for the past forty years. But I regret exceedingly that the right honourable gentleman has declared that we must wait until the State Parliaments have ratified the agreement entered into by the State Premiers before we can deal with it . It has been our boast that we are prepared, as the Parliament of Australia, to pass the legislation needed in the interests of Australia. Why in this case should we wait for the lead of the Parliaments of the States? It will be clearly a dereliction of our duty if we do not at the earliest moment discharge our responsibilities under the agreement. Since Federation was established fourteen years ago, this is the first real opportunity that the Parliament has had to approve of a scheme of a purely developmental character for the benefit of every section of the community. act as soon as the States concerned have done their duty. pass the legislation we are pledged to pass. Australia is now faced with the most disastrous drought in its history. gation works already carried out along sands of sheep have been saved by the fying the agreement with the States we set an example to tfie State Parliaments, and produce a moral influence which should compel them to do their duty in this matter. The Commonwealth has undertaken to provide £1,000,000 for the construction of locks and other important works on the Murray, and the States are to co-operate. It is impossible to determine exactly the benefits which will result from the carrying out of the enterprise. We know that already some 300,000 acres are under irrigation in the three States which are parties to the agreement, and that when effect has been given to the agreement, some 1,500,000 acres more. will be available for intense cultivation. land? areas of Crown land and also large areas of private land which could be repurchased. In New South Wales' large areas of land have been repurchased for closer settlement in connection with the Burrinjuck scheme. At Mildura 12,000 acres of irrigated land give a return which averages £30 per acre per annum. On that basis, 1,500,000 acres of irrigated land would yield annually £45,000,000. On a dairying basis, allowing a cow to every acre put under lucerne, and a return of £10 per annum from each cow, the gross return would be £15,000,000.

[9.55] I am not going to detain the Committee very long, nor would I have risen at all but for the statements of the honourable member for Wimmera and the honourable member who preceded him. I agree with the honourable member for Wimmera that this question of the Murray waters is one that should concern the whole of Australia. If .the question of water conservation and irrigation is not a national one, it is hard to find a question that is. I would suggest to the honourable member for Maranoa that this question concerns Queensland as well as any other part of Australia. The agreement to which reference has been made was framed by the party opposite when they were in office, and I would remind the honourable member for Wimmera that it was in his power last year to have compelled the Government he was supporting to give statutory effect to the agreement. That party had a majority of one, and it was in the hands of any one gentleman sitting in support of lue Government to nave compelled them to take action in connection with the agreement. pelled the Senate? That question never got as far as the Senate.'

My impression is that the sooner we get this Bill through the House, the better chance we shall have of getting it through the States. However, I am not criticizing the Prime Minister, but am merely explaining the facts. As to the other statements by honourable members opposite, fortunately the facts are on record. Our Navy is in existence. It is nobody's special navy. Why, therefore, cannot we give each other a little credit for having called that Navy into existence? Why are these party aspects dragged in every time the matter comes up for discussion, despite the statements of the Prime Minister outside ? If we are going to legislate on non-party lines, let us adhere strictly to those lines. There ought to be no party lines connected with this war, or with the preparations that have to be made to see it through. I appeal to honourable members to cease these party interjections, to desist, once and for all, from adopting a party attitude in everything relating to the Australian Navy, and to the defence of our Empire. would not have risen but for the reference of the ex-Prime Minister to the Agricultural Bureau Bill.

I trust that the Postmaster-General will adopt my suggestion, and. inquire into the possibility of developing the vast and profitable deposits of clay which we have in Australia. I wish now to refer to the payments we are making to the troops we are sending abroad. I agree that the Bill to provide for pensions should beintroduced as soon as possible, so that we may know what provision the Government propose to make for those who may lose their breadwinners on the battle-field. But there is a duty still nearer home, and it relates to the wives and children of those who have gone abroad. I understand that the soldiers receive 5s. per day. also Is. per day deferred pay. Is. per day is of no use to the men now. I was interviewed to-day by the wife of a soldier who has gone to the front, and was told that she had six children. She said that she was receiving 4s. 6d. per day. That was the provision which her husband had made for her support; ""and if he is receiving only 5s. per day I think Under this order, sergeant-majors and! he has done his best for her. She has rent to pay, and how can she hope to maintain her six children decently on such an allowance? I am informed that one officer is receiving £1,500 a year, and are no better men connected with our an allowance of 15B. per day. I do not know what the allowance is for, seeing that, while an board ship, all his wants will be supplied. His allowance is three times greater than the pay received by the men in the ranks. If we want to induce 100,000 men to volunteer, we must see that adequate provision is made for' those whom they leave behind. lies ought not to be sent. that question now. Many men so situated were loth to leave their wives and children; but, realizing the danger of the Empire, they thought it their doty to volunteer, and the least we can do is to [21]2 see that their wives and little ones are not allowed to want. the large funds that have been raised t these people to depend on charity. We have vast resources, and we ought to see that the wives and children of ou*soldiers are provided for. ance will be made out of the Victoriac patriotic fund for such a purpose. much about that. My contention is tiiat we should make adequate provision for the wives and children of those who have gone to the front, and I trust that the Assistant Minister of Defence will ascertain whether an increased payment cannot be made. There is only one other matter to which I shall refer, and it relates to the positions vacated by officers who have volunteered to go to the front. I was promised by the Minister that non-. commissioned officers would have an opportunity to apply for these commissions, and certain regulations were cancelled to afford them that opportunity. In the latest district orders issued to the Military Forces, however-District Order No. 54-w e have this statementApplications are invited from the militia officers on theactive, unattached, reserve,, and retired lists, for appointment as brigade-major (temporarily) 18th Infantry Brigade, and Brigade Area, 3rd Military District, to reach District Head-quarters not later than 1st November, 1014. other non-commissioned officers are debarred from applying for higher .positions in the Force than they now occupy. I consider that that is most unfair. ThereForces. There was a regulation in force giving priority in jegard to appointments to quite a number of people, such, as retired Imperial soldiers and reservists, and, to a certain extent, disqualifying non-commissioned officers of our Forces from applying for promotion. I brought this under the notice of the.. Minister of Defence, and he immediatelyordered that those regulations should be cancelled. They were cancelled, and I was informed that non-commissioned officers could apply for higher positions than they at present hold.
