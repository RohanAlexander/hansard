This is the end of the Calder Highway, which is a major arterial road that links not only the north-western suburbs of Melbourne to the central part of Melbourne but also very large tracts of rural Victoria, particularly the region up to Bendigo and beyond to Mildura. It is a very important freeway road link for the whole of north-western Victoria. The Calder Highway has been recognised by the Commonwealth and state governments as a road of national importance. In fact, in 1996 it was the first road of national importance designated in Victoria. According to the web site produced by the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Services, the Commonwealth and the state since 1996 have committed $195.7 million to the much needed and very welcome upgrading of this highway. However, once it gets to Melbourne, it becomes a car park. Once it reaches the Tullamarine Freeway, traffic grinds to a halt. So one would have to doubt the efficiency of a great deal of that expenditure. Without upgrading the interchange so that traffic can flow without being caught up in a car park situation approaching central Melbourne, it remains dangerous, inefficient and uneconomical. The estimate that has been given to remodel the intersection is some $250 million. It is adjacent to Essendon airport. Essendon airport operators have indicated a willingness to provide land required for the interchange to be upgraded. Transurban, which is the company that operates CityLink, may well be willing to contribute funding to an upgrade so that the travel times that are incurred by traffic feeding into its system are improved. I call on the Commonwealth and the state governments to very quickly recognise-particularly in the lead-up to the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, because this will be the major gateway into Melbourne for Commonwealth Games visitors-that this interchange, as an extension of the Calder’s road of national importance status, needs upgrading. They need to ensure that the standards of service are improved, that economic efficiency is enhanced, that road safety is improved, and that the great losses that have been incurred by not only residents of the north-west of Melbourne, whom I represent, but also people right throughout country Victoria as far away as Mildura, are set to right and they have a rapidly improved capacity to get access to Melbourne.

198,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (9.43 A.m.),"Two Sundays ago I attended a community rally at thewould have been there, but, no, she was not. Now that Labor has firmly put its airport position into policy, this threat will hang over the heads of Southern Highlands residents for a long time. Even the Labor transport spokesman has admitted its plans have more to do with Labor Party stability and unity than decent transport planning. It is about taking Wilton off the agenda to appease the Labor held electorates around Wollongong. No-one is denying that, particularly not Labor’s candidate for Gilmore in the forthcoming federal election. She is silent on the matter and has conveniently put aside her own environmental conscience to allow political will to prevail. If she truly wanted to represent the people of Gilmore, she should have been there, attacking her party for even considering this preposterous suggestion or, at the very least, meeting residents instead of staying away. What this decision says is that the Labor Party does not care about rural constituents. When their candidate eventually goes up to the Southern Highlands saying, ‘Vote for me; I care for you,’ how is that going to sound? When I heard the announcement my immediate thought was that it had to be a joke; however, it is not and the issue needs to be taken seriously. It is this type of announcement that I would expect from someone wanting to take the heat out of another embarrassing issue. This harebrained proposal has got to be stopped. If it is not, somewhere along the line it will become entrenched. Already it has attained the status of a policy. The next step is to lend credence to the policy by investing time and money into exploring its viability. Who knows what could flow from this process? Given past experiences with Labor policy, I fear the worse. The other tactic Labor use is to announce something so patently horrible that any alternative is seen as a relief, so even if they do not go ahead with the airport proposal, what else have they got in mind? Sutton Forest is well and truly on the political map now and Southern Highlands residents have every right to be concerned. With proposals like this floating around, what will happen to the value of the family home? I challenge the Gilmore Labor candidate to come out strongly on this and take on her political masters. If she stays silent on the matter, she is giving her tacit approval to destroying the quality of life for the residents of Sutton Forest in particular and the Southern Highlands in general. She says she has not made up her mind and that she wants to listen to their concerns. Where was she to hear those concerns when they were being voiced? The Labor candidate for Gilmore really just does not want to know. Calwell Electorate: Community Radio Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (9.46 a.m.)-This coming SaturdayI will be attending a very special function in my electorate of Calwell. One of our community radio stations-and I am pleased to say that in Calwell we have three community radio stations-Bulla FM will be rebadged and relaunched as community radio 3NRG at its new premises, the Derek Rigby Room at the Sunbury Campus of Victoria University. Community radio, first called public radio, has played a major role in Australian media. First established some 30 years ago when the Whitlam government ended the dominance of entrenched commercial radio by introducing a third tier of broadcasting known as the FM band, community radio is about ordinary people and communities getting together to produce programs that are of local interest and about giving the opportunity for an independent voice to be heard on Australian airwaves. Community radio is a non-profit organisation which relies almost exclusively on the good work and commitment of volunteers and which has evolved MAIN COMMITTEE over the years into a much valued resource, becoming the largest growth sector in the Australian media industry. In fact, at the beginning of March 2003, there were 200 licensed community radio stations around Australia with some 150 waiting to be licensed. Like the local newspaper, community radio becomes part of the community and offers the local content that commercial radio is not interested in providing. Commercial radio has, by withdrawing from local services and content, made the role of community radio more important than ever. I have spoken in this place before about the benefits of ethnic community radio stations and have referred to my own experience in broadcasting as a volunteer with 3ZZZ community radio. Community radio enjoys grassroots support and provides a forum and voice for a diversity of groups and interests including religious, Indigenous, student, youth and alternative minorities. In the same spirit and tradition of community radio, Bulla FM-soon to be radio 3NRGbased in a region in Melbourne’s north-west suburbs, is a community station for Melbourne’s fringe and outlying areas. Over the last 10 years of the station’s history it has served a changing and rapidly growing community made up of major centres like Sunbury and smaller dispersed rural towns like Bulla, Wildwood, Diggers Rest, Clarkefield and much of the outlying regions of the Hume City Council. Programming on the station covers a wide range of musical styles, including jazz, country, heavy metal and contemporary music. It is also a key information source for local matters, events and services and, with close to 10,000 kids under the age of 18 in Sunbury, its youth program is a key focus for the many young people to get involved and have some fun and also to take the opportunity to acquire valuable skills and to develop their confidence and give expression to their creativity. The relaunch on Saturday is not just about renaming the station; it is about creating a new future as it goes into a 24 hour a day, seven day a week operation. I would like to congratulate the committee of management, its chairperson Alan Olsen, station manager John Dent and the many broadcasters and volunteers on the successful upgrade of a community asset. (Time expired) Agriculture: Sugar Industry Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (9.49 a.m.)-I would like to extend a very warm welcome to my fellow Queenslanders who have been in Canberra holding talks with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss, to resolve the difficulties facing the Queensland sugar industry. To Queensland Canegrowers Organisation General Manager, Ian Ballantyne, and his Chairman, Jim Pederson; Chairman of the Australian Sugar Milling Council, Geoff Mitchell and General Manager, Max Craigie; and other representatives of the industry from Queensland, I say: thank you for your efforts. From the perspective of CanberraI know that the North Queensland sugar industry may seem a long way from my electorate of Petrie in Brisbane, but the sugar industry touches the lives of most Queenslanders, wherever they live. Queenslanders understand most that sugar is not just something you buy; it is produced by the blood, sweat and tears of an industry to which many of us have direct family links. We understand how tough it is now, and how tough it was a century back, because many of us have had grandparents or parents who MAIN COMMITTEE worked in sugar and who knew first-hand its economic uncertainties and hardships and looked for a more secure life down in Brisbane. When they arrived in Australia in 1950, my father and grandfather first started working on the North Queensland sugar cane farms. My uncle by marriage, Roy Diecke, was an institution as the Chairman of Bundaberg Sugar. Many families in Petrie’s strong Italian suburbs of Stafford, Chermside, Aspley and Bald Hills share the same family links to sugar, and they celebrate this every year in North Queensland at the Italian festivals at Innisfail and Silkwoodwhere the Festival of the Three Saints has been attended by representatives of the Italian government, such is its fame. Maybe, when the Queensland Premier is next looking for somewhere to demonstrate his new-found concern for the sugar industry, he might consider funding the Festival of the Three Saints, which is on 2 May this year. It has never received any funding from the government, despite its many requests and the Queensland government’s commitment to multicultural funding. By contrast, the federal government has shown a serious commitment to the funding of productive solutions to the problems of the sugar industry, and talks were held last night. Those talks were more productive than the recent talks with Premier Beattie, when he spoke with sugar representatives. All he did was invite 11 sugar representatives along. It became a de facto union meeting because it was dominated by dozens of uninvited trade union representatives, headed by Bill Ludwig and ETU delegates, who just happened to be in the building at the same time. Little wonder that the genuine sugar delegates felt that that meeting told us nothing new. No wonder the Queensland sugar industry is suspicious of Mr Beattie. The last time the federal government put up $80 million, $10 million was put up by the state government and only $60,000 was ever distributed. The federal government have already put $120 million on the table, and we are endeavouring to work with representatives of the industry to find a solution to some of these structural adjustment problems. Mr Beattie needs to show more faith, so he will not be received in the way he was when he tried to shout down the sugar industry in his recent North Queensland election campaign visit. Veterans: Entitlements bills, I raised the issue of veterans’ entitlements and the failure of the Howard government and the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Danna Vale, to deliver on the Clarke report. This government, like many governments of all persuasions, is ready to commit our troops to overseas engagements. It is happy to dedicate memorials overseas and to enjoy the many photo opportunities with veterans upon their return. That is the easy bit. But many in this place can remember the Voyager disaster which took place about 40 years ago, and I find it absolutely amazing-and quite disgusting-that the Commonwealth is still failing to recognise the post traumatic stress disorder suffered by the veterans who were part of the Melbourne and the Voyager disaster. As I say, it took place over 40 years ago. These veterans, many of them now in their seventies, are being put through the indignity of having to justify, at great cost, the stress that they went through, the vivid memories of losing colleagues and the trauma of what happened on that night. I was approached by one of the veterans. I will not give you his name, because he is part of the legal process and I would hate to jeopardise his case against the Commonwealth.

199,Mr Quick (Franklin) (9.52 A.m.),"Yesterday, during my speech on the appropriationyer has advised him that the Commonwealth, which has a fixation with chasing people-with a perception that they are rorting the system-is continuing to use private investigators who are visiting all your clubs, former employers, neighbours, former wives, if you have any, and parents to obtain as much information as it can on your history during the past 40 years. I find that absolutely obscene. As I said, we are happy to send them overseas, to be at the wharf and to wave them goodbye with the bands playing Waltzing Matilda. When they come back, we are happy to have happy snaps, give them medals and dedicate memorials. But when veterans go through something as dramatic as the Voyager and Melbourne disaster and then have to justify what they have done over the past 40 years because the government is so mealy-mouthed and meanspirited I find it absolutely appalling. Very little is being said in this place about these veterans. I have got a couple of them in my electorate and I can assure you that they are going through real stress-not only them, but their families and extended families as well. I encourage the government to sort this mess out once and for all in the coming budget. New South Wales: Redfern Protests in Redfern in terrible circumstances. The riots that resulted from that in Redfern in Sydney were quite obviously some of the worse rioting and race disturbances we have ever seen in Australia. I suppose that if they did anything they probably, in that area at least, set back a long way the causes of reconciliation and of bringing the Aboriginal people out into better situations. You hear responsible leaders like Noel Pearson, Aden Ridgeway and Warren Mundinefrom my own town of Dubbo-say ‘We have really got to take a hard look at ourselves as well as the system’ and say that Aboriginal people themselves have a responsibility to stay calm as well as seek retribution for any injustices they feel may have happened in the past. Personally, as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I have seen as I have gone around Australia in recent times incredible movement forward in the Aboriginal people themselves, saying: ‘Welfare is not the answer for us; getting up and doing things ourselves is. Give us the chance to work.’ It is the most heartening thing I have seen in my couple of years in parliament. But when I hear a lunatic like Lyall Munro, apparently from Redfern, calling for places like Dubbo and Walgett to rise up and riot and cause the same sort of trouble I wonder what he thinks he is doing. For example, there are probably places so much worse than Dubbo, which has done incredible things in trying to get more employment. We have recently put $1 million into new employment schemes. We actually do have a pretty good understanding there and are getting a long way forward. For him to actually call for a place like that to riot and to try and blame the police for every single thing that goes wrong means that Lyall Munro needs to have a very hard look at himself, listen to people like Noel Pearson, Aden Ridgeway and Warren Mundine and realise that this is about doing things for yourself as much as it is about pointing the finger at others. When you look at what happens in a place like Dubbo, you see that we have the Gordon Centre, which does incredible things with young people, and we have leaders there who are actually saying to their own people as well as the broader community, ‘Let us work with you to improve it.’ A lunatic getting up and saying, ‘Let places like Walgett and Dubbo go riotMAIN COMMITTEE",120,Statements By Members

(Time expired) der 275A the time for members’ statements has concluded. Corporation And Financial Services Committee Reports Debate resumed from 16 February, on motion by Mr Hunt: That the House take note of the reports. of the issues raised by the particular report of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services entitled Report on the ATM fee structure, which I had hoped to speak about in the House on Monday. Unfortunately, because of business elsewhere I was unable to be in attendance at that time. The pair of reports by the committee raise some very interesting issues about the question of the provision of banking services in rural and regional Australia. Most of the results of both reports are in fact bipartisan. I would particularly like to focus on the issue of ATM fees and some of the implications for the future that were shown in the reports in respect of that particular issue. With respect to ATM fees, as part of a program of reform initiated by the Reserve Bank, a range of initiatives are being considered around things like credit card fees, EFTPOS and ATMs. An industry working group on ATM fees-the ATM industry steering group-has been considering proposals for reform in that area. In particular, they have looked at the question of the abolition of interchange fees and the establishment of greater transparency with respect to the fees you are paying when you use an ATM. The committee are very supportive of that opportunity to give consumers clear and concise information about what in fact they will have to pay when they use an ATM. As part of that proposal, the issue of general deregulation in this area has come up. I have some concerns about that in terms of the logical implications and considering some of the experience overseas with respect to ATM fees in this circumstance. The particular issue here is the question of foreign ATM fees. Foreign ATM fees occur in a situation where, say, I happen to be a Commonwealth Bank customer and I use an ATM at the ANZ Bank, a credit union or the National Australia Bank-an ATM from another institution. I will be charged a foreign ATM fee. Essentially, the institution whose ATM I am using is in fact charging me a fee for allowing me to use their infrastructure that they provide on behalf of their customers. The issue is that ATM fees, particularly in those circumstances with foreign ATM fees, can be exorbitant and incredibly excessive. The experience overseas has been that, where deregulation has occurred, foreign ATM fees have been as high as $5-plus for someone to use another institution’s ATM. That can vary greatly and that is not necessarily the norm, but it is certainly something that has occurred overseas. When we look at the situation in Australia, even at the moment in terms of the current system, foreign ATM fees have increased some 250 per cent since 1995. The current foreign ATM fee usage can average about $1.35, but it can be as high as $2. MAIN COMMITTEE",121,Statements By Members
201,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley),Order! In accordance with standing or,122,Committees
202,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (9.59 A.m.),"This debate today is an opportunity to deal with someWhen you look to the overseas experience you see that there have been some very disturbing examples of what might occur with foreign ATM fees. In the United States, fees have gone through the roof. In particular jurisdictions in the United States, with respect to this surcharge on ATM fees, there have been moves to have them banned. I want to quote from an article in Time magazine from November 1999: Consider the turmoil at ATMs in San Francisco and Santa Monica, Calif., which became the first US. cities to ban bank ATM surcharges. Megabanks Wells Fargo and Bank of America fired back by closing their ATMs to nondepositors in Santa Monica and threatening to do the same in San Francisco when its law takes effect in December-all of which made cardholders even angrier. A federal judge sided with the banks by blocking the anti-fee laws until a fair trial can determine their constitutionality. Says Santa Monica council member Michael Feinstein: ‘The electorate’s response to the ordinance has been overwhelmingly positive. So far, more than a dozen communities, from Los Angeles to Miami, have begun to target ATM surcharges. The most threatening to banks is New York City, where city council speaker Peter Vallone plans to unveil a proposal next month that would restrict ATM fees in the nation’s financial capital. In Congress, Representative Bernard Sanders, a Vermont independent, has introduced federal antisurcharge legislation. Even the Defense Department has joined the offensive: it wants to ban fees from ATMs on military bases. As we can see, the overseas experience with respect to this issue is quite disturbing and the potential for things to go wrong in the Australian situation should not be underestimated. The report that we are looking at today from the joint committee considered this issue and, to be fair to the majority of the members on the committee, they effectively said that there should not be a great differential. I would like to quote from the one of the recommendations in the report. I will quote the entire recommendation so that people can be clear about the context: The Committee recommends that the ATM Industry Steering Group include in its considerations on the reform of ATM interchange fee arrangements the special circumstances of fees and charges associated with the use of foreign ATMs in rural, regional and remote Australia. The focus of the group would be on building into any proposed reform of the ATM fee structure, safeguards that would ensure that people living in country towns and remote communities do not incur significantly higher fees or charges for using a foreign ATM and that an unreasonable or unwarranted differential in fees and charges between those in rural and remote areas and those in metropolitan areas does not develop. I would like to go back over that wording. I will quote selectively from that recommendation to make the point. Again, it says: ... ensure that ... towns and remote communities do not incur significantly higher fees or chargesand... an unreasonable or unwarranted differential in fees and charges ... does not develop. The fact is that the majority report of the committee, supported by the coalition members and the Democrats, basically says it is okay to have a differential in the rate between country and metropolitan areas-that is, between one part of a town and another; between one bank and another bank; between an ATM in a hotel and an ATM in a service station; and between an ATM in a shopping centre and an ATM in a bank. It is basically giving a green light for that differential to occur. We then put ourselves into a situation of having an argument about what ‘unreasonable or unwarranted differential’ actually means. I know from talking to people in rural and regional Australia that they already believe that they are often dealing with unreaMAIN COMMITTEE sonable and unwarranted differentials with respect to service delivery and costs in their communities. Even now they believe that that is the case. In fact, in many cases it is the case. This report basically gives the green light for that to actually occur. It says to the banks, to the providers of services in this area, to the people outside the banks who may own the ATM networks: ‘It is okay; you can do it. Then we can have an argument later on about what is unreasonable and unwarranted.’ As members would know, one of the problems with dealing with the banking sector over the last few years in particular-although I think it has been a general issue for a long time now-is that the question of unreasonable and unwarranted action is very much a matter of judgment. The genesis for this report in relation to services in these areas was a general concern that the committee had about service delivery in rural and regional Australia. To come down with a majority report which gives the green light for those differentials to occur I find mind-boggling. I know that the National Party in the New South Wales parliament have come out and opposed this and have commented on the fact that it is an unfair and unreasonable surcharge to put upon the people of country New South Wales. I am sure that, as the public becomes more aware of this detail, more concerns will be raised. I suspect that we may well find in times to come that there may even be another revolt in the party room on this particular issue, as members in rural and regional Australia actually work out what it means, what the Liberal members of the committee agreed to and what that could mean in relation to their constituencies. The committee had a roundtable hearing with the various parties on the steering group, plus consumer groups et cetera to talk about these issues. The banks have said that they do not believe that they will be charging differentials. Certainly, the Australian Bankers Association have said that they do not think it is an issue. At least two of the major banks have said that that is the case. Others have been curiously silent. But it is not just about the banks. That is the thing about this. It is all right for the banks to say, ‘We won’t do this’-I hope they do say that and I hope they do not do it-but the fact is that when you are talking about this type of technology the experience even now in Australia, and certainly overseas, is that the banks often do not own the ATMs. It is happening here and it has certainly happened a lot overseas. We have had a situation where companies go in to provide ATM technology and actually set up the networks and run them themselves. They are the ones who make the profit and they rely on those machines. It no longer becomes part of an overall operation; it becomes the sole focus, the core business of their operation. In those circumstances, the experience overseas has been that they are exactly the people who do impose a surcharge. They may not even be the people we are talking to at the moment. They may not even be the people who have been saying that they will not be doing it. They rely on those surcharge fees to become the very basis of their business. When we look at what has happened overseas, we see that they are the ones that have been doing it. The comments made by banks and others that they will not do that and the Reserve Bank’s view, which is essentially to let the market rule in these circumstances, do not take into account the sorts of issues that we will be dealing with in rural and regional Australia. Part of the argument is that, if you allow surcharging, there may be an expansion of ATM provision into areas where those services are not currently being provided. That may well be the case but, again, where this has occurred overseas there is differing evidence as to what would be MAIN COMMITTEE the result. We could be looking at increased costs in rural and regional Australia; we could even be looking at increased costs in metropolitan areas. With gambling, for example, if there is an ATM in a pokie venue, you may well put the fees up because you know that you are dealing with a captive audience. In that circumstance, people will find themselves paying a lot more. I draw members’ attention to recommendation 4 of the ATM fee structure report, which reads: The Committee recommends that should a direct charging regime be introduced both the RBA and the ACCC closely monitor shifts in fees and charges for foreign ATM services and report publicly on developments in fees charged. We totally agree with that recommendation. It is something that we have been calling for in a general sense, around the whole question of bank fees and charges, for a number of years. In the last few years, the banks in Australia have regularly been ramping up fees-particularly over the past seven or eight years but as far back as nine or 10 years ago. When the Labor opposition raises this issue, the Treasurer often says, ‘Why didn’t you institute ACCC monitoring?’ The reason is that bank fees and charges were not the issue that they are now. Back in those days there was a degree of cross-subsidisation and this was not a key area for banks to increase their profit margins. But, over the last eight years or so, the banks have been rampantly increasing their fees in order to maintain and grow their already record profits. It is good to see a committee with a bipartisan recommendation, which is that we should see proper monitoring by the ACCC in this area and public reporting on the results. The experience in this area is that, when the banks are watched and evaluated and given a public caning-or at least public exposure in a general sense-if they do the wrong thing, it tends to ameliorate their actions. In fact, the Treasurer himself has provided an example of this on one occasion. Members may recall-I think it was last year-that the National Australia Bank recommended some changes to the value of their frequent flyer points as part of their frequent flyer scheme. When they suggested that they would retrospectively alter the value of those points, the Treasurer quite rightly announced that he would refer this matter to the ACCC for investigation. Within 24 hours the National Australia Bank backed off because they realised that their actions would not survive proper public scrutiny and that, once the ACCC was formally involved, that scrutiny would occur. That is why we need scrutiny in these areas, and I am certainly supportive of the recommendation from the committee. It shows that at least some members of the coalition have an understanding of this issue. It is a pity that they could not convince the Treasurer to move down the same track in a more general sense to ensure that the public get the information they need to be able to make proper, informed decisions about banking and to ensure that the banks are actually exposed to proper public scrutiny. But, with regard to the other issue, the majority of the committee got it all wrong. There are some real dangers here for rural and regional Australia if deregulation occurs and institutions can charge fees at a rampant level. That is what we will probably see. If we are not careful there will be real problems for rural and regional Australia. (Time expired) rations and Financial Services report on the ATM fee structure proposes some welcome changes, particularly recommendation 3 relating to real-time disclosure of ATM fees and charges, which will ensure that customers can cancel transactions before incurring fees. RecMAIN COMMITTEE",122,Committees
203,Mr Organ (Cunningham) (10.14 A.m.),"The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corpoommendation 1, aimed at ensuring that people in rural and remote communities do not face higher ATM fees than those in metropolitan areas, is something no-one would argue against. Similarly, recommendation 2, which proposes that the cost of obtaining an account balance is kept to a minimum, is something which will give real benefits to ATM users. These three recommendations will go a long way to alleviating some of the problems which stem from the massive reduction in the availability of face-to-face banking that we have experienced in recent years as banks close branches in the name of so-called efficiency and the push for increased profitability. Recommendation 4, however, troubles me, as it clearly troubled opposition members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. Two of the areas the committee was to place particular focus on were: firstly, options for expansion of banking facilities through non-traditional channels, including new technologies; and, secondly, international experiences and policies designed to enhance and improve the quality of rural banking services. Recommendation 4 deals with a so-called direct-charging regime, where an ATM owner-operator would levy a direct charge on all card holders who use its ATM service, rather than the current model where the card issuer sets the fees. The committee noted the ATM industry steering group’s view that direct charging would establish an environment for price competition between ATM service providers where the freedom to set fees would be: … expected to stimulate the provision of ATM services and make them flexible and responsive to changes in costs and cardholder demand. I am concerned that recent developments in the ATM market may mean that this is nothing more than a pipedream. By way of background, I draw honourable members’ attention to the fact that the joint committee’s report notes that there were 21,603 ATMs around Australia in June 2003, up from 16,398 in June 2002. That is an increase of 32 per cent in just one year. On the other hand, it took three years for the number of ATMs to grow from 10,089 in June 2000 to 16,398. Clearly something is happening out there, and whatever it is you can rest assured that it has little to do with better service and everything to do with increased profitability. As I said just now, I am concerned about recent developments in the ATM market. That concern is based on the fact that just over a quarter of the ATMs existing in June 2003 belonged to one provider, and that provider is being taken over by a major player from the United States. First Data Corporation, the parent company of money transfer giant Western Union, is proposing to acquire Australian ATM provider Cashcard, through its local subsidiary First Data Resources Asia Pacific Ltd. Cashcard has more ATMs than the Commonwealth Bank-around 5,670 in fact. That is about 49 per cent of the independent ATM market and reportedly accounts for about 10 per cent of the debit and credit processing market. Cashcard has more than 50 member institutions, by far the majority of them from the building society and credit union sector. These institutions of course operate as mutuals, where profits benefit members through reduced fee structures and lending interest rates, rather than being returned to shareholders as dividends. One of those member institutions is the IMB, the Illawarra Mutual Building Society, whose headquarters are in Wollongong, in my electorate of Cunningham. The IMB has 38 ATMs across three states and the ACT. So Cashcard, which is 15 per cent owned by the Australian building society network, 15 per cent by Suncorp, eight MAIN COMMITTEE per cent by St George Bank, five per cent by Adelaide Bank and 29 per cent by Gresham Private Equity, among others, will fall into the hands of just one company. That does not seem to me to do much for competition in the Australian ATM market. And it does less when you realise that First Data Resources Asia Pacific Ltd describes itself as Australia’s largest independent electronic payment systems network. Indeed, our local subsidiary of this US financial giant, for that is what First Data Corporation is, has as its objective: … to process every electronic transaction in Asia Pacific from the point of occurrence to the point of settlement. Does this mean that they want to monopolise the market? It sounds like it to me. First Data Corporation returned a net income of $US1.408 billion in 2003-up 13.8 per cent on the previous year. It employs 29,000 people. It is ranked at No. 242 on the Fortune 500 and No. 130 on the FT Global 500. It is, indeed, a US financial giant with a lot of muscle to flex. It has so much muscle, in fact, that the US Department of Justice, seven state attorneys-general-from Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio and Texas-along with the District of Columbia took legal action to prevent it from acquiring another debit processing network company, Concord EFS Inc. The US Department of Justice contended that the $7 billion merger would substantially reduce competition in transactions which require the entry of a personal identification number-that is, the PIN we all use every time we access funds through an ATM. The head of the US Department of Justice’s antitrust division said that the proposed merger of First Data and Concord: … will lead to higher prices to merchants, forcing them to pass on those price increases to many consumers … in the form of higher prices for general merchandise. First Data and Concord settled the matter by agreeing to divest First Data’s interest in another PIN based debit network. So the fairly obvious question arises: is First Data picking up Australia’s Cashcard, a PIN based debit network, to fill that gap? Clearly the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, does not think so. It announced just last week that it would not oppose the acquisition of Cashcard by First Data. ACCC Chairman, Graeme Samuel, said: The ACCC has conducted extensive market inquiries consulting with a range of interested parties and noted some concern regarding the proposed acquisition. However, the presence of other strong competitors in the markets is likely to operate as an effective competitive constraint on the merged entity, thereby constraining attempts to raise prices to customers. In fact, some market participants believe the proposed acquisition is likely to intensify competition in the market. On this basis, the ACCC concluded that the proposed alliance is unlikely to result in a substantial lessening of competition. I wish I could be as confident. Unfortunately, Chairman Samuel’s limp assurance that the takeover is ‘unlikely to result in a substantial lessening of competition’ leaves the door open to the possibility that it will result in a substantial lessening of competition within Australia. The prospect of an overseas-controlled financial giant owning the ATMs and Australia’s largest independent electronic payment systems network is not one which I am at all comfortable with. MAIN COMMITTEE It is something which needs to be looked at very carefully. While I commend the report, I would wish to see the joint committee take up the question of just who is going to own Australia’s ATM network. After all, it is going to be pretty difficult to keep fees down if one multinational financial giant has the lion’s share of the system. We can only hope that it does not lead to disadvantage for those in rural, regional and remote Australia in particular. Mind you, in my own metropolitan electorate of Cunningham we will also be affected if monopolisation occurs. This issue needs continued scrutiny. cussion about these two very important documents that have been tabled today: the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services report on the ATM fee structure and that committee’s report entitled Money matters in the bush, a report on its inquiry into the level of banking and financial services in rural, regional and remote Australia. Firstly, I want to go to the ATM report. When reading through this document, I thought I should remind the House of the importance of this sort of discussion to the place where I live and to my constituents in Central and Northern Australia. I think it is also important when reading this document to understand, as background, the reality for people who live in these parts of Australia. My office adjoins an ATM-the back part of one wall is an ATM-and there are two other ATMs within 50 metres of the office. A large number of people visit my office daily. They are generally Aboriginal Australians from the bush coming into town to do their business. Many of them come into the office to seek basic assistance in obtaining account balances and making general inquiries about banking issues. In this regard, a lot of good work has been done over recent times by ATSIC, the ACCC and Reconciliation Australia, with initiatives such as the national workshop held in Alice Springs in April 2002 that considered Indigenous consumer issues in regional and remote Australia. In this forum, I would like to thank the banks who forwarded to my office copies of their submissions to this committee’s inquiry. It needs to be made clear, and I have said it before in this chamber, that many Indigenous Australians are not comfortable using ATMs and simply agreeing to hand over their cards and PIN numbers to various traders who then directly access the bank accounts of their clients for payments against book-up and other services. This is a huge issue, and it is traversed in this report and, indeed, the other report on banking services. I want to make mention of some work which has been done in this area by two very professional and proficient people, Siobhan McDonell and Neil Westbury. I mentioned this in a contribution I made to the debate on the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 2002. Both of these people were then working for the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research at the Australian National University. They wrote a paper called Giving credit where it’s due: the delivery of banking services to Indigenous Australians in rural and remote areas. The paper argued that deregulation has had a profound impact on Indigenous people-and I think that is confirmed by the evidence which was gained during these two inquiries-and that, without the ability to save, many Indigenous Australians and certainly others are denied a range of economic opportunities and, in particular, the opportunity to break out of the poverty trap. These two writers then wrote about the failure of financial providers to take account of the different conceptions that Indigenous people have of financial facilities, the problems caused by the inadequate provision of banking and financial services in the region, the fact that many MAIN COMMITTEE",125,Committees
204,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (10.23 A.m.),"I am pleased to be able to participate in the disIndigenous people do not understand either the way bank fees and charges operate or how to minimise these fees and charges, and the low technical proficiency of many Indigenous people. The recommendations of both these reports address in some way or another these issues. We need to comprehend that there are 1,200 or so discrete Indigenous communities across Australia, and many of them are very small. Many of them do not have access-and it is picked up in these reports-to the most basic financial services. We also know that not only do they not have access to these basic services but also many of them really have no comprehension of the transactions they are undertaking when they get hold of a card. I note that one of the recommendations of the committee is that, when considering reforms to the ATM fee structure, the ISG give full consideration to ensuring that the price of obtaining an account balance is kept to a minimum and that, at the very least, it is in line with the costs associated with delivering the service. We need to comprehend what this means, because for many people the charges that are applied to these transactions become excessive. I have here-and I will seek leave to table them shortly-the account details, with no identifiers on them, of people who have been using banking facilities, ATMs, where they have simply been seeking to find out how much money is in their account while waiting for transfer payments to be paid into it. We have an example here of one person whose account had $10 in it and by the end of the day they had had $5 worth of charges. I seek leave to table these documents, which become self-explanatory once you read them. Leave granted. of providing the machines or the cards but also an issue of providing the wherewithal to actually use them-that is, through very basic financial literacy arrangements. It is very important when we read these reports that we appreciate that it is very difficult for many people to understand the complicated financial statements they receive. We also need to comprehend that there are many Australians for whom English is a second or third language and that for many Australians literacy is a major problem-they cannot read and they have very great difficulty understanding the sorts of statements that banks provide. Not enough is being done by the financial sector to provide people with information. I notice one of the report recommendations-I cannot go to it immediately-talks about people being sent information. Frankly, just sending people information in the mail is not good enough. No matter how reader-friendly it might be, if you cannot read it it is irrelevant. We need to have a major exercise in consumer training about financial services across the country, particularly in remote areas. A range of other issues are addressed in these reports. I commend the reports-they contain a great deal of very helpful information. I want to particularly remark on chapters 14 and 15 of the report entitled Money matters in the bush. They provide very important detailed information on not only the difficulty many Indigenous Australians confront but also the very good work that is being done by organisations such as Tangentyere Council in Alice Springs and the Traditional Credit Union in the Northern Territory. MAIN COMMITTEE",128,Committees
205,Mr Snowdon,"It is extremely important that we understand that it is not just an issueI particularly want to go to the issue of corporate social responsibility. It is not a complex idea; it is about governments and businesses working together, recognising joint obligations to treat low-income people and communities not just as customers but also as citizens. This is not about forcing banks to do things that threaten their commercial viability; it is about recognising that the finance sector’s collective responsibility runs deeper than the responsibility to shareholders. It is, as I think I alluded to earlier, about people, not just profits; it is about community interests, not just corporate interests. We need to underline that and put it in block type. In my view one of the most difficult tasks we have is to get the financial sector to appreciate that they do have a social obligation which they must carry out. To quote my leader with respect to Civilising Global Capital: ‘It is a smart way to combine the imperatives of society with the imperatives of the market.’ In the United States the Community Reinvestment Act has been in operation for 25 years. This act encourages banks to help meet the lending needs of the communities in which they operate, including lowand moderate-income communities. The records of banks and other financial institutions are formally evaluated on this score. I think that would be an important introduction, if we were to do that in Australia-it would provide a very transparent method of ensuring that banks actually do live up to their responsibilities. As a result of this, we know that everyone-governments and, most particularly, citizenscan see which institutions are pulling their weight and which are not. They can then make appropriate judgments. As in Australia, the financial services landscape in the United States has changed. Today the traditional role of the CRA in generating loans to local customers, while still important, is not sufficient, particularly as the branch network-as is the case here in Australia-plays a reduced role in the system as a whole. There is a growing recognition that there are other unmet challenges, as identified in these reports, such as the need to extend the reach of banking services to low-income people and to expand access to capital for the economic development of low-income communities. This is a very important issue across remote and Northern Australia. This latter factor is often referred to as community development finance, and different institutions compete as to who can do it best. Again, this is a case of the market being used to deliver new solutions to entrenched social problems. But it takes government to provide the impetus. Financial services are critical to the functioning of individuals and their communities. This was a point brought home by the ANZ Bank’s recent survey on financial literacy-the first such survey undertaken here in Australia. For Indigenous communities, who are too often off the radar in this debate, the problems are even more difficult. I have emphasised that time and time again in this place and I do so again this morning. With regard to issues of financial literacy and access to basic financial services, Indigenous communities are simply not on the radar. We need a fresh institutional framework for how we expand financial services and access to capital for low-income people and communities. Corporate social responsibility must be a key element of that work. I want to refer the House to two documents. The first, from the United States, is a report of a native American lending study done by the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. This report outlines in great detail how people can access community financial institutions, and I think it provides a bit of a signpost as to what we should be doing in this country. The second document is entitled ‘Effective Strategies for Community Development Finance’. MAIN COMMITTEE This document also makes it very clear that there are ways in which government, working in conjunction with the banks, sometimes using its regulatory powers, can ensure that people have access to forms of lending and finance. The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund is run by the United States Department of Treasury. The fund is a wholly owned government corporation that was established in 1994. The CDFI Fund assists the financial institutions that work in market niches that have been underserved by traditional financial institutions. It provides a wide range of products and services, such as affordable home mortgages, home ownership counselling and capital and technical assistance for start-up and minority owned small businesses. It also supports the building of community facilities. I will not go through the detail of these programs. We need to be examining very closely what has happened elsewhere in the world and use it as an example and, if we can, a template for what we could do here. We need to do a great deal more about forging a relationship between financial services and access to resources, to loan money and to equity for people who live in poorer socioeconomic circumstances, most particularly those poorest of Australians-the Indigenous Australians who live in the remote parts of Australia, especially those in my own electorate. Debate (on motion by Mr Baird) adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Legal Aid: Funding Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (10.39 a.m.)-I want to use this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of community legal centres in this country, particularly the work of the Central Queensland Community Legal Centre. It does a fantastic job in fairly difficult circumstances in providing free legal advice and community legal education to people living in the Central Queensland region. Community legal centres play a unique and essential role in the mix of legal service delivery in this country. Community legal centres are often the first point of contact for people who have little or no experience with the legal system. They provide that service in a way that is very accessible, that is not in any way intimidating and that is very responsive to the needs of a diverse range of clients. They take a very holistic approach to the delivery of their legal services, being able to offer referral and advice across a wide range of issues to people accessing the centres. They are community managed, so they are very much in touch with the needs of their local communities. The community legal centre sector is facing a very difficult time at the moment. The demands on it are growing all the time and the funding that it has been receiving has not been keeping pace with the costs of providing services. Commonwealth funding for community legal centres has increased by only 2.45 per cent per annum in the years up to 2002, and during that same period of time average weekly earnings rose by 4.5 per cent. That is causing real problems for the community legal centres in Australia because their staffing costs actually represent a very large proportion of the costs of running the centres and of providing the vital services to the people in their communities. MAIN COMMITTEE",129,Committees
206,Mr Baird (Cook) (10.39 A.m.),"I move:This is all happening at the same time as the cuts by the Commonwealth to the legal aid budget. Since the election of the Howard government in 1996, these cuts are really starting to bite and very harshly affect communities and people seeking legal advice. In 1994-95 the amount of legal aid funding provided by the Commonwealth was $117.4 million. In 1996-97 that jumped to $128 million, but then in 1997 the cuts really started to take effect. Funding was reduced to $108 million, and it was only in the last year that it rose to $121 million. Studies by the Law Council of Australia estimate that it would take an extra $60 million per annum to get funding for legal services back to the levels of 1991. This is impacting very harshly on people in our country. It is now starting to have a deeper effect in that the costs of justice in this country are rising. The Law Council of Australia released a report in the last week that said, ‘Increased legal aid funding would be cheaper for state and federal governments than the spiralling court costs caused by those who did not understand the system but could not afford a lawyer.’ All of this is impacting on the community legal centre in Rockhampton. The demands on it are growing all the time. People are not able to get legal aid funding. The eligibility rules for legal aid funding are now so tight that you really are talking about only the most desperate and poor in our society being able to access legal aid, which is leaving a large proportion of the working poor-people on low incomes-still in need of access to legal representation. They cannot afford it out of their own pocket, they cannot afford private solicitors, and community legal centres are having to pick up the pieces. At the moment, the community legal centre in Rockhampton has a staff of two full-time solicitors, one full-time administrator and one office trainee. It has dealt with almost 1,000 clients in the seven-month period since July 2003, mainly in the areas of family law, civil law and criminal law. It is seeing an overflow of people who cannot access legal aid funding, who do not have the money to see a private solicitor, who are in real distress in trying to deal with legal situations that they have very little understanding of and who have no hope of representing themselves. The legal centre is seeking to expand its services to more outlying areas-and I commend it for that. I ask the federal government to start taking responsibility for access to justice in this country. Education: Higher Education Contribution Scheme Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (10.44 a.m.)-In a classic display of red herring politics, yesterday I had Bob Carr in my electorate. He did not visit our TAFEs, hospitals or schools. He actually went past all of those to the Werrington campus of US, where he urged students to sign a petition to the Australian government to reduce HECS repayments for the tertiary education they receive. Keep in mind that these HECS repayments are made after the person has completed their study, once they are in a job, and it is 4.5 per cent of their income once that is over 35 grand. I found that rather extraordinary when right next door to the Werrington campus that Bob Carr did visit is the TAFE campus. At this TAFE, fees have increased by 300 per cent in some cases. New South Wales TAFE students are paying up to $1,700 a year to study in New South Wales TAFEs. These are up-front fees-you pay now or you do not study. Quite clearly, TAFE students are not studying. We have seen a dramatic reduction in enrolments in our TAFEs, to the stage where, in fact, they are looking at laying off teachers. Why would Bob Carr be interested in education degrees if he is not even providing the opportunities for teachers to be employed in our TAFEs? MAIN COMMITTEE An education degree at the US costs around $3,768 a year. Under HECS you pay it later, when you are earning, as opposed to the TAFE students-and believe me, I have more TAFE students in my electorate than I have uni students-who are paying up to $1,700 upfront. If you add up that $3,768 a year for an education degree over three years, that is $11,304. Along with his petition Bob Carr came out with a flyer that said that students will graduate with mortgage sized debts. The average house price in the electorate of Lindsay is around $350,000. The stamp duty Bob Carr rips off from the people of the electorate of Lindsay for every housing transaction is $13,490 on a $400,000 house or $11,200 on a $350,000 one. If Bob Carr is so interested in the cost of university education, why doesn’t he promise university graduates a first home buyer package where you can get back from the state government your stamp duty on your first home? In the meantime, Nepean Hospital is critically short of nurses. Our hospitals desperately need all sorts of equipment, but Bob Carr is not providing it. As to the rail line, I noticed he came out to Penrith, but he did not catch the train after a week of strikesMiss JACKIE KELLY-No, he would not. He also did not stop at the Werrington train station. The Werrington train station for the university campus has been promised to the University of Western Sydney for a decade. I understand that the vice-chancellor has this Bob Carr promise on the train station written in blood. In fact, the vice-chancellor has designed the whole strategic plan for the university around this train station appearing. Believe me, she is as befuddled as the chancellor is on this one. Despite their cahoots on this latest stunt, that train station will never eventuate. It is as ethereal as the Parramatta-Epping train line. In terms of the carnage in our current timetabling on the Western Sydney line, there is no way that another train station is going to appear there. If Bob Carr wants to do something great for the university, why not start looking at how the students flow to and from that campus he visited? The other point I would like to make is in relation to payroll tax. Bob Carr gives some piffling amount to the university every year and he rips $10 million or thereabouts in payroll tax out of the university. If he is so concerned about US, why not give them some payroll tax relief and give the graduates some stamp duty relief? Here is another good one from our state Premier. He is boasting that land tax is now payable only on houses worth over $317,000. Come out to my area and have a look at what people are really paying for living standards and a university degree! (Time expired) McMillan Electorate: Pakenham Bypass to the people who live in the Pakenham district but also to the people who live in the Gippsland region, which makes up the lion’s share of the electorate of McMillan. This has been an important issue for some time. People in Pakenham are fed up to the back teeth with the attitude of the federal government to this project. The federal government have maintained that they never made a commitment to fund half of the Pakenham bypass, but they did make a commitment to fund half of the Pakenham bypass. Half of the cost of the Pakenham bypass is $121 million. That is a lot more than the $100 million that they have indicated they are going to commit to this project. MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Adjournment
207,Mr Baird,He wouldn’t get there!,133,Adjournment
208,Mr Zahra (Mcmillan) (10.49 A.m.),"The Pakenham bypass is very important not onlyThe reason I and everyone else in the Pakenham district and the Gippsland region think that the government committed to fund half of the cost of the Pakenham bypass is that they did. We all heard them, and we know what they said. Do not simply take it from me; listen to what the Cardinia Shire Council had to say in a letter to the Prime Minister on this very issue. I point out that the Cardinia Shire Council is not a Labor controlled council. To the best of my knowledge, there is not even a person on the council who is a Labor Party member. It is simply a group made up of ordinary members of the community who have stepped forward to serve their community in that capacity. The CEO of Cardinia Shire Council wrote to the Prime Minister about this project. He said: In the last election, council understood that the federal government had committed to the project as a Road of National Importance, and the funding would be on a dollar-for-dollar basis. There it is in black and white. If the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Liberal Party and The Nationals are calling me and the people of Pakenham liars then they are really calling the Cardinia Shire Council and its councillors liars. I can assure you that people have conducted themselves with integrity and with a great deal of sincerity in relation to this campaign and the attempts to try and make sure that this important road project goes ahead. I want to quote a little more of the letter sent last year by the CEO of Cardinia Shire Council to the Prime Minister. He went on to say: The overriding issue is that the community is impatient for the project to proceed. Your government has acknowledged that this bypass will remedy problems in one of the most dangerous stretches of road in Australia, being the Princes Highway east of Pakenham. Further delays are unacceptable to the community on the basis of more injury and lives being lost and the cost to the community will outweigh the figures debated by governments. The letter continues: I understand that one of the major contributors to the escalation in costs of the road is land cost. Council can confirm that the land values in the growth corridor of Cardinia have escalated well above the forecast of the most informed valuers. There must be flexibility in contributions to recognise these unforeseen increases that are beyond the control of the planners of the project. Towards the end of his letter to the Prime Minister, he said: Council urges you to put aside the bickering with the state government and commit on a dollar-fordollar basis for the present estimated cost of the Pakenham bypass. The CEO of Cardinia Shire Council and the councillors are right about this issue. We do not want to see more bickering from the state government and the federal government about this. We think it is fair enough that this important national road be funded on a fifty-fifty basis. The state government have put in their $121 million, which is half, and the federal government have put in $100 million, which is not half. So we are saying to the federal government, ‘Put in the remaining $21 million, and let’s get this road built.’ There is no point in us going back to the past and saying, ‘At one point the cost of the project was only $200 million, and now it is $242 million.’ There is no point in us talking about the price of cars in the 1950s or people getting a block of land for  LQ WKH V 7KH IDFW LV WKDW WKDW LV KRZ PXFK LW costs today. People want governments to fund this project so that it can get built and people can get the benefit of this road project today-not in 10 years, not in 20 years, not in 30 years. We need this road built now so that we can get the benefits in terms of public safety for the people of the Pakenham district and the Gippsland region. MAIN COMMITTEE Environment: Kurnell Peninsula decision of the Land and Environment Court in New South Wales to allow a major industrial project by the development company Australand to proceed on the Kurnell Peninsula. I have spoken many times before in this place about the need to protect and conserve this historic and ecologically significant area. The effect of this decision of the Land and Environment Court will allow Australand to construct an industrial park abutting the base of one of the few remaining sand dunes on the peninsula. As honourable members would know, the Kurnell Peninsula is a vitally important area in both environmental and historic terms. The area has over 50 per cent of the mangroves and in excess of 90 per cent of the remaining salt marshes in the Sydney basin. The area is home to various endangered species such as the green-andgold bell frog, the little tern, the eastern long-neck turtle and the dugong. Additionally, Kurnell is of great importance as the birthplace of modern Australia. Sandmining has been occurring on the Kurnell Peninsula since the 1930s when the shire council of the day sold the land. Since that time the Kurnell Peninsula has been mined to provide building sand for the construction industry. As I speak here today, there are three privately owned sandmining companies which are mining the heart out of the peninsula at an unsustainable rate. It is estimated that 25,000 tonnes of sand are removed from the Kurnell Peninsula each week. This amounts to a total of some 1.5 million tonnes per annum. The Kurnell Peninsula was exceptional in the Sydney basin due to its large, unique and delicate sand dune system. This dune system has now been all but destroyed by sandmining. Where sand dunes once towered to heights of more than 200 feet there are now a series of lakes and ponds. Some of these ponds are estimated to be up to 40 metres deep in parts. There is now only one major sand dune remaining. There is significant concern amongst elements of the environmental community that the continued removal of sand from the Kurnell Peninsula will weaken the ability of the peninsula to resist storms. The Kurnell Peninsula has a rocky outcrop to the east and is largely made up of sand acting as a bridge between the northern end of Cronulla and a rocky outcrop near Cape Solander. By continuing to mine sand from the peninsula at such a rate, there is a fear that a large storm could breach the foreshore facing Bate Bay and connect it with the ponds and lakes, which litter the neck of the peninsula and we could ultimately see a break through into Botany Bay. As honourable members would also be aware, Kurnell has added significance as it is the birthplace of modern Australia. It was at Point Sutherland at Kurnell that Captain James Cook landed on 29 April 1770. It was also on the Kurnell Peninsula that the penal colony of New South Wales was proclaimed on 26 January 1788. We have seen a long campaign about the need to conserve this area on the basis of its historic significance. It would be a shame for the New South Wales government to shirk its duty to protect what was the birthplace of the colony of New South Wales and the first Western settlement on our great continent-an act which led to the formation of this wonderful nation of ours. This area should be a place that is protected for all Australians to enjoy. The destruction of the Kurnell Peninsula through overexploitation is a matter of grave concern to my constituents. Sutherland Shire Council has tried to halt sandmining for years through the courts but has been unsuccessful due to inadequate planning controls. A petition of residents was recently undertaken in Cronulla, Caringbah and Kurnell which resulted in MAIN COMMITTEE",133,Adjournment
209,Mr Baird (Cook) (10.55 A.m.),"I wish to draw the attention of the House to the recentsome 4,000 signatures calling on the state government to halt the destruction of this precious area. The importance of this area cannot be underestimated. It is time that the New South Wales state government acted to protect the Kurnell Peninsula once and for all. Premier Bob Carr announced with great fanfare in February of last year that the site would be listed on the state heritage register; yet due to inadequate planning controls, the court has been unable to stop this development from proceeding. Legislation needs to be enacted to protect this area for future generations. The same developer has a proposal for the construction of 500 homes on the remainder of the site. This proposal has been with the Minister for Planning since 2000. The New South Wales government needs to state on the record its true position on the Kurnell Peninsula. The developer Australand made a contribution of some $50,000 to the Labor Party before the last state election. The actions of this so-called green Premier to stop this threat to Kurnell will be interesting to watch in light of this very large donation. Finance: Lending reports-in particular, about a recent article in Choice magazine looking at issues with respect to this-and, on from that, about the overall question of the Office of the Federal Privacy Commissioner and the circumstances of that organisation’s funding and resourcing. In particular, on the issue of credit reporting, members will be aware that credit reports basically involve the collection, disclosure and maintenance of information relating to consumers’ creditworthiness. There are some three companies who deal in the collection and collation of this data. Essentially, it is often used by businesses and financial institutions to determine whether in fact somebody is a good credit risk. It can lead to the determination of whether one gets a housing loan or some other loan, so it is a pretty important area. It is an area where there are clearly some very serious problems. To give you an example, I will read briefly from that Choice article about what can happen with respect to credit reporting, in terms of the circumstances of an individual: Over a four-year period MrR was unable to get credit: one home loan and eight personal loan applications were rejected by various lenders. Finally one lender named his bad credit report as the reason. MrR found his bank had listed him as a ‘clearout’-a debtor who doesn’t pay and can’t be located by the lender. Some years ago, while working in a remote area, MrR had got into arrears with his credit card payments, but he’d paid it off a short while later. At no time did his bank tell him it would list this incident on his credit report. In fact he was still using the same credit card. MrR complained to the Banking and Financial Services Ombudsman (BFSO), who found in his favour and put Mr R’s case in the BFSO annual report. Mr R’s credit report was cleared and he received $2000 compensation. The point with that case-for example, on the question of being a ‘clearout’, a debtor who does not pay and cannot be located by the lender-is that very basic issues and problems with your credit report, such as an incorrect listing of your address or your name, even if it is a minor adjustment, could lead to a situation where you could be accused of being a ‘clearout’. The report by Choice related to a survey of a number of Choice subscribers. It was not a huge number of subscribers but it did produce a huge result-that is, some 34 per cent of people who responded to the request to get their credit report found that their credit report actuMAIN COMMITTEE",135,Adjournment
210,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (10.59 A.m.),"I rise today to speak briefly about the issue of creditally contained errors. If you look at the overall size of this area in Australia, where we are looking at somewhere in the region of 14 million credit reports held on Australians, we could well be seeing somewhere between four and five million Australians with incorrect listings on their credit reports. That is in a situation where over 1.5 million of those reports have a default listing, so we are talking about an incredibly serious issue. The Office of the Federal Privacy Commissioner is the agency-from a government point of view-that deals with these issues with respect to complaints. We have recently seen some quite extraordinary comments by the Privacy Commissioner on this issue. I will quote from a recent ABC Canberra interview with Chris Uhlmann on 5 February. On the issue of the problems with this particular area, the commissioner, Mr Crompton, said: What has happened is that we have had a surprising response to the wider private sector privacy law that came into place a couple of years ago where our complaints workload has gone up five-foldquintupled. Unfortunately we were only funded for a doubling of the complaints workload before that came into place and we haven’t been given further funding. And then he said: Unfortunately it’s not getting any better. I really am sorry about that, but resource allocation is a challenge for any government, and those are the resources they have given us. What I’m responsible for is to make sure that the Government and the public are well aware of the implications of their resource decision making and this is one of those implications. … … … Quite seriously that is an issue for you to take up with the Attorney General or his staff, but the thing that I can say is that I have made them continuously aware of the issues from the moment the private sector privacy law started a couple of years ago. I have kept them continuously up-to-date, I have made the Attorney aware of the amount of money that I believe would be needed to begin to address this problem. How he has taken that forward is a matter for him to answer. It is pretty clear from a follow-up interview a week later that the Attorney has not done much at all. He has basically mentioned in his response to Mr Uhlmann’s questions that we have to look at this in a budget context. We have known about it for two years. He has then talked about the fact that there are some systemic issues here. What has he done about addressing those systemic issues? I note that he has actually said: ... I think the approach that CHOICE were taking in asking for a look at the systemic system involved in this sort of information was probably the correct one. Let us see him do something about it. It is about time the government did something about this issue. Fuel: Ethanol ter, Melissa Williams, have owned and operated a petrol station at Nowra in my electorate of Gilmore for the past 12 years. About four weeks ago they changed the petrol station trading name to Shoalhaven Ethanol Fuels. There is nothing new about that. Companies change their names all the time to improve the way that people think about their products and services and disassociate themselves from negative publicity or merely to avoid their financial responsibilities. However, the Sullivans are not motivated by those reasons. Instead, they wish to support one of our major industries in the local area and they wish to support a healthy environment for the Nowra area. MAIN COMMITTEE",136,Adjournment
211,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (11.04 A.m.),"Peter and Chandra Sullivan, along with their daughThey made this change amid a concerted campaign by Australian oil companies to vilify ethanol-and in the face of Labor’s scare campaign and its plan to tax ethanol at 38c per litre. The Sullivans are to be applauded for biting the bullet on ethanol. It is a brave move, especially with many other service stations pointedly displaying ‘no ethanol’ signage. Their petrol station has always served our community well, with competitively priced fuel and a fine reputation. The launch under the new branding was a good opportunity for me to revisit my early days of pumping petrol. It was also an opportunity to let people know that ethanol in fuel is great for the environment and for their health and is crucial for the work force in our community. Most of all, it is cheaper. A lot of people do not realise just how important it is. Literally hundreds of local jobs depend on it being sold. I am not afraid of promoting ethanol against those who seek to question its reliability. When people look at the facts on ethanol, it is obvious that the campaign against it seeks to play on people’s fears. Surely, if people were told the truth about the virtues of ethanol in fuel it would not be hard to appreciate the benefits of a clean-burning additive. In fact, it is the only fuel additive you can actually drink. Compare this to the harmful carcinogenic additives contained in other petrol. Even if Australians have not been scared by Labor’s campaign, they will surely think twice about the use of ethanol under Labor’s planned tax increases. In short, the tax increases will kill off Manildra in Bomaderry, costing many hundreds of jobs. For us in Gilmore the consequences are worse. Labor’s campaign has made it hard enough for Manildra to sell ethanol, and the tax will make things worse. If Manildra cannot shift its products, it stands to reason that it cannot continue. We are not just talking about what might happen if Labor were elected to government; their actions and position on this issue are already affecting employment in Gilmore. The ethanol plant is currently producing at only about 30 per cent of capacity in order to manage the rate of stockpiling and subsequent use of storage facilities. Production at 100 per cent of capacity could mean an increase of 30 to 40 jobs at the plant. The government put a zero tax on ethanol, and there is a 38c per litre excise on ethanol which is offset by a production subsidy to the Australian producers. Labor are planning to keep the excise but will take away the production subsidy, meaning that there will be a 38c per litre tax rise on ethanol. We are only just starting to turn our attention towards the next election and already under Labor’s policies we have had two tax rises that will hit hard in Gilmore with disastrous consequences. People need to know that this is Labor’s agenda. I applaud any production of ethanol that will occur in regional areas because it would be a much-needed employment boost for those communities. I again want to encourage the small business people of Australia who run petrol stations to stand up for their local communities, their health and their environment. Stand up against the oil companies’ self-interest and the self-serving Labor Party! Take your leave from Peter and Chandra Sullivan and Melissa Williams from my electorate of Gilmore! Their courage and leadership are an inspiration for the future of regional communities. No matter what their opposition, with the backing of the people of the region they have every chance of success. I applaud and admire their guts to have a go. Telstra: Staffing Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (11.09 a.m.)-I rise today to challenge Telstra to shelve its plans to allow 450 IT jobs to be exported to India. When it emerged last month that these jobs MAIN COMMITTEE would be sent offshore, Telstra washed its hands of the decision. It said it was purely the decision of its contractor, IBM. Telstra’s spokesperson, Bill Scales, said: This very large contract with IBM is really a matter for IBM and not for Telstra. But surely IBM was driven to this decision because of the tremendous pressure placed on it to cut costs? I understand that last year IBM lost Telstra business to the Indian based company Infosys because its competitor had cheaper wage rates. IBM may have felt it had no choice but to transfer those 450 jobs to IBM India so that revenue was still kept within the multinational organisation. Its actions are in some respects understandable. But how do we explain Telstra’s abandonment of Australian workers? We must remember, after all, that Telstra is one of the most profitable companies in the world. Just last Friday it announced an interim net profit of $2 billion. Telstra is still largely a monopoly, and it makes all its profits in the Australian telecommunications industry. We have only seen this week that its board is having deliberations about buying other rather large and profitable businesses. I understand that it needs to be internationally competitive, but surely that need should not come at the expense of Australian workers, Australian jobs or its future operations. The President of the Australian Computer Society, Richard Hogg, said there have been instances of some offshore projects failing and being brought back to Australia. Sending work offshore robs Australia of skills and the ability for people to enter the IT industry at the bottom and work their way up. You only need to look at enrolments at university in IT and CIT courses to understand that this movement of jobs offshore is currently having an impact on our skill base and the future job prospects of our youth. Mr Hogg also warns that companies that pioneered the outsourcing trend several years ago can attest to the fact that it is very difficult to recoup internal knowledge and skills lost through that process. He said that companies should be far more rigorous in their assessments of the benefits of offshore outsourcing. He adds: While the hourly rate paid to programmers in India might be as little as 10% of that of their US (or Australian) colleagues, the additional costs involved in vendor selection, contract management and staff redundancies, as well as reduced productivity for training offshore staff and dealing with cultural issues, can actually add between 10 and 50 percent to the contract price. A constituent of mine employed by IBM has written to me concerned that his job is at threat from the new IBM-Telstra contact. With the IT job market already depressed, he is anxious about the impact it will have on him and his family’s way of life. I quote from his email: I am also concerned about Australia’s ‘importing’ yet another service, increasing our reliance on the export of resources and agriculture, which both have a limited lifetime and are susceptible to drought and disease. I wonder what future opportunities will exist for our daughter. As my Member of Parliament, I request you and your colleagues revisit the Telstra decision in particular and offshore job loss in general and ensure that the issues are thoroughly debated. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future regarding your view on this issue and your intended actions. My intended action is to raise this most serious matter in the parliament today, because if we do not address these issues we will lose more jobs offshore-we have already seen it. We will lose the skill base, training and an area in which we have had success-importing components and manufacturing parts within the computer industry. If you do not have those jobs here you cannot support and foster that skill base. It is way past the time for Telstra to step in and say: MAIN COMMITTEE ‘We want to protect Australian jobs. We want to protect Australian livelihoods.’ We want the rot to stop. We are seeing these jobs go offshore. Time and time again, we have seen that these are not true cost savings and I ask Telstra to reconsider this issue. Foreign Affairs: Gallipoli Peace Park lutely shocked about, and I am sure our veteran community are shocked as well-that is, the possibility of the Turkish authorities charging a fee to enter Gallipoli national park. Last week when I first heard about this I was sure that I had misheard that statement, but the story was backed up by an article in the Daily Telegraph on 18 February on page 11, which claimed that Turkish authorities have been building an entrance gate to the park and that they insist a fee for entry is going ahead. The Turkish Ambassador to Australia, Tansu Okandan, issued a statement contrary to the reports, and I certainly hope that is right. But it does not stop the fact that they are building the gates as I speak. I am appalled and disgusted at this blatant exploitation by the Turkish government of the emotional connection many Australians have to this site. You cannot put a price on Gallipoli. This site has emotional and historical significance for many Australians and New Zealanders, and it is not a money-spinner for the Turkish government. ANZAC Day and Gallipoli are inseparable in the Australian psyche, and they represent many thousands of men and women of Australia who perished in times of war. ANZAC Day is about the events of Gallipoli and the landing on the beaches at dawn. It has become Australia’s memorial day, with a single event that gave Australia so much and took so much at the same time. ANZAC Day is about Gallipoli, which some say was the birthplace of our nation. I know it was the birthplace of the ANZAC spirit. Each year, more and more Australians, both young and old, visit Gallipoli on ANZAC Day to pay their respects to the fallen. They participate in the dawn service, right where things happened in 1915. Many people stay for a few days either side of ANZAC Day and spend on accommodation, in shopping centres and on eating-all of which contributes to the Turkish economy. But, disgracefully, the Turkish government ignores the major contributions that Australians make when they visit their country and they also ignore the contribution that the Australian government has made to create a monument to the ANZACs and in the ongoing maintenance and upkeep of that site. There is no need for the Turkish government to charge a fee on Gallipoli. Australia will look after the site to ensure the memory of our fallen heroes lives on forever. It is a small price to pay to remember that these men fought for our country and preserved the democracy we take so much for granted today. Charging a fee now is wrong. We might as well start to put in turnstiles on our cemeteries and make the cenotaph flame a coin-operated machine. I implore the Turkish government to consider the feelings of those Australians who seek to remember with respect their fathers and grandfathers who perished at this site. But they should also consider the emotional attachment that many Turkish sons, daughters and grandchildren have to this site, as Turkish blood was also spilled at Gallipoli. Their memory is not up for sale. The newspaper report claims that a fee will contribute to a $15 million upgrade of the Gelibolu Historic National Park and that Australians will therefore have to pay to attend a dawn service. The report is backed up by Ibrahim Kosdere, the member of parliament who represents that region in Turkey. He is quoted as saying: MAIN COMMITTEE",137,Adjournment
212,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (11.14 A.m.),"I would like to raise a matter which I am absoEntrances to national parks have fees and this is a natural thing … There is nothing more natural than taking admission fees from the international national park on the Gelibolu Peninsula. He went on to say: These people should know that every service has a cost ... It appears that someone should be telling that MP that the maintenance of the allied cemeteries in the park is done and it is funded by the Commonwealth government. Our own minister says that the Turkish MP is wrong and she says that she has been assured by Turkish authorities that there will be no fees for our Gallipoli ceremonies and that any fees in the park will be used for other facilities, like the reception centre. I certainly hope that the Turkish authorities honour that commitment and that Australians travelling to the Gallipoli Peace Park will not be charged fees to honour those Australians who gave their lives for this country. Respecting our heroes should not come at a cost. Enough of a price has been paid with their lives. Wills Electorate: Aged Care now in a state of crisis. In the Wills electorate, one-quarter of the population are aged over 55 years and 12 per cent are aged over 70 years. This ageing demographic profile places unique challenges on the provision of aged care services. Those challenges are made more serious by the fact that it is located in inner metropolitan Melbourne. SinceI have been the federal member for Wills, I have been party to many community discussions about aged care within my electorate. Since we met the challenge of the accommodation bonds back in 1996, I have been forced to watch this government-an idle government-complacently denying those calls from the aged care sector for more funding assistance while an increasing number of services and aged care beds have left my electorate. Now it seems, if media reports about the Hogan report are any indication, that after three terms in office the Howard government have no other plan or vision for aged care in Australia than to bring back accommodation bonds. Their fourth-term agenda is to go back to the agenda of term 1. In the latest funding allocations under the 2003 aged care approvals round, two facilities in the Wills electorate received new residential aged care allocations. Coburg Aged Care received 60 high-care places and St Basils Nursing Home received funding for 21 new low-care places. Initially I welcomed this announcement, but when you have a look at the figures, you see that Coburg Aged Care has been forced to close down its high-care facility in Wills because of ageing and inferior infrastructure. The 40 beds currently in operation will move out shortly to an alternative site. In addition, 40 low-care beds from Munro Manor will leave. That means that the 81 beds that were allocated turn into a net gain of one new bed, not 81. We have had a number of aged care providers miss out in the latest funding round despite having workable and well-planned submissions to help ease the burden that we confront. We need more beds, more facilities and better funding and assistance for our aged care providers in the Wills community as a matter of priority. It is not simply that we are not getting new beds; there are also beds closing. Last week we had the Salvation Army announce that it intends to divest itself of 15 of its 19 aged care facilities. This confirms that aged care under this government is in a state of crisis and is collapsing. In Coburg the Salvation Army’s Gilgunya Village comprises 50 low-care hostel style beds along with 12 two-bedroom independent living homes. It is a stone’s throw from major shopping and community services, it is close to public transport and it is only a few years old. The MAIN COMMITTEE",140,Adjournment
213,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (11.18 A.m.),"Aged care in the electorate of Wills isfact that the Salvation Army cannot continue to sustain the burden of operating these facilities speaks volumes about the aged care crisis in Australia. This follows the Church Nursing Home, operated by the Baptist Church in Brunswick, closing the year before. We have a long standing problem in relation to retaining facilities in inner metropolitan areas. The Salvation Army says it is committed to ensuring that the needs of Gilgunya residents are met. I want to work with them to try to ensure that that occurs. What we have here is inevitably high competition for limited land in inner metropolitan areas. That poses a challenge for aged care developers. People such as those associated with the Pentridge Piazza project have been interested in developing aged care services and facilities, but they have not been able to do it. Conversely, others have been moving out. I have talked about the Salvation Army. I have talked about the Church Nursing Home. Moreland Private Nursing Home moved its services 20 kilometres out of the electorate, to Sunbury. I am told by the government that this strategy is acceptable, but it makes a mockery of the government’s Ageing in Place policy. While the government has made a commitment to assist regional communities in providing suitable aged care facilities for older Australians, those living in inner metropolitan areas of our major capital cities are finding it equally difficult to access aged care services in the communities that they have lived in all their lives and want to go on living in. I am sure the government has had all these issues drawn to its attention through the Hogan review, but the government is continuing to stall and procrastinate on the release of the Hogan report. Speculation is that it is being held back because it talks about more user-pays systems. Unfortunately, as long as this government fails to release that report and sits on its hands, aged care facilities in my electorate are closing down and being relocated, and the aged care crisis continues. Australian Defence Force: Water Strategy FRAN BAILEY (McEwen-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (11.23 a.m.)-I think that every member in this place, people throughout our nation and certainly all the people in my electorate of McEwen know and value the role that our Australian Defence Force plays in our national security. But there is a role that our ADF plays that I think is not well known either inside or outside this place throughout communities across our nation, and that is the role that the ADF plays in sustainably managing the environment-not only the environment on their bases but also the environment that they train in off base. This morning, by way of illustration, I will talk about a very important strategy that, in my role as the parliamentary secretary, I had the great honour of launching two weeks ago. That strategy is the ADF’s national strategy on water. There are two aspects to the strategy. Firstly, it is providing education and information to all ADF members and their families on ways to conserve water and on how important water is in the communities in which they live-and let us not forget that most of our defence bases are located in regional Australia. Just as important as educating each and every one of our ADF personnel is actually putting that education into practice. The national water strategy is doing exactly that. It is not just talking about it; it is actually doing it. As I am speaking here now, this program is being implemented right across the bases, right across our nation. It starts from very small means, such as making sure that the trees planted on bases are trees that do not need to consume vast amounts of water; making sure that we put into practice the reuse of grey water; installing, for example, waterless urinals; and making MAIN COMMITTEE sure that the water stream that comes out of taps and shower roses is not distributing huge amounts of water. It came as a shock to me to learn that the ADF pays $13 million a year on potable water. Not only are we expecting to make some savings that can be put into other areas of defence but, most importantly, every single member of our Defence Force is actually making a commitment to practising sustainable environmental practices. The ADF, in putting into practice its sustainable environment programs, is streets ahead of some of the local water authorities, particularly a couple of water authorities in my electorate-the Goulburn-Murray water authority and the Goulburn Valley water authority. While defence members are certainly acting in very good conscience and being good managers of their environment and planning for the future, what are these local water authorities doing? They are still operating under very old charters that directly disadvantage the businesses, the homes and the families right across my electorate. I will use, for example, the tourist operators and businesses that depend on those businesses around Lake Eildon in my electorate of McEwen. Many of these businesses are paying licence fees for access to water. They have been paying these fees for years. There is still no access to water, but the water authorities are charging these licence fees. The same water authorities will not give licence arrangements for longer than five years. If businesses go to their bank managers and say that they have only got a licence arrangement for five years, what chance do they have to reinvest and build their businesses? They are being hamstrung-with not just one but two hands behind their backs. It is an absolute disgrace that these water authorities are allowed to practise under these charters. I am calling on the state government in Victoria to quickly act to change the charters under which these water authorities work and to take a leaf out of the book of the ADF in sustainable practices. Child Care very important to many Australian families, and that is the issue of child care. The Leader of the Opposition has talked about a ladder of opportunity, and of course the first rung on that ladder of opportunity is all about our infant children. Throughout my electorate of Oxley, and many like it across the country, people are trying to balance the pressures of family life and work and, more specifically, people are struggling to find adequate child-care places. People tell me that it is also becoming increasingly difficult to find adequate before and after school child care and child-care places generally. People tell me that child care and before and after school care is becoming more and more costly. Families struggling to achieve a balance between work and family work very hard and with great personal effort. But it also requires assistance from friends, family, the community and, importantly, from government. Sadly, the government is failing in its mutual responsibility to Australian families. The government is always talking about how it values Australian families, but where are the policies and the programs to support the rhetoric? Australia’s Welfare 2003, which was released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, shows how child care is becoming less and less affordable for Australian families. Since 1998, the Howard government have cut the number of centre based long day care places in Australia. There is now a national shortage of around 30,000 outside school hours care places and 2½ thousand places in family day care. Also, the cost of child care has increased. The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows the price of child care has gone MAIN COMMITTEE",141,Adjournment
214,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (11.28 A.m.),"TodayI would like to talk about an issue which isup by a massive 33 per cent since September 2000-after John Howard introduced his GST. The system is at absolute crisis point. Tens of thousands of working families cannot access quality, affordable child care. The government must not continue to patronise families and the sector with hollow words; they have to act now to ease the pain afflicting Australian families. The government-imposed cap on family day care and outside school hours care has created a critical shortage of more than 30,000 places. For young families, access to child-care services is as essential as work itself and should not be treated as a luxury. In many cases, the traditional methods of child care, such as care provided by the extended family, are no longer viable options for young people struggling to build a family and purchase their first home, or for ageing parents who no longer live nearby or who themselves need support services. The need to work is not an option. Families work because they must to survive, and to work they must have access to affordable and quality child care. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister still holds the view that women should stay at home to look after the kids. He has said this repeatedly. That may have been the accepted norm back in the fifties and sixties, but as the world has changed so has the traditional family, its core values and the need to work. It is more common and acceptable, if not purely out of need, that families are usually made up of two working parents or a single parent that must work. The choice if you do not do this is to become part of the government’s failed welfare system. Originally this was intended to assist families and children, but now it is more programmed at saving money and punishing hard working families. But the story gets worse with single parents often left with very little choice but to raise young families while juggling work and family, with little or no community support and very little assistance from government. Recent comments of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs reflect the broader approach by government and that of John Howard’s 1950s view of work and family. He has made comments over many years that families do not need child care if the woman stays at home. That would solve the problems of the government because it would not have to spend more money on child-care services. This attitude of the government is further reflected in the access to child-care places and in the funding models used by the Howard government to support families. A new positive approach needs to be taken, an approach that acknowledges not only the physical need for child care but also the benefits that quality and affordable child care brings to families and the wider community-a new approach that recognises, through funding, the need to support families struggling to balance their work and their life, particularly in the area of early development for their children. We also need to recognise that families are not the traditional nuclear families of the 1950s. Unless we take urgent steps now, we will face an ever-growing desperation of families to gain access to child-care places and the ongoing stress that it causes them and the problems that follow. Strengthening families and assisting children in the early years must be a priority for government, and it must be a priority to provide these essential services. Labor have put a number of policy issues on the table to do with our commitment to families. It is about making sure we get a real pay rise for working families and taking care of bracket creep. It is about making sure we have fairer family payments for working families. It is about ensuring that there is paid maternity leave and addressing the great need for that which families are facing. It is about better access to child care. It is about better services for all families. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Hinkler Electorate: Barry Hough berg, and every Thursday night the rhythmic beat of drums wafts across the paddocks, the cane fields and the streets of Kalkie. Sometimes joyous and sometimes, on windy nights, even eerie, it is a potent image of children at music. They are young volunteers, at or below grade 7 standard, honing their musical skills and building on a great tradition of 32 years in a school which has 126 years of history. The Kalkie State School band, with its bright blue and gold uniforms and its shining drums, is a familiar sight at parades, processions and carnivals not just in Bundaberg but further afield across south-eastern Queensland. This was the vision of Barry Hough: schoolteacher, leader, drum master, puppeteer, service club contributor and one who never lost his fascination with creation and man’s endless inventiveness. This was the universal view in the Bundaberg community and was beautifully recalled, following Barry’s death on 18 January, at his funeral service in the Bundaberg civic centre. His life was commemorated by Pastor Brian Robinson, his son-in-law; his children, David, Terry, Caroline, Suzanne and Julie; his grandchild; and also a Lions Club colleague Stewie Holden. Barry Hough taught at Kalkie State School for 29 years, and he made a tremendous contribution to the personal and musical development of many students. He established the Kalkie school band in 1972. He was its bandmaster for 32 years and only retired when his health failed and he could no longer continue. On top of this, Barry was a great service club man. He was a member of the Jaycees movement for eight years. He put a full decade into the Bundaberg surf lifesaving movement and for 25 years he was a member of the South Bundaberg Lions Club. Not only did he run the marvellous school band but, as a member of these organisations, he was also instrumental in running several high-profile festivals, including Bundy in Bloom and the Pageant of Lights. He undoubtedly helped lift the profile of the city in terms of tourism not just at home but also, by taking the band to other carnivals, throughout the state. The extent of his support ran to things like being parade marshal for 35 years in the Bundaberg district. He also had a keen eye for beauty. He had a collection of dolls that went on public display for many yearsHough’s House of Dolls was one of the seminal collections in Bundaberg and a great tourist attraction. One of the most touching things at his funeral was his children, who said that their dad, although they were not rich, introduced them to every conceivable type of human experience and attraction. If he could not afford a caravan, he converted his own station sedan by inventively making beds that fitted within it. It was very touching to hear his children talk about how inventive their father was in engaging them with every one of life’s experiences. Barry Hough was a truly remarkable man. He was kind, decent and involved with people, especially young people. He had great family values, and he stretched out to people in the community as well. I would like to record my deepest sympathy and that of the Hinkler electorate to his wife, Joan; to his children, David, Terry, Caroline, Suzanne and Julie; and to the teachers and faculty of Kalkie State School, including Lindsay Cunnean, the principal, and Jill Hurst, the deputy principal. It was fitting that he went out to the beat of the drum-the beat of the muffled drum. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 11.38 a.m. MAIN COMMITTEE",143,Adjournment
