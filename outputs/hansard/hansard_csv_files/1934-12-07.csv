Orable Member For Franklin ( Mr Frost) Asked Whether The Government Of Tas","mania had been invited to be represented at the conference which is to consider the unification of railway gauges. I have since verified the impression that I had -*B6 the time that an invitation was not issued in this case. The exclusion of the Government of Tasmania from the conference was not aimed at, but, not being directly concerned in the matter of a uniform gauge on the mainland, it was thought that that Government would not desire representation. Should it wish to be represented, its delegates will be welcome. and recommendations of the Tariff Board on the following subjects:Carbon Tetrachloride. Citric Acid. Coir Matting. Copper and Copper Products. Dwarf Essex Rape Seed. Electric Heating and Cooking Appliances; Electric Smoothing Irons. Electrical Machines and Appliances; Electrical Fittings and Accessories. Felspar. Glucose. Handworked Inflators of all kinds. High Tension Ignition Coils. Iron and Steel Hoop. Iron and Steel Tubes or Pipes, not more than three inches internal diameter; Iron and Steel Boiler Tubes.

That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday next, at 3 p.m. or three parliaments the Government has shown a disposition to have only one session of a number of periods, instead of periodical prorogations and new sessions. I ask the Prime Minister to state whether the Government favours reversion to the practice of annual sessions, which was followed for a very lengthy period in the history of Australia, and the rejection of the pernicious practice to which I have referred? recent practice can be accurately described as "" pernicious"", nor that it has less merit than that followed for a number of generations in Great Britain and Australiat So long as there is business to be done, and the circumstances are such as were associated recently with the consideration of tariff schedules, there is no possibility of avoiding the continuance of a session. If the business can be so arranged that the former practice may be reverted to, the Government will be only too pleased to adopt that course. able member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson), asked a question in regard to the issue of federal income",11,Setup

Further inquiry shows that no federal income tax assessments have yet been issued, and that none w ill be sent out prior to Christmas. The assessments referred to by the honourable member were those of the State of New South Wales. Commerce state when a decision w ill be made in regard to the allocation of the £500,000, portion of the £4,000,000 to be made available for assistance to wheat growers, which is to be utilized in the immediate relief of cases of acute distress ? that a discussion shall take place between the chairman of the Wheat Commission nnd tbe State authorities as to the best means of dealing with the matter. Action will be taken to give effect to whatever is decided. of the Ministerf o r Commerce yesterday, that the wheat-growers relief money w ill be paid through the States, can the right honourable gentleman say whether the payments w ill be made directly to the growers, or if paid through the State government departments, whether those who owe money to the States, w ill be prejudiced? of the Government is that the money shall be paid directly to the growers. ing Herald yesterday published a message from Darwin concerning pearl fishing in the waters of Northern Australia. It readsMr Mark Aitken, a pearler, of Thursday Island, who put into Darwin to-day, said that the Japanese were increasing their pearling boats operating off the coast of Northern Australia . . . The Japanese on the grounds were operating about sixteen ketches. These were much larger than the Australian boats, which numbered nearly twenty . . . After staying two days the motor vessel left. That refers to a vessel which carried a party of scientists and Japanese government officials, who visited the grounds and made investigations. The message continuesHe heard afterwards that it was a patrol boat frem the Pellew Group of islands, near the Philippines, over which the Japanese exercise a mandate. It was the opinion of pearlers . . . that Japanese vessels had been poaching in Australian waters. The 'Japanese were placing new boats on the grounds every year. C a n the Ministerf o r I ask the Ministerf o r .the Interior to state what efforts are being made to prevent Japanese boats from entering the creeks of the Northern Territory and the north-west of Australia? partly the Department of Trade and Customs and partly the Department of the Interior. The last Government decided to either build or purchase three patrol* boats, one to operate in Darwin waters, one near Thursday Island, and one in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. The arrangements for their purchase or construction have not yet been completed. In view of the statement The policy of the Government is definitely to investigate any poaching that may be taking place in Australian waters. MrA . GREEN -Action was promised eighteen months ago. reports which come from the north are found, when probed, to be inaccurate. The Department of Trade and Customs seized a boat at Thursday Island last year, and the captain of it was fined. A second boat was seized in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, and the crew were imprisoned. The Government is alive to the difficulties of the situation, and when the patrol boats are available further steps will be taken to minimize the activities of poachers.

The Government, like all its predecessors, is prepared at all times to give the fullest information within reason to the Parliament and the -country; but there are times when the cost of obtaining the information asked for is greater than is justified.

Upon the return of the summons, the court may inquire whether the defendant is a near relative and able to support the child, and if it is satisfied on these points, it may make a maintenance order against him. It is obviously desirable that the provisions of the Service and Execution of Process Act shall enable the service of processes to be made in such cases. As tie Commonwealth act does not appear precisely to cover them the Government of that State has invited the Commonwealth to amend the law to remove the anomaly, and the Government is quite willing to do so.

As far as it is within my power to do so, I shall not consent to this ParI would gladly relieve the people. liament facilitating the application of a bad law of a State-or , indeed, of any law of a State-unti l I have fully informed myself whether I agree with its provisions. For instance, a government of the character now in office in New South Wales may pass legislation seriously infringing the rights of certain citizens, and may then approach this Parliament with success for an alteration of the existing legal process to enable the application of that law to residents of New South Wales, no matter where they may be found, throughout the Commonwealth. under the measure who might desire to leave the State in order to escape the incidence of that law and remain absent until it was amended might be pursued by means of Commonwealth legislation. As I was remarking, I approach the consideration of this measure with no knowledge of whether the Queensland law is good or bad. The House ought reasonably to be fully informed on that aspect of the question before it permits the application of that law by any process to any other part of Australia. It should not be greatly influenced by the. claim that this bill seeks to cheapen the process of applying a particular law gassed in Queensland. The observations of the Attorney-General( Mr Menzies) in this respect may lead us to feel that those likely to benefit from the operation of this legislation are usually of the poorer classes. Probably the majority likely to be affected are in that category. that act a near relative of a legitimate member hold that a citizen of a State should be able to avoid his obligations under a particular law passed in that State? in my opinion, upon the kind of law under which such a citizen sought to avoid his obligations. State itself would, I suggest, be the proper judges as to whether the law was fair or unfair. exercise my own judgment in that regard. For instance, there are many laws operating in New South Wales of which I would be entitled to take that course just as much as the honourable member is entitled to defend his point of view on any subject which comes up for discussion in this House. Therefore I hold that I should not be a party in this Parliament to any action designed to facilitate the application of some law which, upon examining it, I might hold to be an unjust law, or one not based on equity or on the best principles by which I think the people should be governed. The Queensland law in this case may, upon examination, be found to be satisThus, citizens suffering factory. But I have no knowledge of what it is. The point I emphasize is that, by passing this bill without the fullest deliberation, a precedent may be established. State governments will understand that, after passing a certain law, it will be an easy matter to facilitate its application throughout the Commonwealth, merely by asking the Commonwealth Attorney-General to bring down a bill such as has been done in this case. Before providing such facilitation of process, the House must be satisfied that the law under consideration is just and equitable and is one which, in the opinion of a majority of honourable gentlemen 'in this chamber, can justly be applied to all States throughout the Commonwealth. Queensland law involved in this matter is the State Children Act of 1911. Under child is defined as the "" father, mother, the honourable step-father, step-mother, brother, sister and grandparent""; and that of an illegitimate child as "" the mother, and the person admitting himself to be, or adjudged by a competent court to be, the father "". Section 50 of this act provides that a magisterial order of liability to pay or contribute towards the maintenance of a legitimate child can be made against the ""father, mother, step-father or stepmother "" and in the case of an illegitimate against the "" father or mother"".

If one a neglected child, but the question now State departs radically from accepted arises as to whether we should depart standards or principles of legislafrom that principle by facilitating the tion, we cannot do anything to application of a law which provides that certain people should be made responsible for the upkeep of the child for whom they are not really responsible. Thousands of cases might arise in which people would be compelled to contribute towards the upkeep of a child, although they are not justly responsible for the economic position of that child. This Parliament might not want to do that, it easier for a State to do so. I do not think any honorahle gentleman would be averse to facilitating the operation of a law throughout the Commonwealth which limited the responsibility for the upkeep of children to parents. I can imagine cases arising in which, under a State law, a magistrate could, and would, compel struggling working people to accept responsibility for a neglected child and subscribe to its maintenance, I appreciate the point although such an order might impose hardship upon the children of the relatives against whom the order was made. I do not think we should facilitate the application of a law which would have that effect.

Section 15 of the present Commonwealth act is free from the danger to which I have referred, because it is made clear that the person against whom the summons is to be issued must have committed the offence or incurred the liability in Queensland. There may be nothing in the point I have raised; but we should give ourselves time to examine the matter thoroughly in order to determine whether there is or not. court hold a resident of another State liable? tainly intended to enable proceedings to be served on a person living in another State. If a member of the Queensland community leaves that State in order to evade his obligations under Queensland law, it is right that Queensland law should be able to follow him in the way proposed in this bill; but the question is whether we are not making it possible to apply Queensland law to residents of another State who were never citizens of Queensland. In view of all the circumstances, I trust that the Attorney General will agree to an adjournment of the debate, in order to enable the points raised to be considered. General) [11.46] -The discussion on on the part of some honourable members to appreciate the true significance of In my legislation of this nature. The question raised by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) is whether the law in Queensland operates against persons. who are not residents of that State, and how far under the Queensland act of 1911 it would be possible for the Queensland Crown to make an order against some person who was definitely and permanently resident in another State. There are two observations which I should like to make on that point. The first is that when there is State legislation, particularly of this type, it must, prima facie, in accordance with very well-established principles of interpretation, be read as being directed to the citizens of that State. Assuming that to be wrong, and that the Queensland act does in fact address itself to the liabilities of persons not resident in Queensland, my second observation is that anything we do in this Parliament can have no effect upon it. All that we are concerned in doing is to determine whether we shall complete the machinery, put into motion many years ago, of facilitating the service and execution of process between one State and another. If in considering a service and execution of process bill we paused to determine how far we should approve or disapprove of any State law that would be enforced as a result of the process, we should become involved in what might eventually prove to be a hopeless tangle. ourselves up as a high court of appeal. the powers conferred upon this Parliament is expressly related to this subjectUnder section 51 of the Constitution, paragraph XXIV . , the Commonwealth Parliament is empowered to make laws forThe service and execution throughout the Commonwealth of the civil and criminal process and tlie judgments of the courts of the States.

State, in relation to another, was for this purpose a foreign country, with the result that the gravest abuses arose. Persons escaped their obligations, not only under the laws, but also under the processes of the courts, by removing from one State to another. This was particularly so in thecase of persons against whom orders had been made in matrimonial causes. Husbands who had deserted their wives or fathers their children could, regardless of their financial position, avoid their obligations by merely transferring across the border. made in the Pederal Constitution that the Commonwealth Parliament should have power to legislate so that the writ should run with perfect ease from one end of Australia to the other-processe s of all kinds, the enforcement of judgments of all kinds. If we refer to the Service and Execution of Process Act we find for example in section 14 that any writ, notice, decree, or other process required to be served on any party or person may be served on such party or person in any other State or part of the Commonwealth. That power, which has existed for years, has been extremely valuable, and yet in the writs which have been served State laws have been invoked which might have been roundly condemned by large sections of this Parliament; but this Parliament has deliberately abstained from inquiring into the wisdom or unwisdom of the law concerned for the good reason that it is its business to attend to its own the Parliament of a State has sole power law making, and it is equally its business to respect the right of a State to make its own laws for its own purpose. same people. powers are quite distinct. which I have referred was passed by the laws in relation to the maintenance of Queensland Government, and this amendchildren, through the indirect means of ing bill is submitted because of repremaking it difficult to have those laws sentations made by and information carried out."" reoeived from the present Queensland Government, which I should have thought would be scarcely likely to desire somfrthing unduly oppressive.

121,Mr Menzies,"I bow to the honorcase we would also be prejudging a decision of the court by preventing a matter coming to a hearing. the last point with which I wished to deal. When process is issued against a man it is in the first place issued against are conferred upon the Commonwealth, him because it is thought that some complaint exists against him. Whether that complaint is well founded or ill founded is to be determined by a proper tribunal, and it is most important that the process of determining it should be facilitated, made cheap and prompt. Another class for consideration is'that in which an order has bility of citizens of certain States avoidbeen made, and the liability determined, but the person concerned has slipped across the border. In those circumstances I doubt whether anybody would suggest that it should be made difficult to recapture him and make him face up to his obligations. By passing legislation of this character we do not propose to deal with the liability at all. We do not create the liability, and we do not express any opinion upon it. All that we do is to provide that a valid State law in which the social will of that State is expressed shall, under the general power given to this Parliament by the Constitution, be made effective throughout Australia from the point of view of administration and service. stage, will the Attorney-General undertake to satisfy himself and the House that there is no doubt as to the point raised that a State law may apply to residents of another State. there is anything in the point raised by the honourable member for Bourke, but I suggest that the bill be carried through to the report stage, and meanwhile I shall give the subject further consideration. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clause1 agreed to. Clause2 (Service of summons for complaint in any part of the Commonwealth). Downs) [11.58] -It has been suggested that by passing this bill the application of the State legislation may be extended beyond the confines of the State, but' I remind the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) that the subject must be studied from the view-point of the powers possessed by the States prior to federation. It is clear that the powers of the Commonwealth are limited. By the Constitution certain specific powers and speaking generally those powers which the Commonwealth does not possess are still retained by the States. The Commonwealth possesses only those powers which were specifically conferred upon it by the Constitution, but at the same time it was realized that there was a possiing legal obligations by passing from one State to another. It was also realized with closer union that means for service and the execution of process beyond a State should be provided, and with that in view, paragraph 24 of section 51 was inserted in the Constitution. As the Attorney-General( Mr Menzies) has clearly pointed out, the object of that paragraph is not to extend the area of the legislation possessed by the different States or their jurisdiction so far as the rights, duties and liabilities of their citizens are concerned. That power of legislating within a State was left entirely to the States. But it was deemed desirable to have a simple and expeditious procedure for the service and execution throughout the ..Commonwealth of the civil and criminal process and judgments of the courts of the States. In the present instance tbe Queensland Government is asking this Parliament to give fuller effect to the paragraph in the Constitution governing it. This provision was inserted to enable the Commonwealth to work in conjunction with the States, but was never intended to confer upon the Commonwealth a power to he exercised by way of supervision in respect of legislation passed by the States. If such a power were exercised by the Commonwealth, this Parliament would have to be continually revising this federal legislation according to the changed circumstances of the time. mind as to what obstacles it could put in the way of the States.

127,Mr Brennan,"And exercising itstbe wisdom OT otherwise of State legislation. that the Commonwealth Parliament should use the power it possesses under paragraph 24 as a blocking power, whereas the object of that paragraph is to facilitate the operation of the State legislation. Take the case of a person who has never been a resident of Queensland. It is not intended by this amending bill to extend the application of State legislation over people who have not been subject in any way to that State. If the honourable member for Bourke will look more closely into the bill he will see that no authority is given to extend the jurisdiction of the State. Therefore the position in that respect is perfectly safe. Simply because members may differ from a State law is no reason why they should not approve of the general enabling power in clause 2 of this bill. It does not purport to define uniform legislation for the States. It extends the federal act so that action can be taken against a person of ""whom complaint is made under any law of the State relating to the care and maintenance of children, and such person being a relative of any child to whom that law applies, is liable under that law to pay or contribute towards the present or past maintenance of the child. It is set out in general terms. It could not possibly extend by any implication the meaning OT extent of any particular State legislation. It simply provides that, in respect of the State laws enacted the procedure for enforcement provided by this act may apply. Honourable members will see that the Queensland act itself is within the legislative sphere of the State. It is well drafted, contains nothing that can be seriously questioned, and, in its operation, does much good. It seeks to enforce the principle that, where relatives are in a position to contribute they should be compelled to do so. The principle involved in this bill is whether it is the duty of this Parliament to provide adequate machinery designed to enforce the legislation of the States as contemplated by the Constitution. This clause is quite a reasonable one, and I commend it to honourable members. With regard to much of what has been said I am in complete agreement. I agree that we have no right to prevent any State Yet the suggestion is from enforcing its law against its own subjects, even if those subjects have attempted to evade their liabilities by departing to another State. We have no right to set ourselves as censors of the States. But there is a possibility, if this legislation is passed in its present form, of a Queensland court being enabled to issue a summons against, a person resident in another State, compelling him to attend that Queensland court, aud make an order against him if he should obey that summons and attend the court. The Commonwealth has power to legislate in the matter of maintenance of children in connection with marriage, and it has power to say that the whole of the Commonwealth shall be considered as one unit for this purpose; but it has never attempted to do so. Nevertheless it should assist a State to enforce whatever legislation it has on this subject, upon persons which are its own residents, even though fortuitously, or in an attempt to evade the law, they are then in another State. The point I am endeavouring to make is this: It may be that there are persons not residents of Queensland and who have never been residents of Queensland whom the State of Queensland may attempt to affect by this legislation. Section 15 as it now stands provides that a person shall not have a summons served upon him extra-^State unless he has committed something in the nature of an offence in the State by which the summons is issued. But this provision is much wider and under it a person who has not been a resident of Queensland maybe dealt with. This difficulty might be overcome by inserting the words "" being a resident of a State"". Residence is a permanent connection. I am not suggesting that these are the best words, but I do think that there is considerably more in the point which I have raised than was conceded by the Attorney-General. -In order that the Committee might determine this question and not permit the bill to reach a stage beyond its control, I intend to move that a new subclause be inserted providing that application of the process shall not a,pply to other than residents of Queensland.",23,Service And Execution Of Process Bill 1934
128,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [12.5],,24,Service And Execution Of Process Bill 1934
129,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [12.10].,"Thii amendment is designed to ensure that the methods of process which Parliament proposes to apply shall not affect other than those persons to whom the Queensland law actually applies. It would remove any doubt as to its application, for instance, to the residents of New South Wales, who may be near relatives of the Queensland parties concerned. The point I am making has already been established by the Attorney General( Mr Menzies) that no amendment of the Oommonwealth law should be permitted which infringes the principle that certain State laws have particular reference to the people of the State. My amendments makes that clear. The Attorney-General stated that in the usual interpretation of the law the practice is to say "" such and such is the case"", can do is to insert the amendment I have but the honourable gentleman qualified that by saying, "" If there is any doubt, so-and-so is the case."" As to the application of the law, it is a question of the hands into which its interpretation is entrusted. One legal man may give one opinion, another may give quite a different interpretation. ever language we use in our law. rently it does not matter what we determine in Parliament. It is a question of into whose hands the interpretation of the law is entrusted. One authority may place one construction on the written word of the law and another may give an entirely different interpretation of the same law. In that regard it is very fitting that I should make comment at this stage on the active interference of the Oommonwealth with the rights of the States. Much has been said in regard to the interference by the Commonwealth with the rights of the States: that we should not interpose or place obstacles in the application of State laws; that our powers should be confined to matters within our own province. But the determining factor in that regard is the government of the day. For instance, the Constitution of the Upper House of a State legislature has nothing whatever to do with the 'Commonwealth, but one Commonwealth government saw fit to intervene when New South Wales proposed to remove its Legislative Council. The revenue r>f the Commonwealth was used for the purpose of briefing legal opinion abroad to take steps to prevent the abolition of the Council. It all boils down to the fact that is rests on the government of the clay to say that the Commonwealth has certain rights under the Constitution, or to twist and wriggle the meaning of words to suit its own purpose. We therefore reach no finality; the whole problem is a hopeless one. Each authority applies its own interpretation; it all depends on which political party is in power at the moment. The case of the New Soutli Wales Legislative Council maybe cited as evidence of this. The opinions of individuals in this Parliament outside of the Government are held in little regard; but if words meau anything the best we suggested iu the hope that they may be interpreted along the lines we desire. J move That the following new sub-aection be added:.""Application of this process shall not apply to any other than residents of Queensland."" apply to anybody if that amendment were agreed to. think that the committee agrees that this Parliament should not act as a high court of appeal on any State legislation. The fact that we allow processes to be served does not indicate that we either approve or disapprove of the legislation of a particular State. I sympathize to a great extent with some of the protests made by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), who spoke of the Commonwealth interference witli regard to State affairs; yet that does not warrant us in further interfering in other directions. There is always a Nemesis when we go beyond our own authority. I favour one sovereign authority, and I believe that it should be vested in the Commonwealth; but, while we have a federation, we must respect the sovereign rights of every State, and the rights of each to pass its own laws. We are bound to facilitate the processes of the laws of the States. I suggest to the honourable member for West Sydney that the word "" resident "" is capable of so many interpretations that it may destroy the whole process",24,Service And Execution Of Process Bill 1934

The trend of the discussion has shown that the laws of a State should not be applicable to persons other than residents of that State. I emphasized the point by quoting a declaration by the Attorney-General himself on this matter. He went on to say that, according to the interpretation of the law by those empowered to interpret it, the statutes of a State apply only to the residents of that State. My amendment is in conformity with that principle. I have no desire to enable a father to evade his responsibilities to his family. The Leader of the Opposition said that, by crossing over the borders of a State a man could escape from family responsibilities by becoming a resident of another State, and he added that my amendment would enable him to evade his obligations.

The Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Casey) told us that this measure was introduced as a result of certain doubts raised in a case pending in the High Court as to whether it was not the duty of an informant in a prosecution under any of these acts to name the act which he alleged to have been infringed. Because of that doubt, the honourable gentleman, taking time by the forelock, has introduced in this bill a clause which says that the Commissioner may, at his option, either demand a return under all acts, or a return under any separate act he pleases to name. The Assistant Treasurer says that this measure is in aid of the taxpayers. From that point of view, it seems to me that it is not, since a taxpayer has first of all to make a general return under all the acts, and! then may he called upon to make a return under one special act. That means that the taxpayer is not to be freed, as he ought to be, from the burden of keeping separate books in respect of all the acts. it not be The best course to follow would be to make a general provision that he shall be called upon to furnish one return, and shall not be called upon to furnish returns under separate acts. Under this bill as it stands, the taxpayer will still have to keep several sets of books; he might have to keep as many as nine. It is also clear that the procedure clauses of the nine acts are to remain in force. It will be possible for the Commissioner to elect whether he will proceed under one of the existing acts, or whether he will proceed under the new consolidated procedure laid down by this measure. That is not desirable. The hill should substitute a new form of prorepeal the clauses that relate to returns and penalties under the nine several assessment acts. For some reason or other that is not done. There are, however, directions in which the bill does I say "" attempts"", because, benefit the taxpayer. For instance, if we compare clause 11 of this bill with sections 48 and 49 of the corresponding Apparently it is No. 1 act we shall see that the burden of the penalty is by this bill lightened considerably. Formerly, I think it was possible to collect a triple penalty for any infringement. It is now proposed that such shall be done only where the maximum penalty has to be applied. In that respect the bill will benefit the taxpayer, and, subject to what I have said and to what I want to say, it seems to me to be unobjectionable. But I should like the Government to consider the advisability of making a clean sweep of",27,Service And Execution Of Process Bill 1934

I should like it also to consider the desirability of dispensing with the power to require a return to be made under any of the old acts. If that be done, the taxpayer will have only one act to look at; he will kuow exactly his obligations and will have only one set of books to keep. Another point, which is really a matter for the committee, is that, under the original Sales Tax Assessment Act, it was provided that a person who was proceeded against under section 45 for making or delivering a return false in any particular, or making any false answer, whether verbally or in writing, might plead in defence that he had done so i'gnorantly or inadvertently. The burden of showing that it was done wilfully did not rest with the prosecution, but the defendant was permitted by the old legislation to defend himself by showing that, although he had made a false return, he had done so ignorantly or inadvertently. That particular provision was repealed by this Parliament during the present year. the debates I find, however, that the attention of the House was not directed to the fact that that change was being made. In this House the repeal bill was passed through all stages rather summarily. The Minister gave honourable members a memorandum on the subject in his explanatory speech, but did not draw attention to the fact that the amendment would take away from the taxpayer the right, to plead that the false statement rmade by him had been made ignorantly or inadvertently. In my opinion that provision should be re-inserted. I have shown the Assistant Treasurer an amendment that will be moved in committee to reinstate the old provision of the assessment act in that regard. Every one should agree that a man who has made a false statement, ignorantly or inadvertently, should be permitted to give evidence of that fact, and that if he can successfully prove it, he should not be convicted of an offence. Even'if this provision be restored, there will still be a penalty upon the defendant, because, under section 46 of the principal act, to which clause 8 of .this bill corresponds, a man is liable, if he has made a false statement, to pay double the tax. He has first of all to pay the tax, then he has to pay double the amount by which he has defrauded the department, with a maximum of £1. I regard that is a perfectly adequate punishment for making an inadvertent or ignorant statement, and I do not wish to modify it in any way. I do not suggest that in such a case the defence of ignorance or inadvertence should apply; but I do not think that a man who has made a false statement, ignorantly or inadvertently, should have a conviction recorded against him. man makes a mistake against himself? upon the meaning of the word, "" false "". Apparently, he can be convicted; but I do not think the Commissioner would prosecute a man who had injured himself by a mistake. is really a inatter for committee. Subject to the points I have raised, I see no objection to the bill. On looking through Sitting suspended from 1245 to 2.15 p.m. surer) [2.15] -The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) raised a number of points which I might be allowed to deal with at this stage. PerhapsI can satisfy the honourable member by amplifying somewhat the remarks which I made when moving the second reading. There are two main subdivisions of taxpayers under our sales tax legislation. The basic principle of the law is that persons shall pay sales tax on the sale price of goods. Generally speaking, sales tax transactions of this nature are dealt with in Sales Tax Acts Nos. 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7, so clearly there is no logical reason for asking taxpayers to dissect transactions made under any of these five acts. There is another class of transaction: that under which a person buys or makes goods and applies them to his own use: this class is dealt with on a different basis. In this case the tax is paid not on the sale price of the goods, because usually there is no sale price, but on various bases according to the origin of the goods. Where, however, sales tax on",28,Casey

167,Mr Casey (Corio,"Assistant Treatransactions of this kind is collected under acts Nos. 4 and 8, it is payable on the same basis, viz., the purchase price of the goods. Clearly again in respect of this class of goods there is no reason, from the point of view of the department, why the taxpayers should be 'required to dissect the transactions. But when a taxpayer is required to pay sales tax under any one or more of acts Nos. 1, 2, .3, 6 or 7, and also under acts Nos. 4 and 8,. in respect of which the tax is based on different calculations of value, it has in the past been necessary to dissect the transactions, and it will still be necessary in the future in order to make it clear to the department whether he is paying tax under any of acts Nos. 1, 2, 3, 6 or 7, or under acts Nos. 4 or 8. I offer this explanation because there appears to be some misapprehension in the minds of honourable members concerning the points raised by the honourable member for Bourke. The honourable gentleman also pointed out, and rightly so, that this bill seeks to reduce the minimum penalty for tax evasions. Under the principal act it is possible for the department to secure for gross cases of evasion, a minimum penalty of £50, and a maximum penalty of £500, plus three times the amount of tax evaded. This bill fixes the minimum penalty at £50, plus the amount of tax evaded, and the maximum penalty at £500, plus three times the amount of tax evaded. Thus there has been a lightening of the penalty for offences committed under these acts. The honourable member for Bourke also criticized the inclusion in this bill of sub-paragraph b of clause 6, under which the Commissioner may, by notice in writing, call upon any person to furnish to himA return -which shall be a return under, subject to the provisions of, and in the form prescribed under, any Sales Tax Assessment Act. The honourable gentleman went on to say that as we propose to take what may be regarded as overriding powers in this umbrella-like machinery bill, it should not be necessary for the Commissioner to retain his powers in this respect under the individual Sales Tax Assessment Acts. I may explain that the Commissioner would only take advantage of the Mr Casey. provision in paragraph 6 of elause 6 in cases where taxpayers failed to furnish returns or where they furnished returns which were incomplete-in other words, default returns. In these cases it would be necessary for the Commissioner to require such separate returns before he could issue default assessments under the various acts affected. I give the honourable member for Bourke and the House generally an assurance that this provision in the bill will be invoked only in cases of default returns. We have been advised by a most competent authority that it is necessary to retain this power. The honqrable member intimated that when the bill was in committee he would propose to re-insert in the act the provision repealed in an amending measure passed last session, enacting that it would be a good defence if the taxpayer pleaded ignorance of the law or that the offence was committed inadvertently. prove that the offence was due to inadvertence or ignorance of the law. removed from the act because of the opportunity which it gave to dishonest taxpayers to evade the law. In one case, a taxpayer claimed that his return had been furnished by his agent, and that he had had no personal knowledge of the business. When his claim was investigated, it became evident that there had been, over a number of years, gross and persistent under-statement of sales by the taxpayer in question. I believe it was established that had he given the slightest attention to his business, it would have been clear to him that his agent was acting against the law, and that in consequence the revenue was being defrauded. It was clear from that and other cases which came under the notice of the department that the provision enabling taxpayers to plead ignorance or inadvertence was being grossly abused by some taxpayers, and it was thought to be in the interests of the revenue and of those taxpayers who furnished accurate returns and paid sales tax, that it should be expunged from the act. If the honourable member seeks further information on this point, I shall be pleased",29,Casey

Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and committed pro forma. In committee: BILL 1934. surer) [2.30] I move That the bill be now read a second time. It has fallen to my lot to handle this measure, which seeks to make a small amendment to the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1923-30. In an attempt to assist honourable members, I have caused to be circulated a memorandum which shows more clearly than does the bill itself the alterations proposed to be made in the act. The bill applies only to the Commonwealth sinking fund, and in no way to either State sinking funds or the financial agreement. Sinking fund contributions are designed to liquidate the postal debt in 30 years, and other debts in 50 years, and are respectively at the rate of 30s. per cent, and 10s. per cent. Payments into the sinking fund are made annually, and are used to purchase securities in the market and to redeem debt. Such securities as are acquired in that way are immediately cancelled, and the Government effects a saving of the interest on the debt so wiped out. existing law, in order to preserve the compound interest basis of the sinking fund, in effect, an amount of 5 per cent, per annum is paid into the sinking fund Minister in respect of debt so wiped out. Under that arrangement the debt is wiped out in 30 years and 50 years respectively. These provisions are contained in section 9AA of the principal act. The bill in drafting the original is designed to correct an anomaly in the provision which relates to the 5 per cent, contribution. The gross contributions to the fund The machinery proinclude the 30s. per cent, and 10s. per cent, respectively in respect of all live debt. Other contributions consist of capital repayments of other debt, such as, in particular, the war service homes debt. The 1930 act was drawn to allow of the .deduction of these capital repayments from the gross annual sinking fund receipts. It is on the difference between those two that the 5 per cent, compound interest is paid each year into the sinking fund. Section 9AA / of the act contains a fault. It readsThe amount of Fivo pounds per centum on the total amount received by the fund on and after the first day of July One thousand nine hundrod and thirty and up to the thirtieth day of June next preceding that financial year in which payment is being made in accordance with this section less amounts paid into the fund in that financial year . . . The principal alteration that this bill seeks to effect is to replace the words "" in that financial year "" with the words, "" during that period"", because, under that provision, as honourable members will see, the fund at any one point of time would be credited with 5 per cent. of the gross receipts after deducting the repayments of capital debt in any one year. In other words, the act as drawn limits deductions in any one financial year, to the repayments in that year. Under a strict interpretation of the law, we should now be paying into the sinking fund a greater amount than Parliament clearly intended should be contributed in any ono financial year. The repayments of which I speak are cumulative. Strictly, we should deduct only the repayments made in any one financial year. Under the Clearly, however, we should be able to deduct all the repayments since the law was amended in 1930.",30,Casey

Deducting the repayments during that period-£1,556,715-the total becomes £8,574,S02. Were the law strictly interpreted, we could deduct only the repayments made in the financial year with which we were dealing. That would be considerably less than the sum which the law clearly intends that we should deduct. I may say that tbe law has been implemented by the National Debt Sinking Fund Commission in the way clearly intended by Parliament. of the bill is to legalize its actions since 1930, and to put the matter right for the future. The Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Casey) says that the purpose of the sinking fund is to wipe out the postal de'bt in 30 years and all other debts in 50 years. I ask the honourable gentleman if he seriously believes that the sinking fund will wipe out those debts. The Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page), when Treasurer iu the Bruce-Page Government, claimed to have invented the sinking fund, which, he said, would do great things; but history tells us that Pitt started a sinking fund to wipe out the debts incurred in connection with the Napoleonic wars, and that, although in a few years between £10,000,000 and £15,000,000 had been wiped off those debts, in the same period £150,000,000 had been added to the national debt. It is claimed by some persons that between £28,000,000 and £30,000,000 of Australia's war debt, bearing interest at 4^ per cent., has been wiped off; hut it is not always pointed out that during the same period our national £98,000,000 at varying rates of interest up to 6 per cent. I am not greatly concerned about any proposals which are introduced to deal with the national debt, because that debt can never bo wiped out. It is not intended that it should be. The Auditor-General shows the utter impossibility of wiping out the national debt, for in his report for the year ended the 30th June, 1933, he pointed out that the total volume of taxation for the States; and the Commonwealth was £82,000,000,. and that interest and sinking fund charges represented £63,000,000. The task of wiping out, by means of a sinking f und,. a national debt so great as that, is as hopeless as that of a dog trying to eat itself up. It is simply begging th« question, to say that we can wipe out the nationaldebt by means of a sinking fund. Instead of hypnotising ourselvesinto the belief that the impossible can be achieved, let us face the facts honestly; in which case we shall realize that, without a complete remodelling of the financial system,, sinking funds are useless. The object member is going beyond the scope of thisamending bill. fore us proposes to amend legislation designed to wipe out the postal debt in 30* years and all other debts in 50 years. wealth debts. ing to show that the sinking fund proposed is totally inadequate for the purpose, but if that would be out of order,.

The bill before us proposes to dosomething which, in my opinion, is impossible. Notwithstanding the claim of the Assistant Treasurer that the sinking, fund has cancelled some of our debts, the fact remains that the national debt is= increasing. I should be glad to believe that this .bill will do what is claimed for it by the Assistant Treasurer, but I cannot believe that it will. On the contrary I am firmly convinced that, under thedebt has increased by present system offinance,'no sinking fund will ever wipe off the national debt. Question resolved in the affirmative.

Bill-by leave-rea d a third time. -for the Interior) [2.50] I move That the bill be now read a second time. ""The object of this bill is to give effect to Articles S, 9 and 10 of the Convention on certain questions relating to the con'flict of nationality laws, which was concluded at The Hague in 1930. Those articles read as follows:Article8 -If the national law of tlie wife her husband's nationality unless she -causes her to lose her nationality on marriage with a foreigner, this consequence shall be -conditional on her acquiring the nationality of the United States. As she lost her British the husband. Article9 -If the 7iational law of the wife causes her to lose her nationality upon a -change in the nationality of her husband occurring during marriage, this consequence shall be conditional on her acquiring her husthrough marrying American citizens. Tiand's new nationality. Article 10 -Nationalizatio n of the husband during marriage shall not involve a change in the nationality of the wife except with her consent. Everyone must agree that it is very -desirable that steps should be taken to remove the serious difficulty which arises when a British woman -becomes stateless by reason of her marriage. The Commonwealth nationality law is based on the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914. All the self-governing British dominions have adopted Part II . of that act with a view to the carrying out of a uniform system of naturalization throughout the Empire, and the defining of who are British subjects. It is obviously desirable that such uniformity should be maintained. The general principle which underlies the British law is that the wife of a British subject shall be deemed to be a British subject, and the wife of an alien shall be deemed to be au alien. The Commonwealth law, however, in common with the general British law, already provides that where a man, during the continuance of his marriage, ceases to be a British subject, by becoming naturalized in a foreign State, his wife may retain her British nationality by making a declaration that she desires to do so. It also provides that the Governor General may grant a certificate of naturalization to a British-born woman married to an alien who is the subject of a State which is at war with His Majesty. There is at present, however, no provision in the Commonwealth law by which a Britishborn woman, who becomes stateless on her marriage with an alien, may retain or regain her British nationality whilst her husband is still living, except under the special circumstances just mentioned. The foreign law which has affected British women to the greatest extent in rendering them stateless on marriage, is that of the United States of America. Since 1922, a woman who marries an American citizen does not thereby acquire becomes naturalized on her own account after at least twelve months' residence in nationality by reason of her marriage, this meant that she had no nationality. Thousands of British woman, including many Australians, have become stateless The position was regarded so seriously by Canada, which was naturally the British dominion most affected, that it lost no time in passing legislation to give effect to the Hague Convention. The Canadian bill became law in 1931. The British Parliament passed the necessary amending aet last year, and New Zealand is now following suit. It is very desirable that the Commonwealth should lose no further time in fulfilling its obligations and doing its part to restore uniformity in the nationality laws throughout the Empire. Anomalous situations are arising on account of the lack of uniformity. Eor example, wives of American citizens are arriving in Australia from time to time in possession of British passports in which they are described as British",32,Second Beading

An Australian-born wife of an American citizen would be entitled abroad to claim the rights of a British subject, but in this country she must still be regarded as an alien. This anomaly should he remedied as soon as possible. Strong representations have been made by women's organizations in Australia and elsewhere that the Hague Convention should not be ratified until it has been revised to embody the principle of the equality of the sexes. These submissions have received the careful and sympathetic consideration of the Government from time to time, with the result that before the matter came up for reconsideration at the League of Nations Assembly in 1932, the British Government and the League of Nations were advised in the following terms:Australian Government is prepared to accept principle tliat a woman on marriage shall not lose her nationality or acquire new nationality without her consent and to amend nationality law accordingly, provided His Majesty's Governments in United Kingdom and British self governing dominions are agreeable to take similar action so that uniformity of nationality posed new sub-section 4 also applies laws throughout the Empire may be preserved, euch uniformity being of importance in the interests of the system of Imperial naturalization now in force The Government still subscribes to the views expressed in that message, and the Prime Minister will raise the matter at the Imperial conference next year. Requests have been received during the last year that the Commonwealth Parliament should take a lead in passing legislation embodying the wider principle, and the subject has been given very earnest consideration by the Government, but it has been strongly felt that nationality, insofar as British subjects are concerned, is a matter which should be dealt with on an Empire basis, and that any attempt on the part of the Commonwealth to get out of step with the rest of the Empire would only lead to confusion. It may, however, be emphatically stated that this bill is not an alternative to the demands made by the women's organizations, but is designed to remove a real hardship experienced by many women, and to go so far as we can go in step with Great Britain and Canada. It does not close the door to to go through the whole process of further consideration of the principle of naturalization?

The bill provides for the substitution of a new section for section IS of the principal act. The proposed new subsection 1 repeats the existing provision that the wife of a British subject shall be deemed to be a British subject and the wife of an alien shall be deemed to be an alien. Proposed new sub-sections 4 and 6 re-enact the existing exceptions to the general principle, and proposed new sub-sections 2, 3 and 5 add new exceptions. Proposed new sub-section 2 deals with a British woman who marries a foreigner but does not thereby acquire his nationality. It provides that whether she was married before or after the enactment of this provision she shall retain her British nationality. Proposed new sub-section 3 makes a similar provision for a. British woman, who, having married a British subject, is liable to become stateless when her husband has become naturalized in some other country. Proto a British woman whose husband changes his nationality after marriage; but as a result of the provisions of proposed new sub-section 3, this provision will in future apply only in cases where, under the law of the foreign country, the woman acquires her husband's new nationality. Pjroposed new sub-section 5 is intended to give effect to article 10 of the convention, which provides that naturalization of the husband during marriage shall not involve a change in the nationality of the wife except with her consent. Proposed new sub-sections 3 and 4 deal with this provision insofar as British women are concerned, hut proposed new sub-section 5 applies to an alien woman whose husband acquires British nationality by the grant to him of a certificate of naturalization.

In addition, certain lands outside the Territory, which had been acquired under the Lands Acquisition Act, were transferred by the Commonwealth to the commission. In 1930 the commission ceased to exist, and by section 7 of the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1930 .all lands which were vested in the commission became vested in the Commonwealth. So far as lands in the Territory were concerned, they could then be disposed of by lease or otherwise in accordance with laws of the Territory. ""With respect to such lands which are outside the Territory, there was not, however, any provision for leasing or otherwise disposing of them. Section 63 of the Lands Acquisition Act provides that lands which are acquired or deemed to be acquired under that act may be disposed of if not required for Commonwealth purposes. There is no reason why the lands to which the bill relates should not be subject to disposal in the same manner as lands acquired under the Lands Acquisition Act. All such lands, in fact, were acquired under that act, but by reason of the Seat of Government (Administration) Acts 1924-1929 and .1930, characteristic. The object of this bill is, therefore, to bring these lands once more under the provisions of section 63 of the LandsAcquisition Act. adjourned. (No. 2) 1934. surer) [3.4] I move That the bill be now read a second time. The Royal Commission on the Wheat, Flour and Bread Industries has presented its first report and a supplementary report, and these have been laid on the table of the House. As was stated by the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page), in his second-reading speech on the Wheat Growers Relief Bill (No. 2) 1934, the commission has drawn attention to the serious financial position of wheat-growers, and has recommended that the Commonwealth Government shall provide assistance to the amount of £4,000,000 for distribution to wheat growers who have sown wheat for grain during 1934, this assistance to be provided partly by an excise duty or sales tax on flour and partly from other Commonwealth moneys. This measure is to give effect to the royal commission's recommendation regarding the imposition of a tax on flour, and it provides the machinery for collecting the tax on imported and Australian-made flour, and on flour used in the manufacture of imported goods, such as biscuits, macaroni, &c. The bill is practically the same as the previous flour tax act which operated from the 4th December. 1933, to the 31st May last, with certain minor alterations, which experience of the previous act has shown, to be desirable. The tax will be imposed by three separate taxing acts, which will be submitted later to Parliament, and will provide for a rate of £2 12s. 6d. a short",34,Nationalitybill 1934 Second Reading

190,Mr Casey (Corio,"Assistant Treaton of 2,000 lb. of flour. Provision has been made in this act for the tax to be imposed for a period of twelve months only, commencing on Monday, the 7th January, 1935. described, firstly, as an excise duty payable by millers on all sales by them on or after the 7th January, 1935, on all deliveries by them on or after that date in fulfilment of earlier contracts, and on all flour used by them on or after that date in the manufacture of goods; secondly, as a tax on all flour in excess of one-half ton, or 1,000 lb., held at the commencement of the tax by a person other than a miller; and thirdly, as a duty of customs on all flour imported into Australia, and on the quantity of flour used in the manufacture of goods imported, on or after the 7th January, 1935, Flour, which is in transit to any person on the 7th January, 1935, will be treated as part of his stocks at that date. Tax will be payable on flour produced by millers from wheat supplied by farmers for gristing. In view of the policy of taxing stocks on hand in excess of 1,000 lb. at the commencement of the tax the bill provides for a refund of tax paid on stocks in excess of 1,000 lb. on hand at the termination of the tax. The tax will thus apply to all flour used during the operation of the tax. When tax on stocks at the commencement of the tax has been accounted for, the only taxpayers thereafter, so far as Australian flour is concerned, will be the millers. Flour is defined as including any substance produced by processing wheat, and includes bran, pollard, sharps, semolina and self-raising flour. Although the bill is designed to imor, if passed on, has been refunded topose tax on all flour which goes into the purchaser concerned. final consumption in Australia during the operation of the tajc, provision is on to the consumer. A miller who is made for exemption in certain cases to liable to pay tax on flour sold by himprevent competitive anomalies between must show it as a separate item on his goods manufactured from wheat products invoice. Penalties are provided for any and goods manufactured from other attempt to pass on amounts in excess of cereals or substances. Thus, tax is not the actual tax payable.

(3) Flour for use in the manufacture of cornflour; and (4) Flour for use in the manufacture of goods, including meat proThe tax may be ducts, such as are popularly known as sausage binder, but not including other foods. Exemption from tax is provided for flour held by or sold to any person in. the Northern Territory for consumption in that territory. It is considered inequitable that tax should be imposed on such flour, as little or no wheat is grown in that territory and therefore nobenefit from the tax can accrue to any residentthere. Moreover, the present price of flour, delivered to outback stations in that area is £35 to £40 per ton, as against £7 in Melbourne. Flour exported or held for export ' will beexempt, and rebate will be made of tax paid on flour exported or used in the manufacture of goods which are exported. Tax is not payable by a publiccharitable institution-whic h term is defined as meaning a public hospital, a public benevolent institution or a religious organization-o n stocks of flourheld by it at the commencement of the tax.

Such tax is payable as follows:""Where the tax does not exceed £5, at the -time of submission of the declaration of stocks; where the tax exceeds £5, by equal monthly instalments of £5 or 20 per cent, of the tax, whichever is the greater. The first payment of tax will be made on the 10th January, 1935, and subsequent instalments on the 21st day of each .month subsequent to January, 1935. Millers will lodge monthly returns hy the 21st day of the month following that in which the taxable sale or delivery was made, and pay tax at the time of lodgement. Severe penalties are provided for evasion of tax by failure to furnish returns, or by furnishing false returns. The Commissioner of Taxation is arranging to follow up declarations and returns to test their accuracy, and will not hesitate to prosecute defaulters or evaders. While it is not anticipated that the serhands of the State. vices of the Income Tax Board of Review will be necessary to settle disputes hetween taxpayers and the Commissioner of Taxation, the bill provides for such «. means of settlement The bill contains secrecy clauses similar to those contained in the Sales Tax Assessment Acts. The machinery employed for the collection of sales tax has 1>een adopted, as far as possible, for purposes of the flour tax. This has been -done by reference to the sales tax acts, the necessary alterations being made in the wording wherever required. The bill is commended to honourable members. adjourned. TION OF RUSSIAN SOVIET OFFICIAL. posedTliat tlie Housa do now adjourn. A. few days ago I drew the attention of the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) to the fact that a paragraph had appeared in the newspapers stating that a report had been received from Prague to the effect that Australia was being asked further to reduce its exports of wheat. The Minister stated in reply that there was no truth whatever in the report. However, the Melbourne Age of yesterday reported that, at the Premiers Conference, it was stated that Australia was asked to reduce its exports of wheat by 30,000,000 bushels a year. I should like the Minister to give an explanation regarding the matter. -Owing to the shortness of the time at our disposal, I did not have an opportunity the other day to address myself to the motion moved by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), the purpose of which was to take the manufacture of armaments out of the hands of private individuals and place it in the I endorse every word spoken by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) regarding maternity welfare work in Russia.

She went to Russia, and for some years worked in the hospitals in that country. In her book she says that, in regard to the treatment of women and children, Russia leads the world.

200,Dr. Maloney,"It is. I feel sureshould be ashamed. If a Mexican president favoured anEnglish oil combine the American .authorities immediately transported guns over the border and brought the country into a state of revolution. What do these unscrupulous commercial combines care if hundreds of people are blown to pieces as the result of a revolution fomented by them? nated, he was succeeded by Huerta; that was regarded as an accident. Huerta, in turn, was followed by that vile scoundrel Villa. Immediately after the assassination of Madero the British oil companies supplied the money to be expended in bringing about a state of revolt. When Huerta disappeared, Garranza, who became the President of Mexico, favoured the American interests, and all was well so long as he protected the interests of the combine. Later, Garranza was sufficiently patriotic to realize that his country was being robbed, and immediately showed his opposition to the big American oil combines. That happened during the war, and his position became so uncomfortable that he informed them that, if they went any further, he would declare war against the United States of America. Neither the British nor the American oil concerns wished that to occur because they thought that Mexico would be allied with Germany. After the signing of the Armistice, British and American oil interests combined, and Carranza, following a revolution supported by foreign money and arms, disappeared. The whole history of oil and the international complications associated with its production and sale have nearly brought America and Britain to war. It is useless to tell the lie that it is impossible for England and America to go to war. The danger which still exists is due entirely to the cursed power of the oil interests. The American oil king, Rockefeller, is reputed to have made £200,000,000 out of the people, and as a result of his activities in the oil business hope that whenever another royal comhas forced other companies out of operation, and brought wholesale distress and misery upon the people. There is also another Napoleon in the person of Sir Henri Deterding, who possesses extensive powers as director-general of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company. is the history of the oil industry in Persia? Lord Hardinge states that by the bribing of Persian officers oilbearing lands have been secured. From what I have read, I understand that £100,000 was paid to obtain valuable oil concessions from the Persian Government, but that the Government of that country was so badly When Madero was assassitreated and charged so much for the oil produced that the Shah, being a despot, and, in his own country, above all laws, ultimately sought the advice of the wise men whom he is entitled to call, and with their assistance rescinded all the agreements entered into. Sir John Cadman, who visited Australia solely to secure control of our oil interests, and who has also visited Persia to regain the concessions, after a great deal of difficulty paid £1,000,000 in cash for Persian oil interests, and that payment is to be followed by another ""£1,000,000 next year. Ultimately, -a concession was granted on the payment of £1,000,000 annually for a lease of 60 years. We do not want those directing the operations of oil combines in other countries to assume control in Australia. As we have valuable oil deposits at Roma, in Queensland, and at Lakes Entrance, in Victoria, we should assist the Commonwealth or the Slate governments to control the production of oil in Australia, and so stand up against these great combines operating in America and in England. The States should be the only producers and sellers of fuel oil. Let us say that our Government shall be the only seller. What should be the cost to the private individual? This should be the retail cost in the country of origin, plus freighta mere bagatelle per gallon-plu s landingcharges and customs duty in Australia, and a fair profit for the distributor. Only in that way can we control the price of oil. Money is no object to the big oil combines, and they will not stop at bribery. [Leave to continue given.""] I mission is appointed to inquire into the subject of petrol prices, the House will see that the best legal assistance is obtained to protect the interests of Australia and of witnesses who may be called upon to give evidence before the commisWhat sion, so that they may not be browbeaten at the inquiry. Mr Pollock, who gave evidence at the recent inquiry into petrol, and who, I believe, is an expert on oil, stated definitelyAustralia's losses by overcharges and all the subterfuges called refining, as well as imports of petrol as power kerosene, may be shown to approximate £250,000,000 since 1921 . . . From June, 1921, to December, 1932, over 2,800,000,000 gallons of oil were imported to this country from the United States of America, Persia, and Netherlands East IndiesThe retail price in Australia for that quantity The retail price in America 106,000,000 The duty and excise paid in Australia The State petrol taxes in America These figures show that Australians paid £200,000,000 more than Americans for the same quantity of oil.
