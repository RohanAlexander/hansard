241,The Speaker,"Order! It being 8 pm,Wednesday, 12 September 2007 ----National Dementia Awareness Month Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (11.30 am)-Next Monday marks the beginning of National Dementia Awareness Month, which runs from 17 September to 17 October. The theme for this year is ‘No time to lose’. Currently there are more than a thousand new cases of dementia in Australia presenting every week. The total number of Australians now living with dementia is 220,000. By 2050 this figure is anticipated to escalate to 730,000, so there really is ‘no time to lose’. Canadian Professor Ken Rockwood, a world-leading dementia researcher, clinician and author, will be this year’s keynote speaker at Dementia Awareness Month events. Professor Rockwood pioneered the person centred model in the care and treatment of people with dementia. Art and dementia is a particular focus of his work and he has established artist-inresidence programs in dementia units with great success. I am delighted that Professor Rockwood will be addressing the launch of Dementia Awareness Month in my electorate of Newcastle next Monday and I look forward to co-hosting, with Senator Marise Payne, his visit to Parliament House next Tuesday when he addresses Parliamentary Friends of Dementia. I encourage all members and senators to attend his presentation. For people living with dementia, for their families and carers and for those at risk the theme ‘No time to lose’ is a call for urgent action by government and communities everywhere to improve the quality of life for people with dementia, to increase funding for research and to engage in a brain-healthy lifestyle to reduce the risk of dementia in later years. Excellent work is being carried out across Australia. Alzheimer’s Australia’s Mind Your Mind risk reduction program and the development of the Kimberley Indigenous Cognitive Assessment Tool are just two examples. Importantly, the Kimberley Indigenous Cognitive Assessment Tool has enabled researchers to identify the prevalence of dementia amongst Indigenous people and the result is, of course, that it is significantly high. I want to draw the attention of the House to the work of the Hunter Network of Alzheimer’s Australia NSW. In partnership with the local Rotary Group District 9670, the Hunter network raised more than $260,000 towards the establishment of a dementia resource centre in Newcastle. Alzheimer’s Australia NSW matched those funds, giving a total of $550,000 to purchase a residential property. That has been done, but now it is time to refurbish and fit out that property as a dementia resource centre, which is estimated to cost a total of $630,000. The New South Wales government has committed $150,000 towards the cost and the Newcastle Permanent Charitable Foundation has provided another $60,000, but Commonwealth assistance is now needed to complete the project. I call on the government to match the efforts made by the community to enable the development of the Hunter dementia resource centre to be completed. The need is great. There really is ‘No time to lose’. (Time expired) Josiah Sherwood am)-TodayI want to pay tribute to a very special young boy, his family and the local comMAIN COMMITTEE",174,Notices

243,Mr Anthony Smith (Casey,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11.33munity in Casey. Josiah Sherwood is an eight-year-old boy who was born with a very rare condition called moebius syndrome, which affects the nerves and muscles on one side of his face, meaning he has trouble swallowing, his right eye does not blink and he has difficulty shutting it. He has been through a terrible ordeal with all of this. Some time ago he had the first of two operations to correct this rare condition in Australia. The second operation must take place in Canada and obviously is a very expensive endeavour. But it is a great community story from Mount Evelyn, in the Casey federal electorate, where the community and his family and friends have worked tirelessly to raise funds so he is able to go to Canada for this very rare operation. I was privileged to play just a very small part in raising some of that money by getting local people, some people in this building, to sponsor me on how far I could kick a footballand we were able to raise a small amount of money. It was great to be part of their journey and I am grateful for all of those who lent their financial support. I am particularly grateful to all of them who topped up their contributions when I could not kick as far as I thought I could. I make mention of this today because this Sunday Josiah leaves for Canada with his family. He will be there for some months to have this complicated operation. When he returns he will have a normal smile, which is what he and his family have wanted since the day he was born. I want to pay tribute to them for their determination and their sunny outlook right through what has been a very difficult situation, and to all of their generous friends throughout the outer east of Melbourne who have assisted them, including Josiah’s school, Mount Evelyn Christian School, which has made all of its fundraising efforts in recent years go towards Josiah’s appeal. I pay tribute to the principal, Martin Hanscamp, for his leadership, and to all of the schoolteachers and parents. Dining with the Stars Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (11.36 am)-I take the opportunity today to commend the staff and students of the Illawarra Institute of TAFE for the extraordinary effort that went into a fabulous evening, Dining with the Stars. The students at the college worked with a celebrity group of chefs to prepare an amazing dinner at the college facility. The major celebrity chef was Glen Flood, who originally trained at Wollongong, was awarded Apprentice of the Year in New South Wales and, after some international experience, joined the team in Melbourne at Australia’s first Fifteen Restaurant and the Fifteen Foundation. We know that this venture was originally set up by Jamie Oliver in the UK to train underprivileged young people as chefs. The night also featured local talented chefs: Glen Gatland from Zach’s Cafe at City Diggers; Michael Ciot from Michael’s Trattoria; and Chedo Bezbradica of Chedo’s. The teaching staff at the college are to be warmly commended for helping the students of SynerG 2007 in hosting this special local event. As the students said: We have organised this spectacular event to further our experience in the hospitality industry and learned first hand what is involved in such an event. Our goal is to improve the personal confidence, interpersonal skills and employment opportunities through developing skills and knowledge in the hospitality industry. We have recognised the barriers to achieve our goal and we will deal with them in a professional and timely manner. Tonight is an opportunity for many of us to successfully plan and operate an event to this extent. SynerG has an opportunity to experience the hospitality industry first hand in our learning environment. The apprentice chefs have a chance of a lifetime to work with three great MAIN COMMITTEE local chefs and one interstate extraordinaire. Our guests tonight have the opportunity to experience an entertaining and informative event, all the while supporting our education and experiences. As the local federal member, it was certainly a privilege to be part of this fantastic event and see the wonderful outcomes in our public TAFE system and the way that public TAFE system is working in close cooperation with local industry bodies. Equine Influenza has crippled the equine industry in the Hawkesbury. Equine influenza is a highly contagious viral disease and, as a result, the entire Hawkesbury region has been quarantined. Last FridayI attended a meeting at the Hawkesbury Racecourse where I was able to speak with horse owners, staff and people who have equine related businesses. I heard first hand about the challenges they were facing. One family’s entire income was dependent on their horse transportation business. I welcome the Australian government’s announcement on Sunday of $110 million to assist the equine industry. This assistance will help many people in the Hawkesbury. I would like to acknowledge the Howard government in recognising the needs of the people in the equine industry and responding accordingly. It is only because of strong economic management by the Howard government that funding such as this can be made. With the Howard government, that assistance is able to be made with a quick response. Many people have asked why the horse industry needs assistance. There is a misconception that the equine influenza outbreak affects only horse owners, who may be wealthy. This is not the case. This disease affects more than just owners; it has a knock-on effect impacting people including trainers, jockeys, farriers, stablehands, transport companies and vets, to name a few. The $110 million is in addition to the $4 million announced last week by the Australian government. The $4 million provided by the Australian government is being distributed to people who register with Racing NSW and other state authorities and provides them with up to $1,500 emergency assistance for essential bills. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. Peter McGauran, acknowledged this was not enough and worked together to create a package that would provide assistance for people from all facets of the industry. The result was this $110 million assistance package. For people who no longer have a wage, there will be a wage supplement payment available, which is the equivalent of Newstart allowance and which will be backdated to 25 August. For businesses that derive the majority of their income from the commercial horse industry, there will be business assistance grants of up to $5,000 provided. There is a commercial horse assistance payment, which will be paid to the carers of horses that normally compete but who, because of quarantine restrictions, have not been able to generate an income. It is estimated that the carers of up to 10,000 horses will be eligible for this assistance alone in New South Wales, the ACT and Queensland. Up to $10 from the commercial horse assistance payment will be retained by Racing NSW and used for limited purposes, including public liability. This also includes grants of up to $200,000 for non-government and not-for-profit equestrian organisations that have incurred expenses directly related to the outbreak.

244,Mrs Markus (Greenway) (11.38 Am),I rise today to speak about an epidemic which,177,Statements By Members
245,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (11.41 Am),"In the context of economic and political relaforgotten. The persistent persecution of the mainstream Catholic Church as opposed to the Communist controlled Catholic community in China is contrary to both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which China is a party, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which holds amongst other things that everyone is entitled to freedoms contained in the declaration regardless of their religion. Importantly, the declaration specifically provides for freedom from persecution or torture on the basis of religion. The reason I make reference to Catholics specifically, bearing in mind the broad based persecution of Christians and other Chinese whose only crime is to want to practise their religion free from interference of the state, is that I follow very closely the plight of one persecuted man of God, Bishop Su Zhimin, the hidden bishop of Baoding. According to some observers, the bishop has spent over 30 years in jail. He has frequently been arrested, imprisoned and released on short shrift only to be detained once more. In a letter from the Papal Nuncio to me, after I raised this issue with him, he says: The competent authorities in the Holy See have confirmed that sadly the Most Reverend James Su Zhimin, the Clandestine Bishop of Baoding, has been under detention since October 1997. Since then there has been no information regarding his fate. The Holy See on many occasions has protested against his detention and continues to do all it can to ensure more religious freedom for the Catholic community in China. The Catholic Church in China exists as a clandestine organisation, with the Chinese government considering loyalty to the Pope to be a threat to its national security. Authentic Catholicism is thus effectively illegal, with the requirement that Catholics practise within the framework of the Orwellian, state sanctioned Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. This is fundamentally in opposition to Catholicism, which recognises the authority of the Holy See. I have followed this issue closely-along with the issue of a number of other Catholics who have been listed by the Cardinal Kung Foundation-working closely with the Wall Street Journal Asia, the Apostolic Nuncio and His Eminence Cardinal Pell to raise the issue of the hidden bishop and his compatriots in this country and beyond. I have raised the bishop’s case with the foreign minister in question No. 5493. Typically, in our so-called human rights dialogue, the issue of the most senior and most long standing prisoner of conscience from the most major religion, Catholicism, in China has not been raised. Australia has not raised it, despite this man’s standing. It is quite unfashionable in this place to raise issues of human rights, but outside China in the Western imagination human rights remains a very strong issue. China will need to release people like the bishop to get any credit in human rights before the Olympics. (Time expired) Dobell Electorate: Services the New South Wales government to privatise the state’s energy sector. I have been working closely with local residents lobbying Energy Australia to have high-voltage powerlines in Wamberal placed underground. The local community have already had one win, with Energy Australia agreeing to place some of the powerlines underground in residential areas. I am continuing to work with local residents to extend the underground powerline by 800 metres to include the northern section of Wamberal, where Wamberal Public School is located and a new preschool is under construction.

246,Mr Ticehurst (Dobell) (11.45 Am),"I rise today to express my concern over plans byhave worked hard lobbying for these underground powerlines. They have told us that they organised letterbox drops, rallies and so on, so as to make their voices heard by the state government. If the New South Wales Labor government were to privatise this sector, all of the Wamberal residents’ hard work could be wasted. The sale of Energy Australia would mean a private company would take over the Wamberal powerlines and the company would have the authority to reconsider and, indeed, reverse the underground placement of these powerlines. As the local federal member, it is my job to represent the concerns of local residents and to run a ruler over projects that have the potential to affect the lifestyle that we enjoy on the Central Coast. I therefore call on Energy Australia and the New South Wales government to make a real commitment to the residents of Wamberal to ensure their voices are heard and their best interests are realised-now, and also in the event of privatisation. After 12 years of neglecting New South Wales and mismanaging the state economy, privatisation of government sectors such as the energy sector is the only way, at present, that state Labor can raise more money to try and fix our ailing state-unless, of course, we have all Labor federal, state and territory governments. In that case, we could expect that the GST would be raised to bail out these inefficient and wasteful governments. The sale of the energy sector alone is expected to raise up to $20 billion, which state Labor is likely to squander yet again, leaving local residents without the much needed local infrastructure. This year, the federal government has fully funded two significant projects on the Central Coast, which fall under the state government’s jurisdiction. The federal funding of $80.3 million I have secured for the Mardi to Mangrove Creek Dam pipeline will future-proof the Central Coast’s water supply, even though water supply is a state government responsibility. Tuggerah Lakes on the Central Coast is another responsibility that state Labor has neglected. The federal government has been able to provide $20 million to secure funding to restore this jewel in the crown. I say to the state government: do not let the privatisation of Energy Australia ruin what local residents have fought hard for. We need to have these high-voltage powerlines placed underground. Ansett Australia anniversary of Ansett being put under external administration. There is no question that the collapse of Ansett had a huge impact on Australia, with 15,000 staff losing their jobs, and an estimated 60,000 people in associated industries being affected, over 200 of whom lived in the federal seat of Hindmarsh. For these former Ansett employees it has been six long and generally disappointing years since Ansett’s collapse. These years have consisted of times of hope and despair as the prospect of receiving entitlements has slowly diminished. As of April this year, hundreds of exAnsett employees were still waiting on $93 million worth of full entitlements. Some exemployees are waiting on tens of thousands of dollars of their own money. The primary victims of the company’s collapse are the long standing and loyal employees of Ansettindividuals who devoted decades of their lives to the airline. They are some of the most deserving of their entitlements. MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Statements By Members
247,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (11.47 Am),"Today, 12 September 2007, marks the sixthThese have been six years in which the government said they were doing the right thing by the workers yet subsequently diverted some $60 million out of the greater post-collapse Ansett assets and ticket tax away from the ex-employees. Many Ansett workers blame the federal government for the airline’s collapse. It is understandable that they are furious that some of the funds raised from the $10 ticket levy paid by passengers are being spent on airport security, while former staff are still waiting to recoup their entitlements. In a well-received announcement concerning the air passenger ticket levy on 28 September 2001, the then Deputy Prime Minister and minister for transport stated: The Government has imposed the levy to pay for the entitlements of Ansett employees. This was reported in a number of dailies, including the Sydney Morning Herald, which read: ‘The levy ... was imposed to guarantee the entitlements of Ansett workers ...’ Nowhere did it say that the levy was to go towards paying regional upgrades of security at airports. I do not think anyone could seriously begrudge the ex-employees receiving the assistance from the federal government in the form that it was made at the time, but it is unfortunate that, in the event of the levy raising more than what was owed to the government in repayment of the $330 million advance, any surplus was to have no connection with the plight of their exAnsett workers or their access to their entitlements. Instead of the Ansett ticket tax being used to guarantee the entitlements of ex-employees, as stated very clearly by the then minister, the government decided to spirit away surplus amounts for use in regional electorates. At a later date the then minister said in November 2002, perhaps to clarify: They were never to see all of the ticket tax. It was used to fund, if you like, an overdraft facility. Six years after the collapse, six years after the government instituted the Ansett ticket tax, people are still waiting for their entitlements. (Time expired) Personal Explanation lian Federal Police visited my electorate office to seek my assistance to deal with some allegations made, particularly against a colleague of ours, in relation to the use of members’ entitlements. As the House would know, I have been cleared of any wrongdoing. This is an opportunity to reflect on what has happened over the last six months. I have respected the process and cooperated fully with the Australian Federal Police. I am very grateful to the many people in the electorate of Moreton who have made it quite plain to me that they did not believe the nonsense they were reading in the media. Of course, I am pleased that their faith in me has been justified by the announcement that there is no problem with anything I have done. Media commentary wrongly associated me with allegations regarding printing entitlement use. There has been no investigation of any use by me of my entitlements; rather, the matter the Australian Federal Police were inquiring into centred on the allegation of a phantom staffer created by a colleague who had worked in my office. I say quite plainly that I did allow a person to work in my office for several days as part of a training program to assist that person to gain skills. There is nothing wrong with that and the Australian Federal Police agree that there is nothing wrong with that. They met this so-called ‘phantom staffer’ 27 weeks ago. The extraordinary thing to most fair-minded people is that 27 weeks ago they should have cleared me of any wrongdoing, knowing that the allegation of a phantom staffer was simply wrong.

Sharon Cowden is married to Paul Lucas, who is the new Deputy Premier of Queensland. This was reported in the Courier-Mail on 9 March, so there is nothing new in that allegation. That was the last gasp of anything brave from the Courier-Mail, which continued to report breathlessly the things that Peter Beattie wanted to report. Peter Beattie and the Australian Labor Party machine in Queensland have been up to their eyeballs in this whole matter, briefing the media. A couple of questions need to be answered. How did Premier Peter Beattie get a copy of the warrant that was only ever shown to people like me on the day the AFP visited? Within days of the visit to my office, Premier Peter Beattie is flying the warrant around in the house of parliament. I am not sure how that was done. Why is it that the Courier-Mail went deftly quiet in their coverage of my reprieve? The Courier-Mail of course has been dominated by the Labor Party media machine. SoI have kept on with my job over the last six months but I believe it is important, as I work on things like Mains and Kessel’s roads, that the people know the truth about what happened to me this year. Macarthur Centre for Sustainable Living with my wife and family. It is an area of Sydney that we are very proud of. The south-west Sydney lifestyle is one of cultural diversity. Our love of sport may sometimes be a little more parochial than not, supporting the Wests Tigers, but we are very proud to live there and I am very proud to represent the interests of people who live in Western Sydney. Last Sunday, I attended the spring fair of the Macarthur Centre for Sustainable Living. Apart from all the benefits that, as I said, are attributed to those of us who live in Western Sydney, we also have a centre that is concerned about the preservation of not only our lifestyle but also our environment. This organisation is funded by the Sustainable Regions Program through the Macarthur Regional Organisations of Councils. The centre is very much at the forefront of displaying the schemes available and the tangible benefits through conservation practices that we can bring to our lives at home and to our environment in south-west Sydney. The spring fair was a remarkable event. It provided a unique opportunity to showcase not only the techniques but also the education underpinning them. It gave practical demonstrations of those things that we can all do within our environment to conserve water, such as the re-use of our grey water; to reduce our total reliance on electricity; and to reduce our level of waste through recycling and composting. Apart from being the centre’s prime event to showcase its activity, it was also a fair, which was well attended by people within my community. It was heart warming to see the extent to which people were taking an interest in the preservation of their environment. They were keen to look at what they can do to recycle, to save water and to avoid waste. They were looking sensibly at various power options, including a mix of renewable and sustainable electricity generation. This fair is a credit to the area and certainly a credit to the Macarthur Centre for Sustainable Living. MAIN COMMITTEE",180,Statements By Members
249,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (11.54 Am),"Over the past 30 years I have lived in my electorateRenewable Energy public about nuclear energy and the coalition’s position-its centrepiece being a cheap, pledge-signing stunt and misleading television advertising. It is politics of the worse kind. You do not achieve an informed public or offer any real policy positions running around with corflute pledges and felt pens. It is the old Beazley Telstra pledge rehashed, and it has about as much credibility. It is also plainly hypocritical, because the same party flip-flopped on its uranium mining policy at its recent conference. It is now prepared to allow more than three mines, and it says that it is okay for Australia to increase its uranium mining capacity. If you are running around trying to scare people about the dangers of nuclear power and stifling any real debate on the issue, why would you actively promote Australian uranium? If it were such a dangerous commodity, why would you be selling it around the rest of the world? Unlike Labor, I actually want to have a factual debate about nuclear power where the community can exercise its voice. I have never wavered in my stance on what I have said. Australia should not run headlong into nuclear power, but nor should we close off options that could benefit this nation in years to come. In controlling oil, the Arab and South American countries have done very well for their economic futures, and we should be doing something similar. We have 40 per cent of the world’s uranium, as has Canada, and we should be seen to be utilising that to this country’s advantage. The debate we need to have is: do 21 million people scattered around the coastline of Australia need nuclear power? Is it economical? Could it benefit the environment? Is it safe? Will the use of pebble bed technology in nuclear power generation make it appreciably safer? We need to look at all these things. Then we need to have that debate about whether or not we should enrich uranium in Australia-value-add to the product in this country-and sell it only to non-proliferating countries. Finally, if you are sincere in having this debate we must find where we are going to deposit our nuclear waste. I am not advocating nuclear power plants in my electorate. I am not advocating that we have a headlong rush into nuclear energy; I am saying that, as an intelligent country, we should be having the debate and positioning Australia for years to come, and not this pious hypocrisy that Labor has been going on with while it opens up more mines.

Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (12.00 pm)-The Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment (Child Disability Assistance) Bill 2007 introduces a new payment, child disability assistance, into social security law.

250,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (11.57 Am),The Labor Party is out to scare and misinform the,182,Families Community Services And Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment Child Disability Assistance Bill 2007
251,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley),"In accordance with standing order 193years of age. It is to be funded over the next four years. The first payment will be made in October this year and over the four years it is estimated that the cost will amount to over $560 million. Labor certainly supports this much needed additional payment, which will certainly help those caring for children who have a disability. In June 2006 the carer allowance was paid to 106,622 carers who were caring for over 125,000 children with disabilities. I think everybody in this House would know that carers of children with a disability are certainly under considerable financial pressure in their efforts to care for their children and to pay for essential supports. Medical expenses can greatly exceed those faced by the vast majority of children, whether it is for early intervention therapies, respite care, appropriate educational placements or physical aids, which can be very expensive. All of these things can place families in situations where the provision for their child is beyond their resources. Children with disabilities also have very, very diverse needs that can change over time. Young children with a disability can benefit from very early intervention and therapy to maximise their early childhood development and their learning. I am sure we are all in contact with families who would benefit from a break and they need the respite care to give them that break. As children develop they outgrow aids and equipment, which then need replacing. We can all think of home or vehicle modifications, such as a hoist in the home or aids to help travel in the family car. Many families with a child or children with a disability face these additional expenses as the children grow up. So this child disability assistance payment will help carers with the purchase of all of these different types of assistance. We understand that it really is going to be able to help families, who can then decide themselves about how best to spend this money. We certainly, as I said, welcome this $1,000 payment because we know that it will help carers who are under considerable financial stress. We are also aware that this payment forms part of a broader disability support package called the disability assistance package. This was announced in June and we understand that a considerable amount-almost $1 billion of that-will be provided to help older carers and their families. The government has said that it will translate into around 1,750 new supported accommodation places, 800 new respite places to be available by 2012 and additional inhome support and respite to assist older carers continue in their caring role. At a cost of over $700 million, carers of around 130,000 children will get the $1,000 payment that we are debating here today. We know how helpful that will be. There is over $20 million to enable respite, early intervention and other services for children in their local areas. Most importantly, as part of this package, there is also additional investment in employment services because many people with disabilities can and are able to work and want to be able to work, and if they are provided with assistance to do so then they can have very productive lives in the workforce. So there is $21 million for an extra 500 supported employment places in various business services, $30-odd million to continue targeted support to people with a disability who cannot benefit from supported employment, over $20 million in viability support to help those business services that are in temporary crisis and over $26 million to provide increased funding for other disability services. MAIN COMMITTEE I am sure the parliament is aware that disability services have, for some period of time now, been funded through the Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement-otherwise known as the CSTDA. This is still being renegotiated. This disability assistance package which was announced in June did include direct Commonwealth funding of disability services and all the other areas that I have just mentioned. The states and territories have requested detail about how the supported accommodation will be provided and who will provide ongoing funding. As I understand it, this information was promised at the end of July but is yet to be received by the states and territories. Just under half of the disability assistance package was in the form of income support payments to families caring for a child under 16. Of course, we do welcome this additional funding for people with disabilities and the extra money for their carers, but we are concerned that there is still no agreement on the fourth Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement. Up until Minister Brough announced the additional funding, he had said that he would match the states and territories fifty-fifty for unmet need for services. But then on 4 July, without any notice, the minister withdrew this offer and stated, ‘The offer is no longer available in light of the disability package announced the week prior.’ Families have to juggle both access and eligibility for a range of services including disability programs provided by the states and territories, through the Home and Community Care Program, the education system and Centrelink. What we are concerned about is that the way in which the government has gone about announcing this new disability assistance package may add to further complexity in what is, particularly for parents and carers, an already very, very complex environment. That said, we do welcome the additional funding but we would like to see the minister continue to negotiate with the states and territories to get an agreed Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement. We think that that will make it less complex for those carrying out their caring responsibilities and those who are delivering services to people with a disability. What we do not want is for people with disabilities or for their carers to be caught up in the blame game that we hear so often unfortunately from the Prime Minister and from Minister Brough. We think that a renegotiated agreement will in fact not only make it easier for carers and for people with disabilities to find their way around a complex system but also make sure that both the Commonwealth and the states and territories meet the needs of those with a disability and meet the needs of carers as well. We on this side of the House initiated the first Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement back in 1991. It is the case that at that time this agreement resulted in dramatically improved services for people with disabilities and for their families. So Labor continues our commitment to further improve services for people with disabilities. This was one of the reasons that we initiated the recent Senate inquiry into the funding and operation of the Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement which reported in February this year. Evidence to that inquiry from people right around the country-people with disabilities and their carers-was certainly consistent. What they constantly drew the attention of the Senate to were the problems with access to services, the inadequacy of support and the reliability and predictability of services. All of these issues were raised time and again, both in the hearings to the Senate inquiry and through various submissions. Unfortunately, many people expressed their frustration and anger when all they saw was govMAIN COMMITTEE ernments at the state and Commonwealth level blaming each other when service needs remain unmet. What we need in this area of disability policy is a whole-of-government response. That means the Commonwealth, the states and the territories working together to get a new Commonwealth State/Territory Disability Agreement to deliver the services and the support that people with a disability and their carers really need and deserve. That is what they need now. People also need to know that it will be delivered in a less complex way and over the longer term. That said, we are very pleased to support the legislation, because we know how needed the additional funding is, particularly for carers of children with a disability. port the Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment (Child Disability Assistance) Bill 2007. Families caring for children with a disability do so caringly and ungrudgingly. However, they often face a disproportionate financial burden due to the many extra costs for healthcare and support for their children. As minister for women, I also learned that the responsibility for caring for children with a disability disproportionately falls on women. Research into the cost of caring undertaken in a 2006 survey suggests that one-third of people providing primary care are living in households with incomes that place them in the poorest fifth of households in Australia. Who cares? The cost of caring in Australia 2002-2005, the AMP-NATSEM income and wealth report also found that carers are on average $5,600 worse off each year than people with no care responsibilities. That is a big additional burden to carry. Carers also pay a high price in terms of restricted job opportunities and reduced income. The labour force participation rate for primary carers, for example, is only 39 per cent, and it is obvious why this is so. There are a number of additional challenges that parents undertake in the care of a child or children with a disability. These can range from aids such as wheelchairs and hoists to child care and special education needs. Often, equipment to support children with a disability needs to be changed frequently, either due to the growth of a child or because the equipment has worn out. Parents with a child or children with a disability are often on duty 24 hours a day, and this payment could assist with respite care to give families a well-earned break from their caring role. I often meet parents during my regular rounds in the community of Pearce, and I get to hear of the problems first hand. For example, a woman who came to meet me recently had two children with autism, while another woman had two children with dyspraxia. Early intervention would benefit these children as this condition affects the child’s ability to speak-and speech therapy is not optional; it is absolutely essential. It is not unusual to find families managing two children with a disability. I am therefore pleased to support this bill today which introduces a new payment-child disability assistance-into social security law. Child disability assistance will be available to carers of disabled children under the age of 16, in respect of whom the carer receives carer allowance for the relevant period. A total of $721.2 million over five years will be provided by the government, with an annual payment of $1,000 to each family to assist them with the purchase of equipment and necessary support for their child. As I said, this could be used to help purchase a wheelchair, install a hoist, replace equipment, modify the home, modify the family car or provide respite care or therapy. The first payment of child disability assistance will be made MAIN COMMITTEE",182,Families Community Services And Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment Child Disability Assistance Bill 2007
252,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (12.12 Pm),"I am also very pleased to be able to be here to supnext month, October 2007, and payments in future years will be made in July. The payment will not be subject to income tax, nor will it count as income for social security or family assistance purposes. There are approximately 130,000 children with a disability. Most of these children need lifelong support, and this additional financial support will be very welcome by the approximately 106,000 families who qualify for the carer allowance caring for these children today. As at 1 July 2006, there were 2,529 carer allowance customers in the electorate of Pearce. These included current and suspended customers and those with health care cards. I know these parents will welcome the additional support they are entitled to under this amended legislation. We have improved the assistance to families as a government for those families caring for children with a disability since the introduction of the handicap child’s allowance in 1974. This was replaced with the carers allowance in cases where a child has a functional impairment. A carer can automatically receive the carers allowance in the case of certain disabilities, but other children have to be assessed to determine eligibility for their carer. Medical expenses, the tax rebate, the childcare Inclusion and Professional Support Program and, in certain cases, a carer adjustment payment all assist families to care for children with a disability. The childcare Inclusion and Professional Support Program help families to arrange affordable childcare services for children that have high support needs. This mostly assists families with children with, as I said, high support needs. The additional funding made available means that 3,000 extra children can benefit from the inclusion support subsidy. The carer adjustment payment is an interim payment of $10,000 to help families with a child aged from birth to six years old who has been diagnosed with a serious disability or a severe illness. It is available for a two-year period, allowing an initial adjustment period until a review of eligibility for a carer payment can be determined. Support for families who are caring for children with a disability is typical of those important safety nets that underpin our system of government, which encourages those who can care for their families to do so but recognises the particular challenges and at times the grave hardship for many families undertaking those caring roles. I fully support this amendment to legislation and I ask that the minister continues to regularly review the legislation with a view to ensuring that parents are always adequately supported in this role. The government funding of $721.2 million over five years to provide families already receiving carer allowance and an additional $1,000 annually, as I said, will be tax free, which I am sure will be welcome by all families. The research, interestingly enough, taken into the cost of caring undertaken in 2006 suggests that one-third of people providing primary care for the elderly and disabled, including disabled children, live in households whose income places them in the poorest fifth of households in Australia. This has always been of great concern to me because I do see perhaps the areas of greatest hardship in our communities in those families where people are caring for a family member with a disability, whether it be children, the elderly, the chronically ill or adults. We certainly know that there are a large number of ageing parents still caring for their children in their fifties. I have seen some very sad cases. SoI think it is important that we are constantly reviewing how we are managing this group of people in our community to ensure that they are always fully supported in their role of caring. With the assistance of the carers MAIN COMMITTEE allowance and the proposed child disability assistance, a great deal of pressure will certainly be taken off parents, and hopefully it will also allow them to improve their care for the children or child with a disability. I fully support these measures. munity Services and Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment (Child Disability Assistance) Bill 2007. I support much of what was said by the member for Pearce and others on this bill today. I have some issues with the bill. At some point in the course of my contribution, I would like to talk about the issue of the way in which the carer adjustment payment is applied-that is, the $10,000 one-off payment that is made to families where they have children under the age of six with a disability. There is an issue that I would like to go to with respect to that particular matter. Prior to doing that, I firstly say that we support the contribution that has been proposed to be paid to carers who have children with a disability. It is the view of Labor and, of course, the government that young children with disabilities can benefit from early intervention and therapy to maximise their early childhood development and learning. Indeed, we would say that some families and children would benefit from a break such as respite care. As they develop, older children outgrow aids and equipment, which will need to be replaced. Home or vehicle modifications, such as a hoist in the home or help to travel in the family car, are often necessary and, of course, very expensive. To that extent we would support the tax-free payment of $1,000 to carers. As I understand it, the government chose to make the payment. I assume that the fact that it is a one-off payment of $1,000 per year allows for outlays on potentially expensive equipment required. I guess the government has to consider whether, in fact, it has taken the right approach, but there is a concern that one-off payments are not used as well as a payment made on a monthly or fortnightly basis. Indeed, some of the benefits from the Commonwealth to people in the community are paid in instalments to ensure that such payments are not used for other purposes. So there is a question, in terms of the application of this policy, as to whether the $1,000 payment is the best approach. There is a debate to be had about the merits of paying a lump sum or, indeed, instalments, but I do see the argument that it is more likely that families in receipt of $1,000 would use that as a contribution towards an expensive service or an expensive piece of equipment. To that extent, I think that part of the weakness in proposing a one-off payment per year is mitigated. As I understand it, the package is $1.8 billion, of which $962 million would be provided to help older carers and their families. The federal government stated that this would translate into around 1,750 new supported accommodation places, 800 new respite places to be available by 2012 and additional in-home support and respite to assist older carers continue their caring role. At a total cost of $721.2 million, carers of around 130,000 children with disability under the age of 16 will receive $1,000 each year, with the first payment to be made next month, to assist with the purchase of necessary support such as wheelchairs, communication aids, therapy and respite. Finally, there is a $23.6 million expenditure over five years to enable respite, early intervention and other services for children in their local area. WhilstI have some quibbles about some of the policy and the way it applies, there will be people in my electorate who will benefit from this assistance. There is some concern, however, that the minister, who earlier had undertaken to match the states and territories fifty-fifty MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Families Community Services And Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment Child Disability Assistance Bill 2007
253,Mr Brendan O’connor (Gorton) (12.21 Pm),"I rise to support the Families, Comfor unmet needs for services, has withdrawn his undertaking. I am not sure of the impact that will have on the Commonwealth allocation of resources in this area, but it would seem to me that to withdraw a commitment that was earlier given would suggest there could well be some shortfall in allocation of funding in this very important area. I would hate to think that is the case, so I would hope the government can explain why it chose to withdraw its undertaking to match the amount made and paid by the states and territories. The other matter I wanted to touch upon, and the member for Pearce referred to it, was the carer adjustment payment. I am very much aware of the origin of the carer adjustment payment because the carer adjustment payment was introduced in response to a tragic story of Tyler Fishlock, a constituent of mine from Caroline Springs. Tyler, who was four years old at the time, lost his eyes to a rare cancer. His mother had to give up her teaching job in order to care for Tyler but was struggling to survive on the $46 per week that she was in receipt of. After much lobbying and a significant amount of promotion of the story through the media, the government announced a one-off grant of $10,000 to be paid to Tyler Fishlock’s family. That was certainly a sum that assisted that family. I applauded the efforts made by the government at the time and I am happy to do so again. There are issues about the application of this carer adjustment payment beyond the Fishlock family. This is the problem when you do make announcements-there was a heartrending story and the government responded. I was approached in May by Joanne Buttigieg, who is also, it so happens, from Caroline Springs. Joanne has two children with autism spectrum disorder. Her 11-year-old daughter has Asperger’s syndrome and has a generalised anxiety disorder, while her 9½-year-old son has severe autism, is nonverbal and is intellectually disabled. Immediately upon hearing of the $10,000 grant to Tyler Fishlock’s family, she approached Centrelink to ascertain how she could apply for a similar grant. In May-at the time of the announcement, the details were very sketchy-Joanne wrote to my office and said: My concern and that of several families I speak to, is the lack of information available to us about this disability grant. Also, the fact that the whole process appears to be riddled with inconsistencies and bias against families that do not have media support. Whether that is the case or not, I can well understand her concern and disappointment that she was not going to be in receipt of anything given her circumstances. Gradually, it emerged that, because her children were over six years of age, she was not eligible. Some families that she knew were eligible and others were not without there being an apparent connection to financial need or severity of disability. In June this year, Joanne wrote to me again and said: I do not think that my family is eligible as both children are over 6 years of age. This just does not seem right ... as both children were diagnosed just before the ages of 3 years. Also, their disability and all the challenges we face in trying to deal with them all on a daily basis with very little support, do not miraculously disappear at the age of 6. Indeed, the difficulties and challenges increase with age. Joanne is delighted that the Tyler Fishlock family was in receipt of support. She wishes them all the best. But there is an issue about the application of the carer adjustment payment. We are not sure whether it is based on merit. It is a real issue. It is a difficult issue, too. I concede the point that you have to work out the extent to which the Commonwealth can outlay resources. But, given the announcement made by the Prime Minister this year arising out of that particular case, it would have been best for the government to have considered the way that it MAIN COMMITTEE would apply the adjustment payment. I am not sure whether age is the right criteria to use when you are talking about disability. That is a real difficulty. I am supporting this bill, as you know. This matter does not refer specifically to the application of the carer adjustment payment, but the government has to come up with a better application of the payment-the $10,000-to families that are placed in very difficult circumstances. Some cynicism has arisen out of this matter, because there was so much media for that poor child and his family and about how his mother was coping in particular. Joanne’s feeling is that her not seeking to go to the media to raise the matter publicly was as much a reason why she was denied support than her actual eligibility for the payment. I have to say that it is hard for me to convince her otherwise-indeed, I am not convinced myself that the application of the payment was properly and fully considered by the government. I ask the minister to consider the application of the $10,000 one-off payment to families for children under the age of six with disabilities. The age threshold is not really the most relevant factor when determining assistance for children with disabilities, given Joanne’s comments. Quite honestly, in some circumstances it does not get easier but gets harder to look after a severely disabled child over the age of six. Therefore, the policy is deficient to that extent. I do not want to be entirely critical, because firstly I support the bill and secondly I support the fact that the government responded. But I think that it perhaps did not respond properly enough. I do not think that the way that it is applied is sound policy. I think that Joanne Buttigieg and her family-and many other families in my electorate and, indeed, in every electorate of this country-have a justifiable case to say that they are equally in need and deserving of support from the Commonwealth. Services and Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment (Child Disability Assistance) Bill 2007 and pleased to see the support of the opposition parties for it. The bill introduces a new payment called child disability assistance into the social security law. This assistance will be available to carers of disabled children under the age of 16 in respect of whom the carer receives carer allowance for the relevant period. The Australian government will provide funding of $721.2 million over five years to provide families caring for a child with disability who is aged less than 16 with an annual payment of $1,000. This money can be used for things such as helping with the purchase of a wheelchair, installation of a hoist in the family home and modifications to the family car, as well as for respite care or therapy. The government recognises that children with disabilities and their families have diverse needs which may change over time. Younger children with disability can benefit from early intervention and therapy to maximise their childhood developing and learning. The first payment of child disability assistance will be made in October 2007 through Centrelink, and payments will be made on 1 July 2008 and in July of subsequent years. The $1,000 annual payment will not be indexed and the child disability assistance will be exempt from tax. This payment will be well received by many parents-particularly in the electorate of Hasluck but I am sure across the country-who struggle every day to provide for their children suffering from a range of disabilities and to provide the best possible opportunities for them. I recently became acutely aware of the hardships that quite a number of amazing parents across my electorate of Hasluck endure. They are remarkable people whose energy seems MAIN COMMITTEE",187,Families Community Services And Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment Child Disability Assistance Bill 2007
254,Mr Henry (Hasluck) (12.33 Pm),"I am pleased to speak on the Families, Communityboundless given that they are raising a child or, in some cases, children with autism. Autism is a condition which affects a large number of children in Australia and, sadly, there is no known cure. Tragically, there are more children being diagnosed each year. The diagnosis of autism is not immediate; it takes some years to show. Often, when their child reaches the age of two, parents start to notice that their healthy child does not respond in the same ways that other children do. They appear to be disconnected and disassociated from the world and do not cope with too many stimulations. As these children grow they become more withdrawn, depending on their ‘functioning level’-that is a term often used by parents with an autistic child. Sadly, their life is ruled by the impact of influences that the child feels. Also sadly, dealing with an autistic child can bring relationships to breaking point. Many autistic children do not have the power of speech, so when a child with autism is upset and crying or screaming, as all children do, it is often impossible for the parent to diagnose whether their child has an earache, they have been stung by a bee or they are feeling stressed by something else. I have raised four daughters, so I know that when a child is crying it is relatively easy to find out what the cause of the problem is, what the pain is and how to remedy the problem, but parents of children with autism are not so fortunate. They have no way to determine what can set off their child; they just have to try everything they know to calm the situation. Bouts of crying or patterned behaviour can last for hours on end and the only thing parents can do is provide love and stay calm and in control so as not to exacerbate the situation and further add to the stress of the child. Parents with an autistic child do not have a great deal of support. They are left to try and navigate their child and the rest of their family through a minefield of uncertainty. It takes a long time to accept that your healthy, perfect-looking child through no fault of their own cannot play a part in normal family life. To not be able to show where it hurts, what is wrong or what you are frightened of must be a terrifying dilemma. There is no magic solution. It is a constant, tough grind all the way. As the child grows, they are often harder to help. Schools are not easy places for children who suffer autism. One of the common issues for them is that they do not like change; they cannot cope with things being slightly different from the way they were yesterday. Life with a child who suffers from autism is more than challenging, but I am truly amazed at the strength, energy and love that the parents of these children have. They take the hard road. Many are advised to place their children into care upon diagnosis of the condition. Most leave the doctor’s surgery and take their child home with the faith that they will cope, but they do occasionally need a hand. I was very pleased to hear the previous speaker, the member for Gorton, raise an issue about which I share the same level of concern-that is, about the parents of autistic children who have not been able to apply for the recently announced $10,000 carers adjustment payment. This has had a significant impact on a number of families in my electorate of Hasluck and those with autistic children. The member for Gorton went into some detail about that and he is absolutely right: the government should address this. There is an opportunity here to provide support for these people. To gain support, these parents have little choice but to write lengthy submissions begging for a small amount of funding to provide for some respite time. Their time is not their own unless they are lucky to get assistance with respite. Hopefully this can be addressed as a matter of urgency. I call on the minister, as the member for Gorton has, to address that. MAIN COMMITTEE As a government, we need to do more to help these parents. This new $1,000 payment will go some way to helping these good people, but there is more to do. While I want more done for autism-affected families and other families adversely affected by a disabled child or parent, it would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to the government for the vastly improved levels of funding across the entire disability sector. The government will provide some $13.6 billion to support people with disability, their families and carers. The main features are $9.7 billion to support people with disabilities through the disability support pension, mobility allowance, the sickness allowance, employment assistance and vocational rehabilitation; $2.9 billion to support carers, including through the carers allowance, carer payments, wife pension, respite and information services for younger carers, private provision for people with disability and peer support groups for parents of children with disability; and $992.8 million to support people with disability through the Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement, including supported employment services, Auslan and COAG commitments for younger people with disability in residential aged care, respite for older carers, and mental health. In June this year the Prime Minister, John Howard, announced the $1.8 billion disability assistance package, which we are debating here today. The key areas of this disability package include $721.2 million for carers of around 130,000 children with disability under the age of 16, who will receive $1,000 each to help with the purchase of support that best suits their needs; $962 million to help older carers and their families, providing around 1,750 new supported accommodation places and 800 new respite places by 2012, as well as extra in-home support and respite to older carers to continue care at home; and $236 million over five years to enable several services for children with disability to continue to provide much needed respite, early intervention and other services for children in their local area. There will also be an increased investment in employment services for people with disability, including $21.6 million for an extra 500 supported employment places in business services, $31 million to continue targeted support to people with disability who choose not to participate in supported employment and $21.8 million in viability support to help businesses in crisis. It would be very good to mention an organisation in my electorate, Perth Regional Roof Trusses, who have been very successful in employing people with hearing impairment. They have been supported in that process through an employment group called DEAFinite, who have provided a number of people who in effect are deaf. The proprietors of the business have learnt Auslan. They have done a fantastic job. Over 50 per cent of their employees are people who are so afflicted, and the morale and support in that organisation is truly a great credit to that organisation. They are all working manually with power saws and cutting timber and putting it together in, as I said, roof trusses. It is a fantastic organisation, and the fantastic commitment of the proprietors of that business is a great credit to them. On top of all this, the government is offering to contribute $3.275 billion to a multilateral agreement with the states and territories to deliver services in their own area of disability support, which are accommodation, respite, community support and community access. Unfortunately, as I understand it, the states have not come to the party in agreeing to those arrangements. In respect of my own state of Western Australia, this offer represents a provision of $215 million over five years beginning in 2007-08. In addition, the Australian government has MAIN COMMITTEE committed $12.1 million to help Western Australia achieve a net reduction in the number of young disabled people living in residential aged care. While speaking of WA and autism, which I was earlier, I mentioned a disturbing and disappointing story which has recently emerged in respect of autistic students getting educational assistance at a Perth school. Parents of autistic children at a special autism learning unit at the Allenswood Primary School in Greenwood, in Perth’s northern suburbs, had to make alternative education arrangements after the education department in WA abruptly shut the unit. The unit provided intensive education support for six autistic children. Parents said that they had received just three days notice before the end of term 2 that this unit would not be available in the third term, which is currently under way. The WA education department said the closure was due to the sudden resignation of the specialist teacher. It can only now say it is hopeful another teacher can be found for the start of school next year. This action by the WA department compounds the issues of both parents and students. Schools are not easy places for children who suffer autism. I mentioned earlier that one of the common issues for children with autism is that they do not like change and they cannot cope with things being even slightly different to the way that they were yesterday. This has had a serious impact on those young children who attended that school. It is a very unfortunate circumstance and I would hope that the Western Australia Department of Education moves even more quickly to rectify the situation. While this provides another challenge for the parents, it is also a prime example of the difficulties faced by parents of autistic children as it impacts so severely on the progress their kids were making. The Western Australia Department of Education could also get its finger out-can I say things like that in this chamber?-and seek to fill the vacancy as a matter of urgency. The WA Labor government likes to play fast and loose with the truth about Commonwealth funding. It is a standing joke in Western Australia when the Premier and his puppet master health minister, Jim McGinty, continue to defend the indefensible: their mismanagement of the public health system. The education system is somewhat similar, with a huge shortage of teachers across the state. They falsely claimed a lack of support from Canberra in the area of health, but they are caught out every time when they greedily line up for millions of dollars from the Commonwealth for funding things such as the disability assistance program. This program will enhance the quality of life for people with disabilities in Western Australia well into the future. The funding would make a substantial contribution to alleviating unmet need for disability support services in Western Australia, it would deliver additional disability services by non-government providers and it would ease pressure on existing services to the benefit of the disabled community in Western Australia. Earlier, I mentioned Perth Regional Roof Trusses. They have been here for the Prime Minister’s awards a couple of times. They were successful last year in winning one of those awards for smaller employers employing people with disabilities, which was certainly very encouraging and fantastic for them. I have had a number of visits there. I have been moved to ensure that they get as much exposure as they possibly can because of their commitment to their employees. I mentioned that they have fantastic morale there. I have been able to organise in the past visits to the business by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relation and also the Prime Minister. That was very well received. The expression of support from MAIN COMMITTEE those employees when the Prime Minister walked in to see what they were doing and what they had achieved was absolutely fantastic. They are not the only organisation in my electorate that do things for and with people with disabilities; there are a number of other employers who do that. One of the things that has resulted from the government’s good economic management has been that the reduction in unemployment has meant that people with disabilities have more employment opportunities than they might otherwise have had. The feedback from people in my electorate of Hasluck in particular has been that they really appreciate and enjoy that opportunity to become normal people, so to speak, in the workforce and make a contribution. It has been of significant benefit and value to them not only from a financial point of view but also from their own mental health perspective. They feel much more able to make a solid contribution to society and to their community. Their sense of well-being as a result of that is very significant. Through Perth Regional Roof Trusses and other businesses in the area, I have been able to observe that first hand. The flexibility that we now have in the workplace relations arrangements has also facilitated the employment of people with disabilities. As I mentioned earlier, the government has done a significant amount as far as this is concerned. I know I have been communicating with families in my electorate. Once the Prime Minister made this announcement of the $1.8 billion disability assistance package I had a meeting with a number of parents in my electorate office to discuss the impact and the value of that. I know that that $1,000 will be put to great use by a number of these parents in ensuring that their children have some practical opportunity for additional therapy, but also for wheelchairs and, importantly-this is something that I think we often overlook ourselvesthe modification of motor vehicles for people with disabilities. Whilst $1,000 often may not meet the total cost of that modification, it can go a long way towards achieving that. SoI strongly support the bill. vices and Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment (Child Disability Assistance) Bill 2007-and I thank the previous speaker for his contribution to assist me in getting to this chamber. The bill will introduce a new payment for child disability assistance into the social security law. Child disability assistance will be available to carers of disabled children under the age of 16 in respect of whom the carer receives carer allowance for the relevant period. There is a significant amount of funding being provided in this bill and it is something that I congratulate the minister on. We will see the first payments of the child disability assistance being made in October 2007, and payments in respect of 1 July 2008 and subsequent years will be made in the July of that relevant year. It will be an annual amount of $1,000, which will not be indexed, but the child disability assistance will be exempt from tax. This payment has been introduced because the government has recognised that children with disabilities have diverse needs that change over time. I am particularly involved in issues of child disability. I have seen the remarkable outcomes for children when endeavours are made towards early intervention so that children can have access to services made very soon after early diagnosis. The outcomes that come from that are extraordinary. Young children with disabilities can benefit from our early intervention and therapy, which maximises their learning and their ability to lead as close to a normal life as possible. Families and children also benefit from things such as respite care and a whole host of aids and equipment. MAIN COMMITTEE",189,Families Community Services And Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment Child Disability Assistance Bill 2007
255,Mrs Hull (Riverina) (12.50 Pm),"I rise today to support the Families, Community SerI want to raise to the attention of the House the endeavours of one of my local organisations, Kurrajong Early Intervention Service, which was able to get funding from the government through the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy. The government funded them to determine how we could work together in early childhood intervention and they have produced the book Team around the Child: Working together in early childhood intervention, which has achieved significant outcomes. It starts with the central being, the child of course, and goes on to include the family and the key workers such as the physiotherapists. It involves the family support worker being put in place. It involves the grandparents and significant others in the child’s life. It involves the childcare workers, the speech pathologists, the occupational therapists and the special educators. What we have seen is an unbelievable movement in the way we can provide family support in a multidisciplinary context across the life span of the child who has been diagnosed with a disability. This particular program was made possible by the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy. The capacity of the outreach part of this program, which went from the hub of Wagga Wagga out along the spokes to Temora, Tumut, Narrandera and other towns, to deliver to the families was extraordinary. The achievements and the improvements in the children’s developmental capacity was, I believe, nothing short of miraculous. That is something that is so important for us to consider. We have specific issues with an increasing range of autism spectrum disorders, including Asperger’s. Well in excess of 10,000 children across Australia have been diagnosed and are under treatment for autism spectrum disorder. That is the number diagnosed and in treatment. Maybe that amount again have autism spectrum disorder but are undiagnosed or do not have access to diagnostic opportunities or to the services that would be required on diagnosis. It is something that parents are particularly focused on. We need to try to ensure that governments, oppositions and the general Australian population recognise that as our children develop there needs to be constant effort put into providing aids, programs and equipment that can continue to improve the children’s responses and capacity. There needs to be home and vehicle modifications. Even things such as a hoist in the home would assist in the house or help with travel in the family car-travel that many of us take for granted. This is where this kind of payment helps. It helps purchase these kinds of aids for things that many of us just take for granted that we have the capacity to do. The new child disability assistance will assist carers with the purchase of many options that they may not have been able to afford. Primarily, they have to have a comparatively high income to be able to respond adequately and effectively to a disabled child’s needs. Not only that: there are families with a child with a diagnosed disability such as autism who go on to have other children only to find that that diagnosis applies to the other children-they may not have just one disabled child. In fact, I frequently come in contact with a young lady in my electorate-she is a young mum and is about four foot 11-who has three children who are severely disabled. She does a sensational job. When you have three children who require differing forms of aid programs and assistance-intervention services, maybe speech pathology, maybe something to do with their eyesight, maybe something to do with their motor skills-it is very, very expensive. It is extraordinarily costly and takes all of their money to provide the benefits and services that they believe that their children are entitled to. So it was especially pleasing to see that Minister Mal Brough-and I note that the minister is here-has continued to listen to the issues of people MAIN COMMITTEE with disabilities. He has continued to listen to the significant others in the lives of children and people with disabilities and has responded with the $1.8 billion announcement that was made in June. It is particularly pleasing to see that the government has continued to focus on issues of disability. CouldI come back to the book based in my electorate: Team around the Child. I must pay tribute to Sue Davies, who is the manager of Kurrajong Early Intervention Service. She is the most dedicated and committed person that I have ever seen-so much so that she is probably a little bit like me. She is exuberant and can sometimes be challenging for others to deal with. But she gets the results; that is the most important thing. ally, for her personal life; this is a result that Sue Davies has delivered as the Manager of Kurrajong Early Intervention Service to families right across my electorate and beyond. She has brought together a wide range of experience. The team consists of, as I said, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, special educators and family support workers. Through the Rural Beginnings Program, funded by the minister sitting here today in the chamber, she has been able to give hope and deliver enormous steps forward for our children with disabilities, their families and communities. Kurrajong Early Intervention Service was one of only 23 providers that were successful in obtaining a grant under the Australian government’s Early Childhood-Invest to Grow initiative to operate their Rural Beginnings Program. Their main goals have always been to work with families and their children to enable the children to reach their full potential and the families to function effectively and functionally as an accepted part of the community. That is the entitlement of all Australians-to be able to reach their full potential and function as a family regardless of the trials and tribulations of disabilities that may come. One of the main aims was to expand the evidence base of what works in early childhood intervention and to develop tools and resources to support other early childhood intervention services in rural and isolated areas. In many of the city areas we take it for granted that we can access the types of occupational services that we require. But certainly in rural areas they are very difficult to access. So this program was essential in exposing people to a suite of services to determine whether this could make a difference, and it certainly has made a difference. It has allowed Kurrajong Early Intervention Service to expand and develop their innovative model of early childhood intervention and their service delivery to rural areas around my electorate. More than one in 20 young children from nought to six years of age in New South Wales have a disability or a developmental delay. The first three years of life are critical to lay the foundations for what will happen over the life span. Our research shows that early childhood intervention can significantly improve the development and functioning of children with disabilities and developmental delays, make a substantial difference to families’ well-being and reduce both the children’s and families’ dependence on costly specialist services later in life, which is a cost to government and to the taxpayer. Investment in the early years will have substantial long-term benefits. For every dollar spent in early intervention there is a saving of $700 to the community. It is in these ways that early childhood intervention benefits us all and deserves the support of our entire community and our governments.

257,Mrs Hull,"Absolutely. She gets the results. This is not a result for Sue Davies personEarly childhood intervention really does make a difference, so the services that Kurrajong Early Intervention Service provide are simply so important. The best part about their book is that it will allow other professionals and service providers to take the information and the work that has been compiled by Kurrajong Early Intervention Service that has been found to be successful in delivering results and to incorporate these well-documented measures into their own services and practices. The book also addresses the difficult problems of recruitment and retention of therapists to country areas and it recognises this through, as I have indicated previously, the hub and spoke structure. As I have indicated, the organisation received funding under Stronger Families and Communities of $1.5 million over the years 2004 to 2008. I truly believe that this is a really great example of the community taking responsibility and applying guidelines to manage early intervention within communities in various areas of population and availability of services. The Rural Beginnings Project has enabled the expansion of these services to the areas of Tumut, Tumbarumba, Gundagai, Temora, Cootamundra, Junee, Narrandera, Lockhart and Coolamon, with between 60 to 70 families in these areas alone supported through this program. There is a team of 24 people and each year there are up to 200 children just from those small areas on their books. Kurrajong Early Intervention Service is regarded as a lighthouse program and a best practice service. The book has the potential to be a timely catalyst in Australian early intervention for children. AgainI take the opportunity to congratulate the Kurrajong Early Intervention Team on the work that they have done with the model and the book. It is so fantastic to see the innovative ideas and exciting practices that will now be able to be followed by many throughout Australia and even on an international level. You can pick up many programs from this book and drop them into so many communities. I support this bill entirely. It will improve the quality of life for around 130,000 children with a disability, their families and their carers, and it is a practical way in which we as federal members and as a government can help with difficult, challenging and lifelong tasks that may be undertaken in caring for a child with a disability. I commend the bill. I commend Kurrajong Early Intervention Service and I commend the staff and the dedicated and committed people who provide a service well and truly above and beyond their financial remuneration. If you were to factor in the hours that they put in out of their own valuable recreation time-time that they are not spending with their families or doing things of pleasure for themselves-you would see the great amount of effort they devote to children. I commend the bill to the House and thank the minister for his unrelenting support of families supporting children with a disability.

But we have to accept that every day is also a struggle such that many think, ‘But for the grace of God there go I.’ When the Prime Minister and I announced the $1.8 billion package of which this is part, the thing that really appalled me was that this was such good news but the media hardly did a thing with it. I say this from the bottom of my heart because these people need to know that there are taxpayers out there who are happy to see their money assisting them via Commonwealth spending. As a cabinet we sat around and we thought about this $1,000 payment. I am going to come to where and why we came to this payment in a moment, but we thought: should we restrict this to things such as some of the things that the member for Riverina has been talking about-harnesses, alterations to cars to allow people with physical disabilities to be able to get in and out, swings to get them into baths and that sort of thing? We thought no. We thought that, if you have what it takes to be a parent of one or even more than one disabled child, you do not need a bureaucrat or a government to tell you how to spend every last cent you have in the best interests of your family. Quite frankly, if what is going to help some child is a big plasma television, you go right ahead and buy one. On the other hand, if you need to buy some respite, if you need to do some sort of intervention in the home, do it. I want people to know that this is not a one-off; this is forever. This is forever under a Howard government-a coalition government, anyway; I cannot speak for anyone else. This is what we are committing to not just today but into the future. It is not a one-off payment. What it means is that parents can actually plan for what they want to do with this money for their children, to just make that life a little bit easier. That is why it is so important. Where did it come from? During the speeches from the members for Jagajaga and Gorton, one or two of them asked, ‘Why doesn’t this go beyond 16-year-olds?’ The reason we are actually here is that I, as the minister, and the Prime Minister have quite frankly had a gutful of trying to deal with state governments who have been responsible for these groups and have not stepped up to the plate. We felt we could hand another $1.6 billion over to the states, and hope and pray they would give the money to the children who need it and other groups, or we could actually cut out the middleman and go straight to the person and let them buy the intervention that they needed. I was a very strong advocate for that, because we have a thing called the Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement, and it goes for five years. The first one was in 1991; the last one was due for renegotiation and finished on June 2007-and, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that that has elapsed. We do not have another five-year agreement, the reason being that on 3 April, I think, in Brisbane every Labor state minister walked out on me as the Commonwealth minister when I put an offer on the table saying the Commonwealth would put not a dollar limited amount but a fifty-fifty deal with the states and territories to actually do something positive for people with disabilities. They walked out of the room. They caucused, they came back, they read a statement and they declared the meetMAIN COMMITTEE ing closed without comment. That is the sort of reaction we got from Labor state governments and territory governments-universally, unanimously. I came back to the Prime Minister and said that we as a Commonwealth have a duty of care. We are a wealthy country. We are in the best financial shape we have ever been in and, as the minister, I feel that there is no alternative but for us to try and do something practical. I had people, the sector, say to me: ‘Please do something for us but don’t just have two systems, because that is what we tried to overcome in 1991. Don’t have all of the duplications. You don’t do a bit and they don’t do a bit and you end up with all of this blame game.’ Hence we have gone directly to them. We have said we will do this for children under the age of 16 and that will be the cut-off. The Commonwealth is now putting $1.8 billion additional new money into disabilities, which is money that represents a 55 per cent increase to our contribution. We have not stopped there. We also have made a guarantee, which I am very passionate about, for the first time in this nation’s history to these same sort of parents who, when the child is five and six today, will still be caring for their child-their daughter, their son-when the child is 40 and 50 and they are 70, 80 and even 90 years of age. Do you know what these people want? Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that you are aware of this, and I know that the member for Gilmore is very aware of it because she has been to see me about Anglicare and Havenlee in Nowra, in her electorate, trying to have respite. What worries them is that they have given their entire life to their child, almost given up their own life because they want to give something to the one they have brought into this world, and their biggest fear is: ‘What will happen when I am too frail or I die? Who is going to look after my child? Will they be abused? Will they be neglected? Where will they go?’ The fear that is in their hearts is palpable when you sit there in front of them. They are not asking for anything for themselves-no thankyous, no medals; all they want to know is that their kid is going to be safe. Under the package that the Prime Minister and I announced, we gave that guarantee. We now have people in the field talking to every carer aged over 65 who has been caring long term for a child about giving them a plan that will suit them. Some of it will be in their own home. Some of it will be in shared accommodation. Some of it will be with HACC style interventions. It will be through all sorts of things, but it will be what is important to them. Again, that had to happen because the states and territories were not interested in doing that. I think that is a great shame on us as Australians and on them as state and territory Labor governments. That is why we are here. That is why we are doing that and that is why, when the opposition asks me these questions, these are the answers. It is because they have been failed by another level of government. We could have simply said, ‘I am sorry but, since 1991, the deal has been that that is the responsibility of the states-and they won’t do it.’ How the hell do you turn your back on people that have done that? When you have the wealth that this country has, you cannot do that. I am really proud to be part of a government that has said we will not do that and we will move forward. Why don’t we have another five-year agreement? Because the states and territories, believe it or not, in 2007 will not agree to accountability and transparency. That is what the delay has been. But I think I have nearly got them there; we should have them there in November. But we would not have another agreement without external validation of supported accommodation. Let me put that into plain language. It means that when someone is disabled and they need other people to live with them and support them in their living on an everyday basis-in MAIN COMMITTEE other words, shared accommodation, hostels, community living-up until now, in many cases, there have been no checks and balances as to the safety of those people who live in community housing. I have seen the worse of it in my own electorate, where people have faced charges because of that. Would anyone think for a moment that any Australian government would stand here today and say, ‘We will remove external validation of aged care’? You would not get away with it-and nor should you get away with it. If we said we will no longer apply standards to child care, we would not get away with that either. But the states have been responsible for disabilities-and you can have shared accommodation, supported accommodation, and not have external validation. It was an aspiration under the last five-year agreement. The Commonwealth entered into that aspirational goal. We fulfilled our responsibility and we do have external validation for business services-what people used to know as sheltered workshops. They have the checks and balances there, but many of the states have not done it or have done it to an inappropriate level. We, the Commonwealth, have demanded that that happen in this agreement, or there will be no agreement. We will take them to the table. I wonder whether, if there is a change of government, we will have that same level of determination by a Rudd Labor government. I guarantee you we will not. So external validation, access for Aboriginals-the First Australians-and transparency and accountability are the reasons why we will still be trying to get a Commonwealth-state disability agreement. Why did we withdraw the fifty-fifty deal? Because when I put a fifty-fifty deal on the table they walked out. I wrote to them. They wrote back and said, ‘We’ll think about it and consider it and we might do something.’ The agreement was due to expire on 30 June-not to be renegotiated, but to expire. People out there were very fearful of what was going to happen, so the Commonwealth-the Prime Minister and I-acted and we announced this. Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the ACT came to the party and we have supported them, but Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania said no. It says a hell of a lot about what they think of people with disabilities. Quite frankly, the disingenuous comments from those opposite-such as ‘Why does this cut off above 16-year-olds?’ and ‘Why haven’t you done the CSTDA yet?’-mean either that they are ignorant or playing politics with the most vulnerable and needy people in the community. The reality is that we have put $1.8 billion into this because we can afford it and because we should do so. We should no longer allow state and territory governments to simply say, ‘We’re not putting our hand up, we are not doing it, and that is just too bad for these families.’ They deserve every single cent that we can give them. They deserve our support and they deserve the admiration of the Australian public. As many of them often say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to me, imagine what the cost would be if we abdicated our responsibility. They would never do that. They love their children far too much. But the cost would be phenomenal. Today, as the member for Riverina said, with things such as Asperger’s unfortunately growing for some reason that I cannot explain and the many other intellectual issues that beset so many of our young people, we as a nation owe it to those families to give them every support. This is a practical measure that the Commonwealth government has introduced. It is something that I know will make a difference in people’s lives. We are delighted that we have a strong enough economy that we can do it. We will continue to support these people into the future. I commend the bill to the House. MAIN COMMITTEE Question agreed to.

Rearrangement That order of the day No. 2 be postponed until a later hour. Question agreed to. Cognate bill: 2007 Second Reading Debate resumed from 21 June, on motion by Mr Pearce: That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment (Discretionary Mutual Funds and Direct Offshore Foreign Insurers) Bill 2007 and the Corporations (National Guarantee Fund Levies) Amendment Bill 2007. Labor supports both these bills. The Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Discretionary Mutual Funds and Direct Offshore Foreign Insurers) Bill 2007 implements the approach to the regulation of DMFs and DOFIs announced by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer on 3 May 2007. Under the approach, DOFIs will be prudentially regulated under the Insurance Act. DMFs will not be prudentially regulated, but information will be collected to determine the nature and the scope of their operations. The bill addresses an outstanding HIH royal commissioner’s recommendation and a regulatory gap identified in the International Monetary Fund’s 2006 financial sector assessment program for Australia. The bill also makes a minor amendment to support changes made by the Corporations (National Guarantee Fund Levies) Amendment Bill 2007, the NGF bill. The NGF bill will impose a cap on levies payable for the benefit of the NGF. The bill introduces a regime for the collection of information on DMFs. This will be complemented by enhanced disclosure requirements under the corporations regulations. Information will be collected on both the nature and scope of the business of DMFs. APRA will collect information on the nature and scope of the business of DMFs’ business and the role of DMFs in the Australian risk management market. This collection will occur through an amendment to FSCODA, which is the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act. ASIC will collect information from AFSL holders and authorised representatives who deal in DMF products on the business that they are placing with DMFs. This information will be collected under an existing provision in the Corporations Act through an amendment to the corporations regulations. Information collected by the regulators will be used to review within three years the need to prudentially regulate DMFs.

259,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (1.21 Pm),I move:,200,Corporations National Guarantee Fund Levies Amendment Bill
260,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (1.22 Pm),"I rise to speak on the Financial Sector Legislationquirements will be strengthened through the corporations regulations to require DMFs to disclose the key characteristics of their product to both prospective retail and wholesale clients. The bill strengthens and clarifies the definition of ‘insurance business’ in the Insurance Act to capture DOFIs that carry on insurance business in Australia either directly or through the actions of another-for example, an insurance agent or a broker. As a result, DOFIs that fit within this expanded definition will be required to be authorised under the Insurance Act. As authorised general insurers, they will be required to comply with Australia’s general insurance standards, including having a presence and assets here in Australia. Foreign reinsurers are not captured by the expanded definition and, hence, will not be subject to regulation under the Insurance Act unless they choose to establish a branch or subsidiary in Australia. Lloyd’s underwriters are not captured under this expanded definition but they will remain subject to regulation under part VII of the Insurance Act. The bill includes regulation making that will enable limited exemptions to be made under the insurance regulations to allow risks that cannot be placed through an authorised insurer to be placed with insurers not authorised in Australia. The general insurance prudential standards made under the Insurance Act will be modified by APRA to take account of the risk profiles of the different categories of authorised insurers. The modifications of the general insurance prudential standards will be risk focused. To ensure that regulation of DOFIs is effective, APRA has been given additional enforcement powers in this bill. APRA will now be able to investigate persons it believes are carrying on insurance business without being authorised and those persons aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring this activity. These investigation powers include a power to access the premises of persons and a power to gather information from persons under investigation. APRA will have the power to seek an injunction from the Federal Court of Australia restricting unauthorised activity. To complement these changes, the bill includes a prohibition in the Corporations Act on AFSL holders and authorised representatives from dealing in a general insurance product unless it is from an authorised insurer or a Lloyds’s underwriter or subject to an exemption. Under the Corporations Act, information will be collected from AFSL holders and authorised representatives on business placed with insurers that are not authorised in Australia. Basically the bill is aimed at improving regulatory protection for consumers and businesses who purchase general insurance products here in Australia. The HIH royal commission report was tabled in parliament on 16 April 2003. Labor’s only concern is: why has it taken over four years to close the regulatory gaps identified in that report? The Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Discretionary Mutual Funds and Direct Offshore Foreign Insurers) Bill 2007 makes a minor amendment to support changes made by the Corporations (National Guarantee Fund Levies) Amendment Bill 2007, the NGF bill. The National Guarantee Fund is the compensation scheme for the Australian Securities Exchange. The measure caps the amount of levies payable each year, if needed, to top up the fund, thereby removing the concurrent uncapped exposure for participants. Importantly, the changes do not affect investors’ ability to claim from that fund. The NGF bill imposes a cap on levies payable for the benefit of the NGF in any financial year equal to the minimum amount of the National Guarantee Fund. The NGF provides investor protection for certain transactions on MAIN COMMITTEE the Australian Securities Exchange and levies are payable to be collected when the fund falls below the amount required to be retained in the fund. This amount is the minimum amount of the fund, as set by the Corporations Act. The change provides greater certainty about the global liability of the Australian Securities Exchange and market participants to refill the National Guarantee Fund. It removes the potential for unlimited liability to refill the NGF. The Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Discretionary Mutual Funds and Direct Offshore Foreign Insurers) Bill 2007 also makes a minor change to the Corporations Act to support the NGF bill. The NGF bill is therefore included with the bill as a package of reforms. Note that the capping of levies is unrelated to the reforms dealing with either the DOFIs or the DMFs. The NGF was created to meet valid claims arising from dealings with dealers-for example, when a dealer has bought and paid for securities on a person’s behalf but has not provided the securities to the individual purchaser because an individual may make a claim. The fund was created when the six state stock markets merged to form the national ASX in 1987. The assets of the state fidelity funds were merged to form the fund. The assets as at 30 June 2006 were approximately $96.8 million, compared with $93.9 million at the end of June 2005. Labor supports the bills. start by thanking all of those members who have taken part in this very important debate on the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Discretionary Mutual Funds and Direct Offshore Foreign Insurers) Bill 2007 and the Corporations (National Guarantee Fund Levies) Amendment Bill 2007. With regard to the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Discretionary Mutual Funds and Direct Offshore Foreign Insurers) Bill 2007, both the 2003 report of the HIH royal commissioner and the International Monetary Fund’s 2006 Financial Sector Assessment Program identified a potential regulatory gap with regard to direct offshore foreign insurers. This bill addresses this identified gap and it will ensure that consumers and businesses that purchase a general insurance product in Australia can be confident that they will be protected by Australia’s world-class prudential regime. It also provides for the equitable prudential treatment of locally incorporated and offshore foreign insurers who carry on insurance business in Australia. This bill will encourage competition and innovation in the Australian general insurance market and further enhance Australia’s overseas reputation as a sound and well-regulated market. The bill also facilitates a reduction in the regulatory and compliance costs for insurers carrying on business in Australia by providing for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to adopt a more risk focused approach to prudential regulation. Under the refinements to the general insurance prudential framework, prudential standards will be aligned with the risk posed by different classes of insurers, with the result that categories of insurers posing a lower risk will face reduced regulatory costs. This is good news for our domestic insurers and those organisations looking to establish a presence in Australia. To address concerns that there may be some insurance risks that cannot be appropriately placed with an authorised insurer, the bill allows exemptions for these risks. Following further consultation with interested stakeholders, the exemptions will be developed through the insurance regulations. With respect to discretionary mutual funds, DMFs, the bill will allow Australians to continue to have access to this form of risk management product if they wish. The bill also extends disclosure requirements to enable consumers to make informed decisions about whether MAIN COMMITTEE",200,Corporations National Guarantee Fund Levies Amendment Bill
261,Mr Dutton (Dickson,"Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (1.30 pm)-Isuch a product best suits their needs. At the same time, the government will gather information on the role of DMFs in the risk management market and review whether or not to prudentially regulate these entities within three years. I will now move to the Corporations (National Guarantee Fund Levies) Amendment Bill 2007. This bill makes minor changes to the levying arrangements for the benefit of the National Guarantee Fund while reducing red tape and compliance costs for banks. This change is also supported by a minor amendment to the Corporations Act 2001 which is included in the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Discretionary Mutual Funds and Direct Offshore Foreign Insurers) Bill 2007. The National Guarantee Fund is the compensation scheme for investors on the ASX. The measures in both bills address uncapped levying abilities for the benefit of the National Guarantee Fund and will set in place a cap on the amount of levies payable by market participants per financial year. The changes remove the potential unlimited liability of participants to refill the fund. The unlimited liability currently prevents banks from participating directly on the ASX market. Instead, banks must incorporate subsidiaries to participate on the market. This approach will facilitate banks participating directly without the cost currently involved. Investors will not be affected by the changes. In conclusion, this measure clearly furthers the government’s commitment to reducing red tape burden and compliance costs. I thank those individuals and organisations that provided input to the development of both of these bills and I commend these bills to the House. Question agreed to. Bills read a second time.

The proposed amendments to the bill ensure that all of section 118 of the Insurance Act 1973 applies to companies, and the existing disqualification provisions will be extended to apply to the directors and senior managers of the company agent.

The amendment will provide annual certainty of the maximum possible levy in a financial year which will be known at the start of the financial year. This greater certainty will allow the banks the choice to participate directly on the ASX market without the need for subsidiaries, as is the case now.

The bill also amends part 23 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, otherwise known as the SI(S) Act, so that, where a fund has suffered a loss as a result of fraudulent conduct or theft, financial assistance is available on a more equitable basis. It also makes technical amendments that are consequential to the enactment of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. Labor supports this bill. However, I will be moving a second reading amendment to remove the new restriction on compensation and call, in principle, for losses in the event of an employer insolvency to be covered. Further, I note the need for major simplification of the currently unreadable, complex and costly disclosure regime. Schedule1 of this bill amends the Banking Act 1959, the Insurance Act 1973, the Life Insurance Act 1995, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and other related legislation, including the Corporations Act 2001 and the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001, to implement government commitments relating to prudential regulation in response to Rethinking regulation, the report of the Taskforce on Reducing Regulatory Burdens on Business, otherwise known as the Banks report. It also introduces additional measures to streamline and simplify the prudential acts in a manner which is consistent with the regulation task force’s findings.

264,Mr Bowen (Prospect) (4.00 Pm),"The Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Simfraudulent conduct or theft, financial assistance is available on a more equitable basis. The amendments also abolish the special protection account. The prudential framework within Australia is widely acknowledged as meeting its broad objectives. Rethinking regulation found that Australia’s financial and corporate sectors and the associated regulatory structures are highly regarded internationally and that ‘the broad policy framework has widespread support within business and the wider community in Australia’. However, Rethinking regulation also noted that there is scope to improve the regulatory framework in some areas and made recommendations to improve the flexibility of the framework, harmonise aspects of the framework with the Corporations Act and improve the coordination between the key financial sector regulators-that is, APRA and ASIC. The government accepted the recommendations in Rethinking regulation that were relevant to prudential regulation. Recommendation 5.4 of Rethinking regulation states that the government should ensure that APRA has sufficient flexibility to tailor requirements to accommodate the differing circumstances. It should also be flexible to cater for the diverse range of entities operating within the financial sector. The government has made some changes in this regard through recent reforms to the prudential framework for both general insurers and superannuation funds, implemented through the General Insurance Reform Act 2001 and the Superannuation Safety Amendment Act 2004. These amendments build on these initiatives through further reforms to streamline and improve the flexibility of the prudential framework. The prudential acts administered by APRA and related legislation, such as the Corporations Act, have often evolved separately and in response to industry developments. There is scope to refine and update the four prudential acts to make them more consistent. Rethinking regulation highlighted breach reporting under the prudential acts and the Corporations Act as a particular area where there is scope to improve consistency and reduce the compliance burden. These amendments address concerns in this area. On4 December 2006, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer released a paper entitled ‘Streamlining prudential regulation: response to Rethinking regulation’ to facilitate discussion on the government’s proposed various responses to the Rethinking regulation recommendations and the outstanding HIH royal commission recommendations as well as additional reforms to streamline and simplify the prudential acts in a manner that is consistent with the regulation task force’s findings. The amendments in the bill give effect to most of the proposals in that paper. The changes do improve efficiency and streamline the regulatory application by APRA and ASIC as well as reduce some overload. To that extent the changes are welcome, with one exception, and represent useful, practical red tape reduction. However, to the extent that red tape is reduced, it is the government that has imposed the current red tape regulatory web on financial services over the past 11½ years. With respect to one specific proposal, the whistle-blowing provision, Labor would have preferred a more general provision to apply rather than the different requirements operating concurrently. The consequence of this change will be greater complexity, additional red tape and unnecessary costs. MAIN COMMITTEE In relation to schedule 2, part 23 of the SI(S) Act provides for a grant of financial assistance for certain superannuation entities that suffer a loss as a result of fraudulent conduct or theft, subject to certain conditions. In 2003 the government announced a review of part 23 and released a consultation paper seeking written submissions on the operation of part 23 and associated levy process under the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Act 1993. The government released the outcomes of the review in 2004. Following the review the government agreed to expand eligibility for financial assistance under part 23 to ensure treatment is more equitable. However, this also includes a new limitation as detailed in the last dot point, which is that it removes compensation in the event of an employer failing to pay contributions under part 23. That last provision that I just referred to will apply to a new limitation on compensation in the event of theft and fraud when an employer has not made their compulsory superannuation guarantee payments. Labor does not agree with this new restriction and our second reading amendment reflects this. Further compulsory superannuation is effectively deferred wages and, unlike statutory entitlements, is not compensable in the event of employer insolvency through the GEER Scheme. Approximately 10,000 Australians lose between $20 million and $30 million a year as a consequence of this. Labor believes compensation in these circumstances should be examined and, again, our second reading amendment reflects this. Finally, this legislation does nothing to cut the complex, costly and unreadable level of disclosure documentation, often running to 50 or 100 pages, imposed by this government in the financial services legislation. As we have said consistently, we will take an axe to this regime by introducing simple, standard, threeto four-page disclosures on a product-by-product basis and the complex lengthy documents will only be provided on request. This is something welcomed by the industry and also welcomed by consumers. It is also the case that the current regime, as we have said many times, creates a level of complacency on behalf of investors because some people assume that, because there are 50 to 100 pages worth of disclosure documents, the product must therefore be safe. I have had this experience in my own electorate-people coming to me who have invested in funds which have failed and saying, ‘But I thought it was safe because they gave me 100 pages worth of disclosure documents.’ Clearly, this is counterproductive. Our second reading amendment reflects the announced policy in this regard. I take this opportunity to formally move the second reading amendment circulated in my name: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) notes that the Liberal Government is imposing a new restriction to Part 23 compensation, paid in the event of theft and fraud if an employer fails to pay compulsory superannuation contributions and supports Labor’s calls on the government to remove this new restriction; (2) notes that there is no compensation for compulsory superannuation payments in the event of employer insolvency; (3) acknowledges that compulsory superannuation payments are effectively deferred wages but unlike other statutory entitlements such as annual leave, redundancy pay and unpaid wages superannuation is not covered by the General Employees Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS) resulting in up to 10,000 employees a year standing to lose between $20 to $30 million in superannuation contributions a year and supports Labor’s calls on the government to investigate compensation in these circumstances”. MAIN COMMITTEE Ms Burke-I second the amendment. Firstly, I take this opportunity to thank those members who have taken part in the debate on the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Simplifying Regulation and Review) Bill 2007. This bill introduces measures to streamline, harmonise and simplify prudential regulation of the financial sector. It implements the government’s commitments in response to Rethinking regulation, the report of the Taskforce on Reducing Regulatory Burdens on Business. The task force found that Australia’s financial and corporate sectors and the associated regulatory structures have broad support within the business community in Australia and are well regarded internationally. The rethinking regulation task force noted, however, that there is scope to improve the regulatory framework in some areas so as to reduce the compliance and the reporting burden on prudentially regulated businesses. The government accepted all the recommendations in Rethinking regulation relevant to prudential regulation. Most of those recommendations which require legislative amendment have been included as measures in this bill. The bill cuts red tape by removing regulatory overlaps, providing greater flexibility for APRA to tailor prudential requirements to particular circumstances and removing unnecessary or outdated provisions. In particular, it will reduce compliance costs for businesses by reducing duplication in breach reporting. It also introduces a more equitable process for making claims for superannuation funds that have suffered a loss as a result of fraudulent activity. These measures have been subject to extensive consultation through the release of a proposals paper, an exposure draft of the bill and an industry roundtable discussion on the draft bill. I thank those organisations and individuals that provided input into the development of this bill. Treasury will continue to work with industry to ensure the smooth implementation of the measures in this bill and the government will keep the measures in this bill under review to ensure that they operate as intended, to both maintain appropriate prudential controls and to minimise compliance burdens for business. Australia has a strong financial services sector which has grown markedly as a result of the reforms of the Howard government over the past decade. The Howard government remains committed to reducing red tape and to ensuring that Australia’s prudential system remains efficient, effective and flexible in order to help our financial services sector grow into the future. The government has indicated that it will keep provisions in relation to whistleblower changes under review. I do want to take this opportunity to again thank members who have contributed to this debate. I commend this bill to the House. time. To this the honourable member for Prospect has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. Question agreed to. Original question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

268,Mr Dutton (Dickson,"Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (4.13 pm)-byOmit “Prudential Rules or in”. These proposed amendments to the bill are minor in nature and generally result from drafting errors. The amendments will ensure that the reforms being introduced by the bill operate as intended. Amendment (1) excludes division 3A of part III of the Insurance Act, which deals with the transfer and amalgamation of insurance business, from the list of provisions for which the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority can grant an exemption. This ensures that the list of modifiable provisions is consistent with the proposals announced in ‘Streamlining prudential regulation: response to Rethinking regulation’. Amendment (2) repeals section 49D of the Insurance Act dealing with self-incrimination as new section 38F of the Insurance Act will provide protection from self-incrimination. Collectively, amendments (3) and (14) give effect to the phasing out of prudential rules in subsection 16C(4) of the Life Insurance Act 1995, the life act, by 30 June 2011. Amendment (4) ensures that use immunity provided under section 130B is retained. Amendment (7) ensures that section 336F dealing with self-incrimination does not apply to sections 129 or 130 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, the SI(S) Act, as self-incrimination in respect of these sections as dealt with by section 130B. Amendment (8) inserts a note to clarify that section 130B, which deals with self-incrimination, applies to sections 129 and 130. Amendment (9) renumbers the note that already exists as a result of amendment (8). The bill currently includes section 113 of the SI(S) Act in the list of modifiable provisions. However, section 113 is being repealed and replaced by the new section 35C. Amendments (5) and (6) ensure that the correct section is included in the list of modifiable provisions under the SI(S) Act. Amendment (10) makes a consequential amendment to paragraph 121AO(2)(a) of the Income Assessment Act 1936 as a result of schedule 1 of the bill, abolishing the Life Insurance Actuarial Standards Board and removing the concept of actuarial standards from the life act from 1 January 2008. Sections 87 and 95 of the life act respectively require a life company to notify APRA when it appoints an auditor and actuary for the company. Amendments (11) and (12) ensure that additional matters to be included in the notice are dealt with in prudential standards rather than prescribed under the Life Insurance Regulations Act 1995. This is consistent with the principles based approach adopted in the bill, which provides that specific requirements relating to auditors and actuaries be set out in prudential standards. Amendment (13) ensures that regulations and prudential rules made under the life act are considered part of the act. Full details of the amendments can be found in a supplementary explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported to the House with amendments. Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 August, on motion by Mr Turnbull: That this bill be now read a second time. MAIN COMMITTEE eration Trust Amendment Bill 2007, noting that this is essentially an administrative bill which amends the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act 2001 and extends the date by which the act is to be repealed, from September 2011 to 19 September 2033. I note that this extension supports an agreement reached between the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments for a transfer of crown land at North Head to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust until 2032. This bill will ensure that the trust is still in place when the North Head site is transferred back to the New South Wales government 25 years from now. The former School of Artillery at North Head is one of eight sites around Sydney Harbour managed under the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act. The others are Cockatoo Island; the Macquarie Light Station; the former Marine Biological Station at Watsons Bay; Georges Heights, Chowder Bay and Middle Head; Woolwich Dock and parklands; Snapper Island; and HMAS Platypus. These are all significant public places. They are certainly all prime real estate, and some of them are jewels in Sydney Harbour’s crown. Labor supports this bill because the Sydney Harbour trust does important work and is generally well regarded. The trust mandate to maximise public access, clean up contamination and preserve the heritage and environmental values of its historic sites is a worthy one and a mandate that should be fully realised. Labor has expressed concerns in the past and we are aware of concerns that still exist about maintaining community access to trust sites over the long term. In supporting this bill we reaffirm our intention to monitor the trust’s activities closely and ensure the good work that has been done to date continues. In supporting this bill I note that the trust is one of the few examples we can point to over the last decade of successful Commonwealth heritage management. The Sydney Harbour Federation Trust stands out against this government’s predominantly poor record of protecting and conserving Australia’s national estate. This bill provides an opportunity to focus attention on that record. This government’s approach to heritage has been characterised in equal parts by neglect and overt politicisation. It is an approach which is signposted at the very top, because this is a government that no longer has a minister for heritage. In terms of signals they do not come much starker than that. It is a sad indictment of the government’s thinking, or perhaps lack of thinking, about heritage matters. A cliched refrain from the Howard government is that practical actions matter more than symbolism. Heritage protection and conservation is one area in which symbolism and actions are inseparable and where having a minister for heritage provides a fundamental recognition of what this country values. When we recognise our heritage we affirm that nothing is more central to Australia’s national identity than our history, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and our respect for those who made history. Also central to Australia’s identity is our great natural environment. I know that we are well aware that we are blessed with natural places of breathtaking beauty and real ecological importance. Australia’s heritage, shaped by nature and history, is an inheritance passed from one generation to the next. It is the responsibility of us, the present generation, to nourish and nurture the inheritance for future generations. It is like a bargain that is struck, in effect, between those who currently exercise responsibility and sometimes authority and those by whom the decisions that we make will have to be borne. Respecting our heritage means actively engaging with our past and our sense of place. It is not something that we can afford to take for granted. As I have noted for 11 long years, the MAIN COMMITTEE",211,Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Simplifying Regulation And Review Bill 2007
269,Mr Garrett (Kingsford Smith) (4.17 Pm),"Labor supports the Sydney Harbour FedHoward government’s approach to heritage has been characterised by, we say, political interference and neglect. It seems that if it cannot be used for political advantage it does not get a mention. We have seen this approach played out in the abolition of the independent Australian Heritage Commission in 2003, the expiry of the Register of the National Estate, the slashing of Commonwealth funding for World Heritage places and the destructive ANZAC Cove roadworks. Heritage listings have become too slow and the listing processes opaque. Heritage promotion activities have withered and, as a result, we have seen a diminishing of those national conversations about heritage, the genuine engagement with communities around Australia, that are crucial to understanding and recognising heritage values. In the past Labor has been a world leader in the protection, conservation and promotion of heritage. I know that is an expression that the minister likes to use, and I think it is fair for us to use it here in relation to our past record on World Heritage and more generally our protection and conservation of heritage. This is a proud record that was begun under a Labor government in the 1970s. It was the Whitlam government and the Hon. Tom Uren who created the Australian Heritage Commission and the Register of the National Estate. I want to pay special tribute in the House today to the work of Gough Whitlam and Tom Uren. In 1973, the Whitlam government set up a committee of inquiry tasked with evaluating our natural and built environment, Aboriginal sites and places of historical and archaeological significance. This committee found that ‘the Australian government has inherited a national estate which has been downgraded, disregarded and neglected’. Two recommendations were made: firstly, the establishment of a permanent statutory authority to work with state and local government voluntary groups and the public for the protection, conservation and presentation of the national estate; secondly, that a fundamental task of this body would be a survey of the national estate and an inventory of its components. Whilst the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 had clear limitations, it nevertheless embodied specific, clear principles and enduring protections for Australia’s heritage places. An independent statutory authority, the Australian Heritage Commission, was established in July 1976 and it was provided with a mandate on its own motion or at the request of the minister to give advice on matters relating to the national estate, including advice relating to action to identify, conserve, improve and present the national estate, to identify places included in the national estate and to prepare a register of those places. The Australian Heritage Commission and the Register of the National Estate are significant achievements. It is a great shame, and it says much about the present government’s record, that some three decades later we have witnessed their demise. In 2003, the stand-alone Australian Heritage Commission was abolished under the Howard government and substituted with the Australian Heritage Council-an advisory body specifically and effectively controlled by the Department of the Environment and Water Resources. The absence of an independent body offering arms-length advice on Australian heritage risks the politicisation of listing processes. Additionally, a closed-door approach to Australia’s heritage diminishes the scope for genuine community engagement and the national conversations that I referred to earlier, which are central to understanding and recognising heritage values. Since its inception, the Register of the National Estate has provided a growing catalogue of significant heritage places throughout Australia. The register currently lists more than 13,000 places and has functioned as both a mechanism for heritage protection and a centralised inMAIN COMMITTEE formation repository for Australian heritage. In 2007, the Howard government effectively abolished the Register of the National Estate. The register is now closed to new listings and, in five years, it will fully expire, with listings reverting to various state and territory mechanisms. While there have been many other heritage registers developed following the Register of the National Estate, the expiry of the Register of the National Estate will diminish the level of protection for many significant Australian places. The expiry of the register also signals a loss of the Australian public’s foremost heritage information resource. In short, there is no substitute for the register as a catalogue of the places which we, as a nation, regard as significant. The Howard government has much to take us backward and very little to take us forward in terms of heritage protection, conservation and promotion. After four years of operation, the National Heritage List is far shortMrs GashMr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask you to draw the relevance between what the shadow minister is talking about and the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Amendment Bill 2007. tional heritage significance, and they fall within the province of this particular trust and, as a consequence, I think these remarks are in order. member for Kingsford Smith started, he spoke directly to the bill in terms of what it is about and what the government has achieved in relation to it, and then he broadened the argument to the failings of the government. I believe it is not beyond the wit of the member for Kingsford Smith to draw the elements of his argument back to the bill itself. opposite and also for you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is very clear that those issues that were addressed in terms of the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust itself, which is the matter for consideration here, are matters of national heritage significance. It is that question and also the government’s record that I am addressing here. If the government does not want to have debate and reflections made on its record here in the House, then I allow others to make a judgement about that. In the meantime, I propose to consider it. Incredibly, Australia’s World Heritage areas were only added to the National Heritage List in May 2007. These additions were made without ceremony and reflect government embarrassment over its failure to include those places on the list at an earlier stage. On the flip side of heritage inaction, we have witnessed the politicisation of heritage listing processes. You can see it nowhere clearer than in the government’s approach to ANZAC Cove. In 2003, the Prime Minister promised permanent protectionmember for Kingsford Smith on all sorts of matters. He has opportunities with MPIs whenever he chooses. We are debating the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Amendment Bill 2007. He spoke for a few minutes about that and is now delivering a discursive address on matters of heritage, which have no connection with this bill at all; they are irrelevant to this bill. I am happy to engage with him on another occasion, but he must address the bill. MAIN COMMITTEE",213,Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Amendment Bill 2007

Fair go! Wentworth and the member for Gilmore. The member for Kingsford-Smith was making a point that he was returning to. He thought the debate should be wider. I think we should be gracious enough to take that into account. politicisation have been expressed fairly strongly in this chamber. In any event, let me conclude by pointing out that Labor does support this amendment. Labor recognises the importance of identifying not only those places that fall within the remit of this legislation but also places that, more generally, have significant national heritage significance and that point attention to the government’s record of protection and identification of same. I will conclude by saying that Labor does support the bill and point out the story of the Howard government’s 11 years of neglect of our heritage. Heritage is an important component of what it means to be an Australian, and it is a matter that Labor will take very seriously should it prevail at the next election. pm)-The Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Amendment Bill 2007 facilitates the extension of the life of the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust from 19 September 2011 to 19 September 2032.
