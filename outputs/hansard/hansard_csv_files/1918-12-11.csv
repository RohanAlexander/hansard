An adequate consideration of the War Precautions Bill alone-to say nothing of the Estimates-woul d more than justify us in remaining here for a longer period than a week and one day, notwithstanding that we shall be called upon to sit all round the clock. Of course, I recognise the difficulties in which Ministers find themselves, and I specially sympathize with the position of the Acting Prinie Minister, who is doing more work than is any other Minister. Mr ""WATT -That is always the case. absolutely impossible, I repeat, for us to deal with all the matters which are listed for our consideration before the day upon which it is intended that Parliament shall rise amendment to the motion. doing that? The responsibility of saying how much time shall be accorded to the consideration of any measure that may be brought before us rests entirely with the Government. The Estimates, which were prepared while the war was in progress, provide for an expenditure of £S0,000,000 or £100,000,000, and we shall be expected to pass them after a few minutes' discussion, not when fifty or now, but probably when only a very few members are present, and when some of them are asleep. That is not the way in which we should transact the business of this country. Then, in connection with the Bill under which it is proposed to grant a pension to the Chief Justice of the High Court, we are invited to adopt a new procedure. I have nothing whatever to say against the distinguished occupant of this office. It is the principle of the measure with which I am concerned, and the fact that it will in the future be quoted as a precedent. We have been told that the Wartime Profits Tax Bill will be discussed chiefly by Corner Ministerialists,. and that the measure does not interest honourable members upon this side of the chamber. May I point out that it does interest us, and that, if a wrong principle be adopted in it, we shall be as much responsible as will honourable members opposite.

I know that, during the last Parliament, I secured the adjournment of the debate upon three such motions. But surely a similar fate is not going to befall the Ministerial statement which was made last night. I have no desire to say one word which will prejudge, or prejudice anybody in connection with its subject-matter. But the statement is of too serious a character to permit of its consideration being deferred for two or three months. It would be far better for the Government to candidly confess that there is not sufficient time before we rise to deal with the measures with which they desire us to deal, and to say that, in the circumstances, and having regard to the importance of the issues which confront us, it is their intention to call Parmotion:-""And shall adjourn not later than liament together early next year. My recollection is that we met either on the 9th or 16th January this year. Yesterday I urged Ministers to agree to the postponement of the consideration of the War Precautions Bill. There is no real urgency about that measure. The Act which it seeks to extend is already in operation, and will continue in operation until peace is declared. The Bill may very well, therefore, be allowed to stand. over until next year.

The houorable member for Henty( Mr Boyd) has asked me whether I have ever seen a different condition of things at the end of a session. In reply, I challenge him to point to any occasion upon which a Government has proposed to deal with so much business in the brief space of one week.

CATTS -We are asked to sit upon extra days, and if we adjourn at 11 p.m. each sitting will then have lasted twelve hours. That, I submit, is long enough even for the youngest member of this House, l t must be recollected that any Bill submitted by the Government to Parliament has previously been considered by Ministers, and that there is no obligation on them to remain here and watch its progress through the Chamber. They may arrange to take turns in going home at night. There are a large number of Ministers, and they may agree to relieve each other. They can have sleeping berths made up in different parts of the building, and thus they may secure needful rest. But the obligation rests upon the members of a small Opposition,who desire to see that the basic principles of measures are just, to' remain here, alevt and watchful, during the whole of the sitting hours of the House: It is quite impossible for any honourable member to sit here for twelve hours and do justice to the subjects that come up for discussion.

80,Mr Watt,"Parliamen t will not tie itmorning, but it is the Government who are to decide when it shall adjourn. The Acting Prime Minister has hinted that there will be no all-night sittings, but I have been here long enough to know what happens during the weeks preceding Christmas. We shall certainly have all-night sittings, and if the Government propose that proceedings shall commence each morning, at 11 o'clock and that there shall be all-night likely to deal with all the measures before sittings, they might just as well move to have the whole of the business put through on the closure at one sitting as expect that the matters brought forward will be properly discussed. It will be impossible to give them proper consideration. I notice that more business has been added to the notice-paper. The War Precautions Bill should stand over. The Act it seeks to extend will not cease to operate before the House meets again, so that there is no need for pushing it through before Christmas. Also, there is nothing urgent about the Chief Justice's Pension BUI. From what I hear of the injustice brought about in certain exceptional cases by the war-time profits tax, I think that the Bill dealing with that matter is one upon which honourable members should devote a certain amount of time in order to lay down more equitable principles upon which the tax should operate, and the question of administration mentioned yesterday is an urgent matter that should be disposed of; but', with the exception of the Estimates and the Wartime Profits Tax Assessment Bill, there is nothing on the business-paper which could not just as well be dealt with three months hence as in the coming week. The matters I have mentioned are all that we should be asked to consider before Christmas. The Estimates should certainly be given full consideration. The practice of rushing money through Parliament at the rate of millions a minute should cease. There can be no proper oversight of public expenditure when the Estimates are rushed through as continually occurs. It is a wonder to me that graver scandals have not arisen, because lack of supervision in regard to the, expenditure of enormous sums of public money must create the very circumstances which lead to such undesirable happenings in public life. I ask members of the Government party to join us in carrying this amendment.

I am not unmindful that the lion qr able member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster), and many other honourable members, have expressed solicitude in regard to the public expenditure of the country. But what I wish to challenge is the implication in the honourable member's remarks that the Government are recreant to their responsibilities concerning the financial expenditure of the country at this time. I do not take from the honourable member, or from any of his friends on this or the other side of the House, one word of credit for their own feelings and beliefs; nor for a desire to do ample justice to the interests and the views of their constituents. But, if there comes from that kind of remark a suggestion that the Government are blind to that phase of their duty anything to. justify that. that then the Government would not be justified in receiving such scathing strictures in silence.

I repeat, without hestitation, that no Treasurer of any Government has done as much in the direction of economy as I have been able to do; and if my honourable friend desires to put the microscope on that statement he may visit the Treasury. I invite him to do so, and there he may see what has been done to reduce expenditure at this time.

I also appreciate the fact that as Treasurer he has made some very honest endeavours to reduce expenditure, and I can conceive that, in many instances, he has used the meat-axe in order to lop off big lumps of expenditure that otherwise would have been incurred. But acknowledgment of those services is no justification for the House surrendering its right to review the whole of the public expenditure. Surely no honourable member can say, having regard to the developments that have taken place in the waf situation, that the last word has been said in regard to the finances of the country and the reduction of proposed expenditure.

The House has been most patient with the Government in connection with its taxation proposals. We have passed Bills imposing additional taxation to the extent of millions of pounds, in order to carry on the Avar, to bring our soldiers back from other parts of the world, to repatriate them, and to provide war pensions.

There is, therefore, absolutely no necessity for the suspension of the standing order in question. Standing Orders are framed to protect the rights and privileges of members, but members do not appear to rise to the necessity of safeguarding their rights by upholding the Standing Orders.

They have cut down, or postponed, as they call it , a tremendoui amount of proposed expenditure in connection with the Arsenal and the Naval Bases. ' They have also cut down expenditure at the Federal Capital to such an extent that it has become a scandal, because works which have been carried out there are falling into disrepair, so that money already expended will be wasted. A r e honourable members satisfied with this brand of economy ? Are there not avenues of employment in which the people would be glad to have money expended ? It is up to the Government to do something. The War Precautions Act was intended for a time of war, and not a time of [335]2 peace. I doubt very much whether its continuance in times of peace will be constitutional. The RiotA c t has been read in this country during times of great vioestablishment, for the time being, of martial law. And that is what the War Precautions Act means. It is martial law. We agreed to it because we were then at war, and because legislation could not have been administered properly without it. But are we going to perpetuate it? That is the proposal of the Government. Ministers tell us that, as the Act w ill exclaimed, it is necessary to provide for the continuance of its operation, so that they may carry out contracts that have been entered into; continue the moratorium, and do other things that have to be done. Suppose we do what they ask. Peace is uot to be thought of before March, and probably w ill not be ratified unti l June. Cannot the Government introduce before June legislation to supersede the ""War Precautions Act? In my opinion, they might well introduce such legislation now. Tho honourable member for Dampier( Mr. Gregory) has made an acceptable suggestion in proposing to extend the operation of the War Precautions Act to the end of June or July, or the date of the declaration of peace, whichever may be the later date, but the Government w ill not accept that suggestion. sufficient breathing space. six months we can.not pass the legislation that is needed, we are incapable, and should be sent to the country.

155,Mr Higgs (Capricornia) [2.30],"In-that preamble the Government have power to make all the necessary regulations and orders to give them complete and absolute power during war time in regard to everything necessary for the defence of the Commonwealth, nnd it was the feeling of all of us who voted for the measure when it was brought before the House of Representatives, on the 28th October, 1914, that the Government in tirr.e of war must have absolute power that induced us to consent, with very little opposition, to the passing of the Bill' within the space, I suppose, of about twenty-four hours. hours. ing at the time, as may be-seen on page. 374 of Hansard of 28th October, 1914. My words were1 regret that it appears to be necessary to pass this B ill through all its stages in one day. If those who now, parrot-like; keep repeating that the War Precautions Act was passed by the Labour party would only read the speeches of those who spoke adversely at that time, they would see that the only fear in our minds was, -not that an injury might be done to the Australian citizens, but that possibly injustice might be done to those aliens whom'we had invited to come to Australia and make their homes among us. The whole trend of my remarks on the subject was in that direction. I wanted to know from the then Prime Minister( Mr the present time because hostilities have Fisher) and the then Attorney-General( Mr Hughes) whether any injustice would be done to naturalized aliens, not « by any member of the Government, but by the officers who had to administer the Act. might be tyrannical towards the aliens who had come to Australia and made their homes here We never dreamt for a moment that the head of the Government would run amuck as Mr Hughes afterwards did. Mr Fisher had been Prime Minister for years, and not only his party, but Australia as a whole, has a great deal of confidence in his common sense, but when he retired, and Mr do in this House will give them those Hughes took his place, things were done which no one can defend. Nevertheless, at that time Mr Hughes gave his pledge. According to Hansard, page 378; of the 28th October, 1914, he saidI n reply to the honourable member for. Angas, I said, in effect, that this clause was quite aseparate and distinct B ill , and gave authority to the Government to make regulations clothing the Naval or Military Board, or any member of tlie Forces, with certain powers. The authority conferred on the Government is tremendous, and the responsibility is equally great; but circmnstances demand that there -should be this power. It was on account of his repeated asseverations that the War Precautions Act would not be abused that we passed the Bill, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, within a period of two hours. Section2 of the Act says-^ 1. This Act sliall continue in operation during the ^continuance of the present state of war, and no longer. 2. For the purposes of this Act the present state of war means the period from the 4th day of August, 1014, at the hour of 11 o'clock post meridian, reckoned according to Greenwich standard time, until the issue of a proclamation by the Governor General that the Avar between His Majesty the King and the German Emperor, and between His Majesty the King and the Emperor of Austria, King of Hungary, has ceased. Those words are quite clear; there is nothing ambiguous about them; the state of war continues from the 4th day of August, 1914, until the declaration of peace; and during this period the War Precautions Act remains in force. . The suggestion of the Government is that they require the powers given by the Act at ceased and an armistice has been signed. The general public is under the impression that the war is at an end. It may be, but, technically and legally, the war will not be at an end until the declaration We thought it possible -that they of peace. I submit respectfully, and, speaking as a layman, that the Gen vernment already have all the powers tbey ' require under the War Precautions Act. that on the declaration of peace all those powers which stand outside section 51 of the Constitution, and the thirty-nine articles enumerated therein, will fall away from them automatically, and that nothing we can powers for a moment longer.

In 1916 tliere was a doubt as to whether the Commonwealth Government had power to fix the price of sugar or the price of bread. I was Treasurer at the time, and, having taken over the control of sugar fro m the Prime Minister( Mr For loan oft loses both itself and f r i e n d ; Hughes), I was confronted by some shopkeepers, who said that they declined to sell sugar at 3£d. per lb. I consulted the Crown Law officers as to whether the Commonwealth Government had the right to fix the price of sugar, andthey said that, in their opinion, we did not possess that power; but I paid no attention to their opinion, and the Government, at my request, issued a regulation fixing the price of sugar. We were supported in the view that the Commonwealth had the power to fix the price of sugar, and make it an offence for any one to refuse to carry oufc our order, by a decision of the High Court to this effect: that Government in war time were prepared to say that any action on their part was necessary for the defence of the realm, the H i gh Court would hesitate before declaring it unconstitutional. The Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) has indulged in a number' of alarmist phrases quite'in keeping with the methods of exaggeration adopted by the Prime a continuance of the large powers which have been grossly abused by certain Ministers, and he selected the moratorium, powers as those which were most necessary for the purpose of saving the Commonwealth from the dreadf u l disaster which would ensue from a.financial panic,if mortgagees sought to foreclose on mortgagors. of the untold millions that were involved. put into a very difficult position, because outside their charters they had advanced moneys to their employees to subscribe *to war loans. of his trouble, I may point out that the Commonwealth already has the power, under the Constitution, to deal with banking, and that if it is desirable that a Bill should be passed authorizing bankers to go outside their present charters to any extent, we have the power to pass such a measure. Of course, the general public has every sympathy with the man who borrows money. Most people are to be classed amongst those unfortunates who 1 ignore Shakespeare's adviceNeither a borrower, nor a lender' be : And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. Naturally, there is a great deal of sympathy for the man who borrows,and very little for the person who lends, money. However, the moratorium powers have been abused. They have been abused by fche Prime Minister( Mr Hughes). Whoever heard of a more dreadful thing than the Prime Minister's action in availing himself of the moratorium in order to avoid payment of his just debts to the lady from whom he had bought his house? Whoever heard of the moratorium being amended so that the mortgagee would be required to prove that the mortgagor had if the Commonwealth sufficient means to pay? That was done by the Goveniment to allow the mortgagor to escape his obligations and in order to place upon the mortgagee the responsibility of proving that borrowers had the money to pay."" It was not necessary for the mortgagor to prove that ' he could not pay. I submit that the Government have no power to deal with this matter after the conclusion of peace; but assuming that they have the power, they ought to compel those who have borrowed money to go into Court and prove that they are not able to pay their just debts, that an extension of time ought to be allowed, and that.they ought to be permitted to continue the mortgage at the rate of interest they have been paying.

In that direction the Government had an opportunity to exercise some of their vast powers in a just and generous way. I contend that the Government have no power to engage in trade and commerce, to pass a general-'company law, to create a Wool Pool or a Wheat Pool, or to deal with any of the country's products after the declaration of peace. Buti f they are sincere and earnest in their proposal to protect the producers, distributors, and consumers, they ought to call immediately a meeting of"" the State Premiers, place before them the position outlined by the Acting Prime Minister, and invite them to at once introduce legislation in their own Parliaments to take over from the Commonwealth ""those unconstitutional powers which the Federal authority has exercised during the war. If any State Government or Parliament refused to do that, at their door would lie the responsibility. With regard to the moratorium, the Acting Attorney-General is probably aware that at a very early period after the commencement of the war the South Australian Parliament made preparations to give relief in hard cases like those referred to by the honourable member, for prevent great injustice being done by the foreclosure of mortgages. Australian Parliament passed an Act, which was assented to on the 24th September, 1914, entitled "" An Act to postpone the obligation to make certain payments,"" and is cited as "" The Mortgages and Purchases Postponement Act 1914."" There are sections in that measure providing for the postponement of the due date of payments secured by mortgage and of purchase money, and section 6 gives the Governor power to, by. proclamation, prolong or further prolong the periods of postponement for a specified period. In order to deal with vided that a Judge should hear complaints, and in regard to the rates of interest, sub-section 2 of section 7 readsThe rateof the interest payable at any t me by virtue of this seel ion shall, unless the rate thereof is hereafter agreed upon by the parties before such interest falls due, beMr Higgs. The lender and borrower could meet before the interest fell due and decide what rate of interest should be paid; but if they failed to do that, the interest was to be(a) Five and a half per centum per annum, or (6) the rate accruing on the postponed sum on the date when such sum would have been payable if this Act had not been passed, whichever is the higher rate : Provided that if the rate of interest payable uncler any mortgage or agreement is tliereby fixed by reference to rates current, in the cage of some specified class of transactions, at the times when the sums of interest respectively fall due or are paid (as the case may be), the rates payn. le 1 by virtue of this section shall, at. the option of the mortgagee or vendor, be as so fixed or as fixed by this section. That Act contains provision for dealing with all cases that are affected"" by the moratorium regulations made by the Commonwealth Government. If the South Australian Parliament was prepared to take this step a month after the war started, why cannot every State Parliament be asked to carry on the moratorium after the declaration of peace in respect to all cases of hardship? We are wasting the time of the Commonwealth in discussing this Bill. The Government, will not have a leg to stand on after the declaration of peace, and inevitably, if some State Government does not fe*el called upon to challenge the Commonwealth's attempts to invade the The South sovereign rights of the States, some private persons or companies will d'o so, and the High Court, which took such a reasonable and common-sense view of the National Government's autliority in wartime-decidin g fchafc fche Commonwealth must have absolute and complete power, otherwise it would be hampered in its conduct offchewar-wil l assuredly declare that there will be no occasion after the declaration of peace for the Conunonwealth to assume the functions which the States themselves ought to assume, and which, according to the Constitution, they of injustice it was proonly can assume.

Sir Edward Mitchell; KC; was most emphatic against conceding to the the large powers that were being sought,, and how those gentlemen and the members of the present Government can now ask the Federal Parliament to take over powers which in 1911, and later, they denied the wisdom of the Commonwealth is beyond my comprehension.

162,Mr Fowler (Perth) [ 3 . 1 ],"I am9056 urgent one. The Government seem to assume that all these precautions will immediately come to an end, and that, therefore, a period of six months of preparation is necessary before we can revert to normal conditions. To my mind, it is unlikely that peace will be declared for several months to come. I am inclined to think that the necessity for the continuance of this measure will disappear before peace is declared. Sof a r as I am able to judge the situation inEurope, there will be a very considerable interval before the Allies are satisfied that it will be safe for them to revert to a condition which would in any way enable Germany to resume warfare. Germany is still obviously unrepentant. She is still prepared to throw obstacles in the way of an early settlement; still desirous of throwing the apple of discord into the camp of the Allies, go that perhaps before we have arrived at a peace settlement, there may be a separation of the views of the Allies for the benefit of Germany. For these and other reasons I feel sure that peace will not be declared for many months, and that the Government, therefore, have shown an apprehension that is not at all justifiable in regard to a period of confusion occurring by reason of the sudden discontinuance of our war precautions. We are all agreed that the state of affairs that has existed under the War Precautions Act should not continue a day longer than is absolutely. With very few exceptions, we all agreed that, in view of the war and the gravity of the situation, the Government be given these unexampled powers. we were so far removed from the theatre of war that our conditions were different, and likely to remain different, from those of countries in the very thick of the conflict, we might very well have hesitated to give all these enormous powers. liament, Government. as a whole have also loyally the conditions under the War tions Act, and have lived under in a way that is entirely creditable to the community. that irritation has been created by the operation of the Act. Some of the reguMr Fowler. War Precautions [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill. lations framed under it were undoubtedly beneficial and necessary; others cannot have that justification. Some of them were positively mischievous. And yet we are asked to allow all these regulations which have been in operation during the war to continue for a quite unnecessarily long period. We have handed over to a number of organizations of an irresponsible character the control of the affairs of the country. Parliament has set aside its functions of criticism and watchfulness, and Ministerialists, at all events, have given the Government practically a free hand. Thus the Government, in carrying out the aims and objects they nave had in view, have been in a position of almost unexampled freedom and irresponsibility. Having regar'd to the responsibility that . we owe to the country and to our constituents, we.cannot, however, allow such an abnormal state of affairs to continue indefinitely. We must have good and substantial reasons for the continuance of the War Precautions Act. I listened to the very powerful and persuasive speech made last week by the Acting Prime Minister( MrW a t t ) , in which he attempted<to j u s t if y the introduction of this measure. I am not at all satisfied that the case, even as put by h i m, was such as to entitle the House to pass this B ill without very serious consideration and criticism. The honourable gentleman failed to make good in several parts of his speech. In one. necessary. or two respects I think he overreached himself, and pictured a condition of affairs which was due more to his highly should imaginative powers than to any actual Since foundation in fact. While1 do not wish to discuss the proposition at any great length, I agree w it h a good deal of the speech just made by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr. ParHiggs), in which he reminded the Governhowever, was loyal to the ment that the State Parliaments and GoThe people of Australia vernments have certain responsibilities in accepted respect of matters that were necessarily « Precautaken over by the Commonwealth Governthem ment during the continuance, of the war. He reminded the House that the States There is no doubt, however, might reasonably be expected to supplement these special war measures of ours with such legislation as they might think necessary now that the war has come to an end. various States differ materially, it would be perhaps much better in the interests of all concerned if they were given an opportunity to legislate in regard to matters that we propose to deal with by this B ill , rather than that we should continue to lump them together in the necessarily promiscuous manner of Commonwealth legislation of this kind. To one or two of the matters discussed by the Acting Prime Minister State legislation could not very well apply. . The control of shipping is one of these. I am not sure that the ship-owners of Australia would not be prepared to make a satisfactory arrangement with the Government, even if this law were allowed to lapse. such an arrangement would be f a r more satisfactory than the continuance of the present rigid regulations exercised by a Board that has shown a good deal of judgment and ability in carrying out its work,, but which necessarily restricts the freedom of the shipping organizations, and, therefore, to some extent, their u t i l it y as public carriers. Let us also take the question of the sugar control. The Acting Prime Minister reminded us* that it necessarily had to be carefully considered. The whole question, to my mind, requires immediate investigation. In view of the very unsatisfactory state of the sugar position, whether as it affects growers, manufacturers, traders, or consumers, I would suggest that it is about time that a Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the whole subject. The recess might very, well be employed by a Commission that would give us some information as regards those features of the question to which I have just referred. Certainly the position can no longer be endured by Australia as a whole. The difficulties in the way of production seem to be increasing rather than diminishing. The cost of carrying on the sugar industry has been a heavy handicap on the people of Australia, and if we are not going to come down to a thoroughly business-like level with respect to the whole issue, then I see nothing but disaster ahead for the sugar industry as a Seeing that the conditions in the whole. I do not want that to happen, but if light were thrown on the question in the way I have suggested it might possibly mean a. new lease of life for the industry, which seems to be limping along very badly. I do not think that the continuance of the War Precautions Act will benefit the community so far as price fixing is concerned. Nothing done under that Act has been more absurd or ineffective. Comparatively few articles have been subject to the operation of the measure in regard to the fixing of tlieir prices, the great bulk of the commodities in daily requirement by the public having been left to the unfortunate and unconscionable effects of the law of supply and demand. Time and again there has been mention in this Chamber of commodities whose prices have become altogether preposterous, and still no action has been taken in regard to them. 'Speakingf or the State of Western Australia, I say, without hesitation, that the community there has been put to a grave disadvantage by the price fixing operations of the Government, which, in some instances, increased instead of decreased prices to the consumer. The price of galvanized iron jumped f r om £12 per ton to nearly £100 per ton, and yet no action was taken by the Government. Under those circumstances, what can we conclude about the efficiency of the officials responsible for the fixing of prices, or the earnestness of the Government about preventing the exploitation of the community? In my opinion, the whole system is absolutely wrong. Instead of putting upon the consumer the'onus of showing that prices have been unfairly increased.,it should have been for the seller to j u s t if y the increase. H a d a regulation been issued prohibiting a seller from increasing the price of an article beyond 10 per cent, on its ordinary selling price, unless it could be shown that there was need for a still further increase, and imposing salutary sentences on all who acted contrary to the law, the publie would have been better protected than by the price fixing methods of the Goverument.",42,Chapman No One Standing Up For The Primary Producers In

164,Mr Fowler,"Then I suggest thatThere are, of course, matters in regard to which the continuance of the conditions created under the War Precautious Act is necessary. I agree that the Wheat and Wool Pools should continue. They are, however, likely to continue without interference under the law as it stands at present. The present indefinite position of the relations of the belligerents that are parties to the armistice is likely to last for another six months, and, as it was to be gathered from the speeches in favour of the measure, that that is all the time the Government requires, I see no necessity for the Bill. There is certainly no justification for the extension of the operation of the Act to preserve the censorship. The Acting Prime Minister, to some extent, overreached himself, and created a distinctly unfortunate impression, by what he said on this subject. . He spoke of the need of preventing irresponsible and objectionable utterances in certain quarters that might cause offence to our Allies. His remarks have, I think, created the impression that there is in Australia a considerable body of opinion which is hostile in some regards to some of our Allies, or, at least, to some of their interests. As a matter of fact, that is not so. The objectionable utterances and writings that might be made public if the pregent precautionary measures were abolished are mere insignificant bubbles on the stream of Australian political opinion. To give them prominence by continuing the censorship makes them appear more influential than they .are. The censorship has been abolished as between the United Europei n all matters affecting the war. This Government, I understand, proposes to do something in that direction. I do not know what has been done, but, at least, as much should be done here as has been done in other parts of the world. The loyal way in which the press of Australia observed the injunction not to publish matter that might be prejudicial to the public interest in the conduct of the war, not only in letter, but in spirit, merits recognition, and it.should, at the earliest moment, be given the liberty .which it enjoys under the common law of Afr. Fowler. expressing its views without let or hindrance. The newspapers of the Oommonwealth undoubtedly perform a very important function in connection with the Government of the country, and I am desirous of seeing them restored to their former position. I have the misfortune to be criticised occasionally, just as the Government is criticised, but that is part of the life of a politician and of a Government, and on the whole we have no reason to fear the utterances of our newspapers. As for the one or two organs which represent the views of the extremists of the Yarra Bank, they should be given an opportunity to let off as much steam as they can. honourable member used to do when he was on the Yarra Bank: Yarra Bank in my life. HadI done so, I should probably have told my audiences a few home truths that might not be palatable to such as the honourable member. The safety of the community is not heing served by repressing these individuals. If we make martyrs of them, we strengthen their cause. Without a grievance, they are powerless, but with a grievance, especially one which appears legitimate, their propaganda thrives. To my mind, the disloyal elements, in Australia are insignificant, but whatever be -their strength, we shall not do well by stuffing a War Precautions Act into the safety valve-. Let persons talk and write as they will, subject to the common law of the realm.. As the bulk of our newspapers and magazines solidly support law States of America and and order, the disloyal elements in the community can be entirely ignored. The suggestion that their utterances have any effect upon our Allies is too laughable to consider for a moment. Views such as they express were being published before the war, and will continue .to find publication after the war, but no person inside or outside Australia takes notice of them, except when provocation is given -to crime or breaches of the ordinary law, and that the ordinary law can deal with effectively. "" The question to .be considered in connection with the Government's proposal is:",44,Chapman No One Standing Up For The Primary Producers In
165,Mr Bkennan,That is what the,45,Chapman No One Standing Up For The Primary Producers In
166,Mr Fowler,"I never spoke on thehow long will it be before we can return to normal conditions? Peace is not likely to be formally declared for many months to come, and, therefore, the measure under discussion is unnecessary. Should peace be declared as suddenly as the armistice-came about, I would agree to the Government being given a little time in which to consider the position. But I am not sure that it would be wise to mention any specific period at which the Act must cease. Under the amendment of the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory), it would cease in June, or at the declaration of peace, whichever was the later date. It is just possible, however, that the end of June might mean a longer period than we should feel inclined to grant under certain circumstances. We might have a dissolution; and I must confess that the prospect of a general electionunder the Wa r Precautions Act is not one that I can regard with very much satisfaction, for I do not think it would be at all desirable. We are entitled, in my opinion, to some more specific indication by the Government as to what is really their mind with regard to the continuance of the Act. If peace conditions are not formally signed until six months hence, is the Government justified in asking for another six months' extension of the Act? I do not think so. I also wish the Government to seriously consider whether the censorship should not be altogether abolished. matters I put forward very earnestly, because I feel they are the true, salient features of the whole position. can get no explanation from the Government of a satisfactory nature, I shall certainly v o t e ' for the proposed amendment. not desire to delay the House long, but, undoubtedly, this measure is one of the most important that has ever had to be considered, and it is only righ t that honourable members should define their position in regard to it . There has been, and is, a great deal of opposition in the country to the War Precautions regulations being continued in any shape or form, now that we are in the fortunate position of having the armistice signed; and t h a t opposition appears to centre around two sides of the operation of the regulations. One side is their operation,, in so far as restraint is put on the commercial activities of merchants and othersengaged in business in this country; and the other relates to the question of free speech and the curbing of the utterances of certain people Dealing first with the side as it affects business, it appears to me that the commercial community is being a little maligned and made to appear as taking up an extremely unreasonable -attitude. I have had the opportunity of talking to a good number of commercial men, and while they, like, It h in k the f most of us, are opposed to the regulations which interfere with the ordinary flow . of commerce, they recognise that, after having carried on the affairs of the country in a certain way for four years, we cannot at once revert to the position we were in before hostilities broke out. The average commercial man is, I -think, perfectly prepared to bepatient, provided he has some reasonable certainty that the position is going to be cleared up, and that we are not indefinitely to be controlled by war-time regulations. For my own part;-and I think it is the view of most with any knowledge of busi. nessI would prefer to see a B i ll brought in with a schedule attached, indicating exactly the activities over which the Government think it is essential to keep some control. But I remind honourable members that we have been in this war These two and fighting hard right up to the last few weeks; and the armistice has come on us rather suddenly. It is impossible, in the If we course of a week or two, to give considerationto every one of these three volumes of regulations that have been referred to, and determine which'can be dropped and which must be retained. I do The Government have not had an opportunity to consider that matter, but when they have,' and they bring down a proposal, it should be clear and definite. I have some sympathy with the Government in the position in which they find themselves; but may I suggest that some people in this country do not altogether, believe in politicians or in Governments, and the opinion has been very freely expressed that, given another six months of the operation of the War Precautions Act, the Government, at the end of that period, will blandly express their regret",45,Chapman No One Standing Up For The Primary Producers In
167,Mr Brtjce (Flinders) [ 3 . 3 3 ],"that they have not had an opportunity to consider which of the regulations should be abolished. the assurance given by the Leader of the Government. that I am only informing the House of what various people in the commercial community tliink and say. honourable member is not fair, but that those outside are not. able gentleman will find those outside extraordinarily "" unfair"" frtfm. his point of view, and I am warning him of what they are saying. I urge, the Government to give some indication to the people that they are getting on seriously with their work-that they arc shedding their powers under' these regulations as quickly as they possibly can. As one of the commercial community, I realize that it is a difficult job to drop those powers at once, but there is going to be a very determined opposition if the commercial community find that the Government, if this extension be granted, are not seriously seeking to get rid of the restricting regulations and give the enterprise and ability of thc commercial community a fair chance to show what it can do. Having expressed that view, it certainly appears to me that next July would give to the Government reasonable and ample time in which to think over the matter and get out a schedule of what powers must be retained. I should be very pleased if the Government would accept that amendment, but whether they do so or not, I shall be compelled to support it. If matters are not straightened up by then a Bill could be brought down to extend some of the necessary powers, and that might contain a schedule of those to be retained. But there is another side-the censorship side. We are all, I think, opposed to> the censorship; but my friends opposite had better hear all I have to say on this point before they cheer. So far as I understand it, the censorship has two sides to it. There is the one side that has been referred to, the political censorship, to which I am bitterly opposed, and will do anything I can to fight. We have, however, an assurance from the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) that the censorship is not to be used politically. Although most honourable members accept that assurance, some have a wavering doubt, owing to the experience they allege they have had. I do not know whether they are justified in that experience or not; but"" I think they may take considerable comfort unto themselves, because we have a personal assurance from the Government, and more. We know that the acting head of the Government ( Mr Watt) is a shrewd man, and I think his wisdom would stop short of anything in the way of a political censorship now that the war is over, for he knows that it would cause such an outcry in the country that no Government could live under it. At the same time, I do not wish to be understood as in any way suggesting that I do not absolutely accept the assurance that has been, given. The censorship has another form, and though I should like to. see this form abolished, I am not prepared to see it go at present. We must, I think, retain some power in this country to stop certain persons, and certain factions, from making wild statements that are prejudicial to the interests of the community. Unless some power is retained for this purpose we may have considerable trouble. I entirely agree with the view taken by many people that the best way to stop such trouble is to do what has always been done in British communities, and provide a safety valve in the absolute freedom of press and platform. This freedom has worked well in British history, but I remind honourable members that the reason it has worked so well is that we have ever had a wonderfully sane, well-balanced nation, the good sense of which has always seen to it that extremists do not do very much harm. I suggest, however, that. in this community at present we are not quite in that position. There are still absent more than 200,000 of our best and sanest citizens-the soldiers who have been'fighting.

But I differ from h i m on some points, particularly in regard"" to the statement that it is not possible to fix a date when the Act should definitely cease. The very fact that we cannot anticipate ""the exact date of the declaration of peace is an additional reason why we should fix a date for the termination of the Act. As was pointed out Perth( Mr Fowler) and other honourable members, the final signing of the peace contract may be deferred for 'twelve months, or it may take place at the end of January. It is necessary that the Government should have some extension of their powers, so that the A ct may not stop suddenly at an early date, but the Government should say, "" Before six months we shall be able to come to the House with a f u l l knowledge of the powers that we shall require to operate after the declaration of peace, and we shall ask Parliament to give us by legislation definite powers in respect of those matters and no others."" The blank cheque which the Government are seeking is too much to ask from this House, and I Minister and the Ministeri n charge of the B ill should consider whether they cannot agree to the .desire of members on this side by fixing an early date upon which the War Precautions Act shall terminate, and, before that date, approaching Parliament for any extension of power which is necessary in respect of certain specified matters. adopt that course, I feel sure that the Bouse w ill be prepared to give them the power they need. Another Teason why the date of the termination of the Act should be specified was given by the Acting Attorney-General( Mr Groom) when he expressed some doubt as to whether, when the war ends, the Government's operations under the War Precautions Act will be legal. in my mind and in the minds of other honourable members. constitutional power to do these things, and we have received advice to that effectthat he called into consultation some of the best legal minds in the Commonwealth, in order that he might be advised as to what powers he had.

Strange to say, although the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) convinced me by his argument on certain suggest that the Acting Prime subjects, he failed to convince me in respect of those matters to which, I think, he attached the most i m portance. I refer to the finance regulations ancl powers. I .may be considered egotistical in challenging the view of a gentleman of the standing of the Treasurer, who, no doubt, is supported by the opinions of the big financial experts in If they w ill the Commonwealth. But I am emboldened to do so by the knowledge that, of all experts throughout the world, the financial experts have been proved to have been most wrong in their conclusions throughout the war. For instance, I do not see that the flotation of war loans would be helped by a general tightening up of the financial-provisions which curtail investment in new companies and industries. On the contrary, I believe that the war loans would be helped if all those I did not say that. restrictions were withdrawn.

We are actually in a state of peace now, and the Government tell us that they intend to remove without delay as many of the regulations as possible.

I have heard many people say that the Act is necessary to prevent the flying of the red flag. One would imagine that that flag had only been heard of in Australia within the last few months. As a matter of fact, in 1904, I carried the red flag into a country electorate and won the seat. I agree with the honourable member for Maranoa that one could not wish to live under a better flag than the Union Jack. To ine it is everything. I recognise that we have the freest of Constitutions; but if any party desires to fly a political flag it should be permitted to do so. I would not bother about tbe red flag; but if others wish to fly it they should be allowed to do so. To many it is more than a sentiment; it is a. religion. It stands, not only for the working classes by continuing unnecessary restrictions. of Australia, but for the workers all over the world, and if they desire to fly it they should not be hindered. Acting Prime Minister showed in the very fine letter that he wrote to the Trades Hall that he knows what the red flag stands for. It does not, as some people imagine, stand for a bloody revolution, but it stands for a revolution in thought, for an alteration of our economic conditions. It is worshipped by a number of our people as a sign of the time to come when the working classes will be the rulers of the world. I believe that time to be not far distant. The world to-day is in a state of chaos. many, Austria, Bulgaria, Servia, and even France, things are very disturbed, and in Great Britain trouble has been staved off only by broadening the franchise and giving constitutional opportunities for the redressing of grievances. In this country there should be no talk of revolution, because there is every opportunity for dealing with grievances constitutionally, I totally differ from the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Archibald) in regard to the statement that the people whose opinions are contrary to his should be prevented from talking. from talking, you give them an advertisement, make martyrs of them, and stimulate the growth of their cause. In that way you do more to help those who preach revolutionary methods and Industrial Workers of the ""World doctrines than they could do for themselves. You help, too, the growth of this party. Indeed, the Ministry has only to continue its present course of conduct for another twelve months to bring about a reversal of the present position of political parties. The military authorities have been allowed to become the administrators of the War Precautions Act. I would not trust them fco deal with any civil matter. Indeed, they are not too competent to deal with Defence matters administratively, as has been shown over and over again. It has been wrong to allow military men to act as censors, and to decide who should be prosecuted for some speech or other. I realize the difficulties of the Ministry, but I believe that more trouble will be created E hope that the Bill may be defeated. listening to the debate* this morning and this afternoon, I have 'become conscious of a certain suspension of animation in the Ministerial party, and of a feeling of wonder as to what developments are to come, while on the Opposition benches there is an air of expectancy, and the hope there that, whatever may come out of the situation, please Heaven, it may be to their advantage. As if to crystallize the position, the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), after' two or In Russia, Gerthree firm but temperate speeches had been delivered from this side of the Chamber, leapt to his feet, took his courage in both hands, and moved that the Bill be read this day six months. By doing this, the honourable member -hoped to secure for his party any advantage that might accrue from the fact' that it is strongly felt on both sides that the powers exercised under the War Precautions Act should be brought to an end as soon as can be done consistent with the public safety.

Therefore, for the purposes of the original ActI am bound to regard the war as at an end. refers to the Central Empiresi n the clearest terms, and speaks of powers and potentates that have ceased to be. refers to the Emperor of Austria and the Emperor of Germany, but it would be difficult for any one to give the address of these gentlemen at the present time.

I am dealing with this matter on the broadest lines. Honourable members will remember that very shortly after the Balkan Powers had given the old Turk the licking of his life, the quarrelling over the lion's pelt began, with the result that Bulgaria, which had taken a large share in the fighting, finally found herself in the humiliating position '. from which the Turk, owing to her action, had been able to partially liberate himself. ""When the' representatives . of the Allies meet in the Peace chamber, they w ill include the representatives of a number of associated peoples that have taken no extremely active part in the war, were responsible for no decisive action on the field, and were not sacrificed to the blood lust of Germany. It ia then that German and enemy influences w ill play their last card by endeavouring to ' create that friction which alone will allow Germany to escape payment, and her late rulers to It is true that we have not yet escape punishment for the crim'es ot the last four and a half years. I feel that from now on, so f a r as the domestic government of Australia might It is, however, be affected, the ""War Precautions Act should cease to operate. In a community with the British temperament, the. greatest element of Safety lies in freedom of speech. But whilst there should be absolute freedom of speech in regard to the solution of our local problems, we cannot be too much alive to the necessity of seeing that there shall be no misuse of our That Act platforms, and of our local quarrels, to create differences between the Allies, whose councils are to decide our future It. destiny. J n the press, and in public speeches, one learns of the operation of the War Precautions Act mostly in connection with the censoring of articles and speeches; but, in my, humble judgment, the newspapers, however many cablegrams for which they had paid may have been suppressed by the censors, have"" escaped more lightly under the War Precautions , Act than any other trade interest in the community. one section of the newspapers. upon debatable ground; I am dealing T h a t is the sort of with the subject broadly. The War Precautions A ct has operated along the whole gamut of Australian industry. It has been applied, sometimes, no doubt, with the wisest and most patriotic intentions, to the bafflement and discouragement of industry and enterprise. Sometimes this industry and enterprise was not consistent with the public welfare, though unobjectionable in the days before the war had altered our position in the world. Still, throughout Australia, industry has been fettered for the first time, and it has felt its fetters more keenly than the newspapers have felt theirs. It has been in articulate, and unable to voice its protest. The newspapers could bring to the public some slight knowledge of what they were suffering, but the private trader has had no outlet for his feelings. That state of things is dangerous, and should be ended as early as possible.

When I heard the speech, I became for a moment a Bolshevik. I could see only one end in view, andi that was the discouragement of these excellent gentlemen, who, however patriotically they may have carried out their work during the past four years, ought to be got r i d of as early as the public convenience will permit, which means a3 early as we can frame legislation to take the place of regulations. bound to say that the subsequent speech of the Acting Prime Minister struck me with very considerable force. He did not make any claim for those estimable .unofficial dictators, but said that we would be in a state of chaos if they were immediately removed. Knowing the Government and the administrators, I am quite satisfied . the honourable gentleman was speaking the truth. There is just one regard in which, I bhink, the Acting Prime Minister short of what reasonable men might desire. He did not, to my mind, -as clearly as he might the view which I and, I believe, a number of other honourable members hold-that fche ability of this Government quickly it can divest itself of these powers and the country of the Boards. a question of fixing some vague point of time, like the signing of peace between numerous contestants who were not, -perhaps, the original contestants; question of how quickly we can gefc rid of the regulations. the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) to ' be able to assure the House and the country that, so far as those business activities of Sir John Higgins and his collaborators are concerned, no fresh enterprises will be indulged in between now and the definite' conclusion of hostilities. Mr Kelly. But I ask myself whether, on aI was motion of this kind, this is the time to satisfy ourselves: I s this the time to do more than state one's position? Is this the time to demand pro-, mises or statements ? I think not. Holding the view I do, I think the right time to settle all these points is at the Committee stage of the B ill . I frankly confess to the Government that I shall want this extension of powers very rigidly hedged round when we get into Committee. I shall want a promise as to the non-extension of fche activities of those unofficial dictators, and promises as to the non-political use of the powers of the censorship, andi I shall want those promises in the black and white of the* B ill . But this motion does not represent the proper time. It would beu n f a i r to the Government But I am to hold them to the original Act, bringing' the powers to an absolute f u l l stop with ""peace."" There are many possibilities in Europe. I do not know h o w peace is to be signed between the original contestants and ourselves, for the Central Empires are in a thousand fragments. Of course, persons representing sections may meet at the Peace table, and bind themselves as representing former in-tegrants of the old Empires, severally and individually, to .the fulfilment of the contract. If they do that, peace may come fell almost instantly; and for that reason I feel that we ought to give the Governexpress ment some extension of the powers under the Act . I do not ask for this extension in justice to the Government, but mainly the real test of in justice to the country.

Half-a-dozen honourable members in the House voted against that exemption. Apparently^ the agent selling on commission is to be allowed, under this Bill, to escape taxation. It is quite possible that, after the war, the same principle as is embodied in this ""Bill may be continued in other legisis to shoot the profiteer. lation, and that will mean the penalizing of the manufacturer. I well remember the reasons for the introduction of the original .war-time profits tax. Similar imposts had been made in the United Kingdom, Canada, and New Zealand; although later the New Zealand tax was repealed. Having those precedents before us, and knowing that many persons in the community had made enormous profits out of the war, we felt that they should be called upon to make some contribution to the revenue beyond what could be obtained by the ordinary income tax. iron, for instance. vanized iron, soft goods, and.various other stocks. The Acting Minister for Customs( Mr Greene) told us that, soon after the armistice was signed, the price of galvanized iron dropped from £ SO to £50 per ton. According to the Treasurer, the war-time profits tax yielded, in 1915but to the middleman, whom the Trea16, only about £1,200,000, which means that the excess war profits made in Australia in that year did not exceed £2,500,000. No one can make me believe that the excess war-time profits were not greater than that. from' this tax will be larger. that the Treasurer will be collecting 75 per cent, instead of 50 per cent, of the excess profits. Moreover, the Taxation Commissioner is continually discovering people who, in the past, have managed to escape portion of the taxation they should pay. The Taxation Department is different from the Customs Department, which has been running so long that the officials know all the old tricks of the importers, and soon discover any new tricks which are devised in order to cheat the revenue. The Commissioner of Taxation is continually calling upon defaulters to pay taxation, and no doubt many persons who should have paid the war-time profits tax, and did not do so, will be rounded up and compelled to pay. out after the .profits; what we should do belongs to a party which, instead of shooting the profiteer, would feed him. member call a profiteer? an extortionate profit at the expense of the community. We know that persons who bought sheep and lambs at the time of the drought for l^d. per lb., and placed them iu cool storage, later compelled the people to pay 8d. and lOd. per lb. for. the same meat. 3d. per lb. mutton that cost them 6d. per lb. butcher is' charging me 10d. per lb. for mutton getting the advantage of that price. neither the producer nor thc consumer, surer will allow to escape from the operations of this tax. The men who are getting all the benefit of the high prices for meat are the commission agents who risk nothing, whose only capital outlay is in the purchase of pencils and pocket books, but who have raised their charges since the war started.",59,Assessment Bill Second Reading

I am glad that the Government propose to allow only 10 per cent, profit on new capital invested, particularly in view of the fact that in a Bill which has passed recently 15 per' cent, was the standard, rate of interest. It is also provided that the new capital shall be genuine, and that there shall be no allowance of 10 per cent, on a lot of watered stock. According to sworn evidence before the Inter-State Commission recently a brick company had an actual capital of only £100, but its declared capital was £50,000, and upon that sum dividends were paid. I am pleased that the Treasurer proposes to deal with this inflation of capital, and to try to keep the people moderately honest in the flotation of companies or the increase of capital. In respect of many of the alterations proposed by the Bill the Treasurer is pro1 ceeding upon right lines, but I hope we shall have an opportunity of amending the measure in the direction of placing commission agents in exactly the same position as the manufacturers. What is the use of having a war-time profits tax from which everybody is ^ exempted? I well remember the then honourable member for Flinders( Sir William Irvine) speaking from the Ministerial crossbenches upon the original War-time Profits Tax Bill, and saying that it did not honour the promise given to the people that .war-time profits would be taxed, that it would not catch the rich manufacturers, the shipping companies, or the chemical companies, and that it The natural laws are supposed might as well be thrown into the. waste paper basket.""

It would be difficult to find a better man for the posia splendid officer, and with three or four other public servants he stood out prominently for efficiency of service. Mr Ewing, the present Commissioner, is another. He will see that people liable for taxation pay; but if we so frame our . legislation that it is possible for any rich, company to escape, then the fault must be with the Legislature, and not with the Commissioner. we ought to be quite honest, and admit candidly that this measurehas always been a complete misfit to Australian conditions"".",60,Assessment Bill Second Reading

These figures disclose the fact that one set of people gets an extranot been so ordinary large share of the national income, while the rest of the community apparently have a big struggle to live. This information was supplied by the persons themselves in a schedule prepared for the alternative under the war census regulations, and probably it was upon information so obtained that the Government have decided to bring in this measure. If the B ill is intended to tighten up the provisions of the existing law, and enable the Government to obtain more of the money which should be paid in the for m of taxation on'. war-time profits, I welcome it ; but I stronprly object to those exemptions which, according to the Treasurer, w ill mean a loss of £20,000.",61,Assessment Bill Second Reading

The Treasurer will have to give better reasons for throwing away £20,000 of revenue as is proposed by the exemption in this Bill before the proposal has my support.

It was desired that the country should practically become one huge Arsenal. exigencies of the war were such that it was essential that the industrial centres of the United Kingdom should concentrate on the supply of munitions and armaments; and this for m of legislation was introduced, first of all, to divert peaceful industries into the channels I have mentioned; and, secondly, to enable the Government to secure a reasonable share of the. extra profits being made by army contractors and agents. liberately discourage the expansion of ordinary channels of industry, and to encourage munition and armament making, that the British Act was passed. Australia is in quite a different position! We are not engaged in the making of munitions of war, nor do we desire that our industrial centres should divert their operations On recognise that, in view of our heavy war .expenditure, it is essential that we should develop, expand, and encourage our industries in every direction in order to increase production,, so that we may be able to meet our liabilities. here are the very opposite to those which existed in GreatB r it a in when the Wartime ProfitsB ill was introduced there. Any thoughtful consideration to the. terms of the principal Act w ill that it seeks to secure revenue at the expense of industrial expansion. It is anomalous that, while on the one hand we pass Bounty Bills to encourage industry, on the other we pass legislation of this kind, which is immediately destructive of all incentive to enterprise and the starting of new industries. This class of legislation retards and stifles industry. I have urged from the first that it is a mistake; and the arguments that I used when the original B ill was before us in 1916 are now being realized. The Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) practically tells us that, in the original Act , we made a mistake. He tells us that, as the result of that Act, industry has been retarded, but [11 DECEMBER, 1918.] Assessment Bill. 9077 that he hopes to modify the conditions that have brought about the discounting of our industrial efforts. When introducing this B ill , he said, speaking of the s existing ActTheI believe, too, that, to some extent, it has retarded new business enterprises, and has discouraged the expansion of existing undertakings. I hope that the proposal now submitted may relieve thc situation It w ill relieve it to only a very slight extentcausing the tax to operate more equitably, and with a less repressive effect. . Later on, he saidTlie argument against the original measure It was to dewas that it would operate, not only to discourage, but even to crush new enterpr'ses. That was the argument that I strongly advanced in 1916In studying the circumstances of the new -businesses that have come within the 1915-16 assessment, it is plain that the tax has operated with repressive effect. This is the testimony of the Acting Prime the contrary, we Minister, after f u l l consultation with his executive officers. Here we have the clear evidence of a man qualified to speak with authority on the subject, that the effect of the War-time ProfitsA c t has been to injure, repress, and retard indusThe conditions try, and to strike a blow at our industrial concerns. All along I have urged that it is the duty of this Parliament to repeal the principal Act. It is all very well to suggest that to repeal it would be to grant man who gives honest and relief to those who have been profiteering. If the revenue which would be raised by realize means of this measure must still be secured, there is an infinitely more effective means of obtaining it , and one that would relieve our taxation system from the extraordinary incidence of this Act. The War-time Profits Act. practically eliminates all the fundamentals of taxation. Such a thing as equality of sacrifice cannot be discovered, even in microscopic form, within its four corners. It has sunk, beyond all trace, every fundamental principle of taxation. . On the other hand, it bristles with the most in equitable features. The' New Zealand Government took action to repeal it3 War-time Profits Act after it had been in operation for only twelve months. Under that Act there was only a 45 per 9078 oent. instead of a 50 per cent, and 75 per cent. tax. The Government realized, however,. that the cost of administering it was so great, and that it was so inequitable in its incidence, and so inapplicable to the conditions prevailing in the Dominion, that it must be repealed forthwith. I have here the remarks made by the Treasurer of New Zealand, which go to show that it was in the interests of the Dominion that the Act should be repealed. If I remember rightly, the New Zealand Government imposed in its stead a special war tax of so mu.ch in the f l above a certain income. As I have already said, the Acting Prime Minister has condemned, in the most unmistakable terms, the operation of the principal Act. In introducing this B ill , he said that it was proposed to amend the definition of new businesses which had been disastrously affected by the Act at present in operation. only modification that he suggests, however, is that the definition of "" new business"" shall be as follows:. A business which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, was not commenced u n t i l on or man would venture to deny that I have after the .4th day of August, 1913, and was stated the true position.

In that B ill , the honourable gentleman followed the British provision, not so f a r as the percentage rate of profit he proposed was concerned, but he provided that increased capital should, in the case of companies, be entitled to deduct a statutory percentage of profit equal to 6 per cent., and, in the case of individuals, to 7 per cent. ThatB ill was not passed, but in August last a B ill was introduced by the late lamented Lord Eorrest, then Sir John Forrest, in which he asked Parliament to alter the terms so f a r as increased capital was concerned. He proposed, in addition to the statutory percentage standard of profit, which was fixed at 10 per cent., that-increased capital should have the benefit alternatively of the pre-war happened to be the greater. was inserted in the Parliament at the request of Lord Forrest, and the taxpayer was thereby given the option of the pre-war standard of profit or the statutory percentage of profit, and it is this new provision thus inserted and passed that the B ill proposes to strike out from the 1st of July, 1916. asked to declare it made a mistake, and that the new provision should be regarded as though it had never been in serted. Upon the f a it h of that provision, deliberately enacted by this Parliament, traders and manufacturers have regulated their businesses, and, in a vast number of cases, instead of taking out their profits, they have capitalized those profits. They have put them [336] I tliink that machinery, and improvements of various descriptions. do. Sir EOBEETBEST J u s t so; that was the object of the provision. They were deliberately invited to put their profits into plant, and expand their industries.

I have said that huge businesses which are fully capitalized, and have a good pre-war standard, are not taxed in any way by fchis B ill , although they are the competitors of the progressive businesses that are specially picked out for taxation under it .

There is a vast number of businesses, such as those In other words, Parliament is dealing with millinery, neckwear, knitted goods, underclothing, mantles, and costumes, which tur n their capital over three and four times a year. In the case of such businesses the capital is no proper index to the character or magnitude of the business. The true test, and what should be considered, is the percentage of profit fco turnover.

In 1914, my partner and myself decided that we would not draw any profits out of our business during the period of the war, nor until such time after, the war as we considered things had become more or less normal. As a result of that policy, we added, during'the year's 1.914, 1915, 1916, and 1917, largely to our reserve fund. This, of course, provided the firm with a considerable amount of extra capital, which enabled us to do a considerably increased business. But, on this increased business, we have not attempted to get more than our ordinary rate of profit as in pre-war years, believing in thc principle that it is better to have a big trade at a lower rate of profit than a small trade at a high rate. For the years 1912, 1913, and 1914, say the three pre-war years, our profits on cost averaged 17 per cent., whereas for the years 191617-18 they have only averaged 15 per cent. But because of the increased turnover due to the expansion of capital, we have made a considerable amount of extra profit, never, of' course, thinking that the Government, or any Government, would repudiate an Act which had been passed by Parliament, and make it retrospective for a period of two years.. This have not engaged in profiteering, but have carried on onr business legitimately as merchants. He goes on to say-° The cruel part of this war-times profits tax is that the Government not only take the bulk of the profits which we have employed in the business for the purpose of expansion, but it now proposes only to allow us 10 per cent, on the added capital instead of the pre-war That rate which the Act originally provided for, and which is regarded as' o,nly fair. I again emphasize the point that the Government should consider in connection withits'War-time Profits Act amendment the postwar losses which merchants will have to face. I shall deal with that aspect of the matterin a fewminutes The writer of thisletter continuesIn one factory which we control, and from which we have not had a dividend during the currency of the war, having been obliged to allow profit to remain in to provide for theexpansion of the business, we employed in 1914, before the outbreak of the war seventy hands,, whereas at the present time we have 450. In this instance, too, bis losses will have to be faced in connection with the stock that, is carried, and tlie whole of the profits have been I left in the business, and have gone into machinery, plant, and buildings. That information is from a man in a large way, whose name I am prepared to give to any honourable member privately. He is an enterprising man, who, following the policy laid down by Parliament,, has increased and expanded his business,, and. now, after he has invested his capital in it , it is proposed to punish him for his enterprise. I could give a number of similar cases. I have here another case,, in which a man with a capital of £34,000* is to be penalized to the amount of £7,782 , whereas' the proprietor, of an oldestablished business in the same line would pay nothing. The refined cruelty of the measure isnoticeable from thisaspect of it , that the percentage standard is not merely to apply to the increase of capital, beyond that employed by the taxpayer on 1st July, 1916, the date to which the measure goes back, but to the increase beyond the average capital for. pre-war years.

303,Sir Robert Best,"On a profit ofau amending B ill was introduced by our Forrest, I fought strongly for the in clusion in it of a provision which was clause 10 of a B ill introduced by the lonorable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), and embodied the British law on the subject. lionorable gentleman did not accept my proposal. t h a t an average is to be taken, extending over the period of the war, to ascertain what the war-time profits are, and these are to be taxed accordingly. That, is a sound and legitimate provision. A measure providing. for the taxation of war-time profits should do what it saysthat is, it should tax excess profits made during the whole period of the war. TJnder the B ill before us* if a man made a profit of £10,000 in the year 1915-16, a heavy loss in the next year, another loss in the third year^ and a small profit in the fourt h year, he would be taxed on his profits, but would receive no allowance in -respect of his losses. TJnder the English law there is an averaging of profits and losses over the period of the war. We provide for the averaging of capital in pre-war years, and for an averaging of pre-war profits, but when we come to deal w it h war-time profits, we take each year ""by itself. If a man makes a profit in' one year, he is taxed on it , and if he makes a, loss in the next year so much the worse for h i m , he receives no allowance. I do not desire that the British law should be -slavishly followed, but, as a matter of principle, when taxing war-time profits you cannot fairl y consider only the years in which profits have been made, and leave out of account the years in which losses have been incurred. I urge that an average should be made of the profits and losses during the period of the war, to ascertain the amount on which, a business is properly taxable. No business man can know until the war has ended, and his -stocks are realized, whether he has made any profit during the war. Merchants have had to buy stocks at vastly-increased prices, and have now to realize them on a falling -market, and, therefore, will inevitably suffer heavy losses. likely to lose £50,000. £3361-2 lamented friend, the ' late Lord ent from whose communication I have already quoted says about thisNow, with regard to the profits we have made during the war years, we take the view, which no doubt many others in our way of business do, that these profits can only be Unfortunately, the right held as a set-off against the post-war losses which, we feel certain, must accrue.

Now, since the signing of the armistice the reaction has set in , and during the last three weeks, on one section of our goods of which we hold a stock of £150,000, there has beeu a fal l of 15 per cent.; on the whole of our stock, which represents probably £400,000, it is safe to say that we will have to write off by next stocktaking at least £100,000 to bring it down to current values, and further losses than this will have to be . sustained before bed-rock is reached. position if we applied' the principle of averaging to our' general taxation's and refunds are provided for in the income tax law, but, in any case, justice ought to be done. In seeking to tax wartime profits, we should see that only the excess profits made during the period of the war are taxed. We ought not to tax the profits made in one year, and take no account of the losses suffered in the next The true method upon which to proceed is to ascertain what the excess war-timeprofits are, and to tax them.

A t the same time it has discouraged the investment of capital. I have quoted the Acting Prime Minister for the purpose of demonstrating that fact, and I merely wish to add that this policy is in direct opposition to the enlightened policy that has been followed And in some by other communities. Take the case of Japan, for example. She is so solicitous about the expansion of her existing \ r i we dustries, and the creation of new ones', that the Government there have even gone so f a r as to guarantee to people who are The position is that, so far, prepared to start industries in various directions, a profit of 8 per cent.

In the United States of America' it has been discovered that the effect of the war Now, -althoug h she has been in ifc only since Good Friday of 1916-ha s been to direct all industries toward munition making, and to seriously depress other industries.

The machinery needed for the purpose was too elaborate to enable the revenue to be These are words founded on experience collected when it was required. The method of a similar tax in New Zealand, and I adopted here was substantially on the lines of venture to say that the experience here is the English excess profits tax, but, as the precisely the same. The only true policy amount realized did not reach my estimate, I of the Government under all the condipropose this year to re-adjust this form of taxation. I venture to say that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth will receive a rude awakening by the results of this war-time profits tax, which will not produce anything like what we expect. I do not look forward to the tax producing anything, so far as the profits for the current yeaT are concerned. I may say that if the profits tax were to be retained and doubled in rate, so as to make it 00 per cent., it would not provide the amount required. I , therefore, must ask the House to authorize such a change of taxation as will make it certain that larger sums shall be contributed by those who have nut paid tlieir just share under the profits tax. The adjustment I propose will not only provi.de. the amount of revenue -I require, but it will insure that every one shall contribute in proportion to his means. That is the point. The New Zealand Treasurer there shows that wealthy industries have been permitted to absolutely escape-hug e industries making enormous profits-^and the smaller industries alone have suffered. Experience of the excess profits tax has also shown that it is inequitable. Thc concessions necessary to avoid hardship in some cases resulted in thc escape of many other taxpayers who were in a position to pay, and, in my opinion, should have paid. Tlie main reason for this is that the conditions here are different from those in the older countries. In this young country there is a larger proportion of concerns in the process of development than is the case in the older countries, and the into an enterprise, lie expects to get some tax presses ""unduly on them. The profits made on shipping and munition contracts in Great Britain are enormous. There are thousands of long-established industrial, commercial, and general businesses that can be safely insure a largo amount of revenue from a profits tax. It is not so here; on largely reduced the profits that under ordinary conditions would be earned by export business houses, and an cquivalent'amount cantions is to grasp this problem, and repeal the whole Act, thereby doing a fair measure of justice to our industries. man who has made excess profits in consequence of the war should, in my opinion, ""shell o u t "" some of those profits. There are men, particularly in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, who have made enormous profits; and only a few weeks ago the Bulletin instanced one shipping firm which has done so. It is to those people we should direct our attention, and not to the primary producers. If there is one man more than another who has to face the vicissitudes of nature, it is the man wbo is getting a living off the land; and I am sure there is not an honourable member who would like to tax himoff his holding. If this measure passes, I know many properties in' Western Queensland which will become practically valueless. There are several instances in my mind of men who had been struggling for years before the war, and had spent huge sums in retrieving their herds, purchasing bulls at very high prices in order to improve the quality of the breed. Yet these men. have made hardly anything out of their runs, though we know that when a person enters business it is not on philanthropic grounds; if he puts his good ""gilt"" good "" g i l t "" out of it.

Every penny that these, brothers made up to the time of the war was put into improvements;, and now, as I say, their herd is the best inQueensland. Up to six or seven years ago, cattle in Queensland was "" anybody's money."" There is one particular herd that the honourable member for Grampians well knows -the Mount Cornish herd of shorthorns -whic h is one of the most beautiful in Australia. they are more like elephants than bullocks. Yet the owners of this station, through the low price of stock, only a few years ago-sinc e I have heen in the Federal Parliament-ha d to get r i d of the whole of their cattle and take up sheep. If the herd of cattle had remained there to this day, the taxation on the owners would have been, enormous, notwithstanding their losses during drought. The pastoralists of Western Queensland do not object to pay this tax, but they do object, to paying it on their losses. When, in 1915, the then Treasurer of the Labour Government ( Mr Higgs) introduced a War-time ProfitsB ill , it contained a clause designed to get over that difficulty. It was clause* 10 of that B ill , and, as it appeals to me as a most reasonable one, I think it ought to be readWhere a person proves that in any accounting period, ending after tlie 30th day of June, 19.15, his profits have not reached the point vvhich involves liability to war-time profits tax, or that he has sustained a loss in his business, he shall be entitled: -(a) to repayment of such amount paid by him as war-time profits tax in respect of any previous accounting, period, or (6) to set. off against any war-time profitstax payable by him in respect of any succeeding accounting period during, The the war such' an amount as will make the total amount of war-time profits tax paid by him during the whole period, accord with his profits or losses during that period.

To-day, in Western Queensland there is raging one of the most serious droughts we have had. Prior to the drought the pastoralists and farmers had suffered from very severe bush fires.

It does not require much arithmetical ability to sec that argument. If 10 per cent, is a-fair profit in ordinary business, it is too low in a risky business. I have often said that the only assets we have in this country are grass and water. Without rain, we cannot get grass; and only a few years ago, there were many places where there was beautiful grass country. I refer particularly to a station called Wellshot. Since the advent of artesian boring a big watersupply has I do not want honourable been secured for that dry but beautiful grass country. There are hundreds of square miles on those Wellshot downs, which were practically waterless, but which to-day are carrying hundreds of thousands of head of stock. Surely those men responsible-for the improvement of that territory are entitled to something for their enteqwise. W ill any one tell me of a more risky game than stock-raising, particularly in Queensland? I do not forget that we have tc thank Victoriaf o r much of our success in stock-raising in the back of Queensland. I suppose that f u l l y 80 per cent, of the capital invested in Western Queensland came from that State. It has sent us workers, selectors, and station-owners of the very best class. They have taken their courage in both hands, and their money in th^ir pockets, and spent it in Western Queensland like toffs. Two of them went through with nearly £80,000, and took up Stainburn Downs. They were model employers. In those days things were very "" umptidoo.""

Many young men have come to me in Victoria, telling me that they would like to go on ""stations in Western Queensland, and I have wired .to friends of mine whom I knew to be good bosses. In no instance has one of them refused to take any person whom I recommended. To-day some of those whom I sent away in those circumstances are prosperous grazing farmers in Queensland, while others have come back with £300 or £400 each, and commenced dairy farming in Victoria. All that has happened within the last eighteen or nineteen years. But those men were anxious to get on. They took their courage in their hands when they went to North Queensland, and now that they are twenty years older, they are enjoying the benefits of the work they did up there. It shows that the district is not too bad after all. I want to instil this into the mind of the honourable member for South Sydney or Botany Bay, as I , from lack of the geographical knowledge of Sydney, am in the habit of calling the district where so much fellmongering is carried on. The letter which I have received proceedsThere is another way of looking at it . This business has been carried on for forty years; nothing has ever been taken out of it ; in that period, or during the t h i r t y years of thc prewhich to-day threaten to recur. sent owner's control, a certain amount of thc profit has gone into it . A f a i r method of fixing the capital on which the 10 per cont. -(the percentage standard to be allowed in -order to arrive at standard profits) would be -to allow 10 per cont. simple interest annually -on capital put into the concern, including -original cost, and to set off against this 10 -per cent, for any year the amount of proflts returned to the business again. There is a third way, and simple way, ;and it looks as .if this was one reading of the present Act; but it. is not too clear. See section 17(H) of the present Act. There, the capital of a business is taken to be the amount I know many men who of the capital "" paid -up .by the owner in money or in kind,"" & c , & c . Some hold the view that this means that the capital should be valued, because, in the case of a pastoral property where breeding goes on, the natural increase may be said to be a contribution in kind. It might, however, be made quite clear that the capital was to be ascertained by calculation as at the time of the imposition of the scheme of taxation, or even at the date of the outbreak of war. ought to be capitalization. bers do not know how the assessment is made. In one case the assessment was made on the number of lambs. The owners paid the tax on that basis, but twelve months afterwards a drought had killed off every hoof. In another case the owners were assessed on the number of calves, at 5s. per head. In this instance within twelve months the whole of the calves were dead. The owners had paid the tax, but they did not have a hoof alive. The letter proceedsW it h pastoral properties, there should be no difficulty about that. Tlic value of the stock is known,and the value of the holding, which largely consists of the improvements on the property; and these have been paid for out of capital. Whichever of these modifications of the law is made, it is plain, if justice is to be done to those who have had the pluck to t r y and create settlement in these drought-stricken areas, one or other alternative should be conceded. The increased income is only remotely connected with war. Probably, if there had ""been no war, and a "" p a t r i o t i c ' ' contract for the benefit of the Army meat supply had not been made by the Queensland Government with the Imperial Government, there would have been more profit in an open market. Por the world, in1913-14, was short of meat, anyhow, and getting shorter every year. Tlie profit is entirely due to good seasons, and it is on these good seasons that these pastoralists depend for the purpose of maintaining themselves through the inevitable drought years, The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley) still keeps on droning, "" The poor pastoralist.""

373,. Mr Rodgers (Wannon) [9.11],"It..The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Page) has very ably put the pretty bad case of the northern pastoral industry, and the northern cattle industry in particular, as distinct from the tory. But, strangely enough,-those years"" northern sheep industry. In cattle raising, you do not get an annual clip. The rainfal l in those areas is very low, and the history of the migration from Victoria to Queensland is very much as described by the lastspeaker. men left Victoria prior to the 'nineties, taking their cattle with them. Many of them mortgaged Victorian estates, and embarked in the industry in Northern Queensland. The history of a number of them has been disastrous. Many of them have been driven out of the business ruined, although they held excellent positions in Victoria, and have had to take positions as boundary riders, or in other capacities on stations. I have here a specific case. The figures and facts are vouched for, and I propose to put them on record. The property has been for twenty-six or twenty-seven years in the hands of one family. During that period there were sixteen years of profits and ten years of losses. Prom 1890 to 1892 was what they called the ""knocko u t "" period in Queensland, when men who had not big banking accounts behind them, or credits in other States, went right out of the industry. From 1896 to 1901 was throughout a droughty period, and the cattle on this property were reduced from 22,000 head to 1,800 head. The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Page) has stated the position of these men in a general way. I am dealing with a North Queensland cattle proposition, in a light rainfall area, where the industry cannot be sustained except by balancing the good years against the bad years. I propose to give a list of twentysix years' operations on one of the finest cattle stations in Queensland. The aggregate, profit for the sixteen successful years was £53,000, and the aggregate loss in the ten bad years was £30,000, leaving only a net profit of £23,000. During the whole of that time the family has not drawn £ 1 from the property, except for working and living expenses. By astuteness and the employment of their capital in careful selection and breeding they built up the property until, during the last three or four years, it yielded the greatest profit in its hisfall within the taxable period prescribed, by the Act. Through all those otheryears they battled on in the developmentof their property, and now the incidence of this taxation is to swoop down upon Many the profits made in the three years when the family were reaping what may be considered a fair reward for their life's work, taking 50 per cent, in the first year and 75 per cent, in the subsequent years. The section of tbe A ct defining "" capital "" affords no relief to this family, and I ask that there shall be allowed, in respect of all such properties, a capitalization at 7 per cent., commencing from the date when the property was acquired, or a greater percentage of profit. This station was purchased in 1888 for £50,000. It is entirely a cattle proposition. During the whole thirty years there have been alternations of good and bad seasons. In 1902 new holdings were added, and boring was undertaken for artesian and sub-artesian water with more or less success. The net profits made in the good years were re-invested in the property, u n t i l in 1915 the capital actually sunk in it amounted to £115,000. A t this time, owing to the increase in the water supply and general improvement of the property, they had increased the number of calves branded from 2,000 to 6,000 in one year, but the. honourable member for Maranoa will admit that 6,000 calves may be branded and brought into a man's taxable assets, but all of them may die before they can be brought into his balance-sheet. mated value of the property to-day? content with a valuation of £118,000. I ask that, in respect of such cattle propositions in Queensland-no t in a State like Victoria, which has a fair climate, and where the average results are fairly good-ther e shall be a capitalization at 7 per cent, simple interest from the date of commencement, or a higher rate of profit, say, 20 per cent.",77,Poster But The Honori T Must Be Remembered That He Is Depen

I now call the attention of the Treasurer to a glaring anomaly in the administration of the war-time profits tax, and to what I believe to be an ambiguity in the -Act itself. iSection 17 gives this definition of "" capital""The amount of capital of a business shall be taken 'to be 'the amount of its capital paid up of my case. The intention of the Legist by the owner in money. I desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer the position occupied by owners of landed property-that is, -several owners holding freehold land separately, but working it jointly in partnership. In his administration of the Act the Commissioner interprets the word "" owner "" in the singular, and not in the plural sensej with the result that owners holding land separately, but working it jointly, do not get the benefit of the 10 per cent, exemption on their capital. definite statement made by the former Treasurer, the late 'Lord Forrest, when he brought down this measure. "" This,"" he said, ""is not a tax on individuals. It is a tax on a business."" I respectfully submit for the Treasurer's consideration that it does not matter whether a business is carried on by a single individual or whether it is carried on by three or four persons in partnership. It remains a business, and all the capital employed in it should be regarded as capital of the business, and enjoy 10 per cent, exemption. referring to a case in. which the stock of the business is jointly owned, and the land severally owned ? the Treasurer that another enactment has been passed, the Eederal land tax, to prevent the aggregation of holdings. Well, here is a case in which a family property had been divided into four sections. Four sons each took a section, but agreed, for the purpose of economy, to manage it as one property, pooling their land and their stock, but the land remaining as -the separate property of members of the family. That, I claim, is only one business. They cannot divide property to evade the land tax and also escape this tax. Treasurer has made that statement, because I thought that was in his mind, but I believe that eminent legal authority in this country holds an opposite view'. But that does not matter for the purpose lature in regard to that measure was that estates should be cut up, and in the case to which I refer, the property was divided into four holdings. tion of the Legislature.. I again remind the Treasurer of the statement made by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) at the time.

I want to argue this question on its merits. I submit that in the case to which I refer the family had compliedwith the intention of the Legislature. Suppose fouT brothers enter into partnership in a business in this city, and employ, say, £100,000 for the purchase of a business, renting a Elinders-street property. On the whole of that capital they will get the advantage of a. 10 per cent., exemption. Buti f they determine to go into partnership on the land, and in a bona fide manner purchase four separate holdings side by side, but decide, for the purpose of economy, to work them in partnership, they could not get the benefit of this 10 per cent, exemption on. their capital. actly the same if they go into partnership and put in money or kind. is so.

I have no desire to labour the question, but I am convinced that a great injustice is being done to a particular section of . the community. The Act says that the capital of a business shall be taken as the amount paid by the owner in money or in kind. That does not affect the point I am making. The trouble is that there is no definition of "" owner."" The question is, do they pool their lands and stock? If so, then it is capital of the business, and is allowed accordingly. If it is not pooled, but is held separately, thei-e is no allowance.'

The Act allows for a pre-war standard for exemption of 10 per cent, on capital. The fundamental intention of the Legislature was to give all the capital employed in a business, whether a single business or a partnership, an immunity of 10 per cent. But, later, some cases which had cropped up were submitted for the consideration of the Treasurer, and he agreed that if there were greater earnings than 10 per cent the taxpayer would have the right v to select, as a pre-war standard, any two of the six pre-war years. Eor the life of me I cannot see anything in the Act Which gives the Treasurer or Taxing Master the right to treat "" owners "" differently from "" owner."" will look at the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, he will see that words in the singular include the plural, and vice versa. There is no legal difficulty about that, so far as I am aware. counsel have been looking into this matter, and expressed the opinion that owners or partners are entitled to the full exemption of 10 per cent. I .would much prefer that this matter were made clear in the Act, because we do not want our taxpayers to be involved in litigation or come into conflict with the Commissioner on a matter of interpretation.

I am going to show that if a property is held in partnership it is taxed under the War-time Profits Act, even though it may not yield 5 per cent, interest on capital. Surely this is a grave injustice, seeing that captains of industry-wealth y men-ca n enjoy incomes up to 10 per cent, and escape taxation. I submit now a clear case of injustice.

The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr of only 2 per cent, on their purchases. Tudor) spoke enthusiastically of direct taxation, «nd said he wished that We had more of it. In my judgment no factor has operated more in the direction of increasing the cost of living than has the war-time profits tax. tax was passed there was a fresh stocktaking 'throughout Australia. Everyone began to consider how he could adjust his business and make his old-time profits with less risk on a smaller turnover. do not desire that men who make big profits should escape proper taxation, nor do I find much comfort in the statement that taxation similar to this is in operation in the Old Country, since the conditions operating there are altogether different. I am content to allow this law to operate until the period fixed for its termination, and I hope we shall have from the Treasurer a distinct promise that at the very outside it will not be continued after 30th June next. vious occasion this evening I was not afforded -an opportunity to record my protest against a Bill that had been introduced by the Government; hut in this case I wish to explain that, although I strongly favour the principle of taxing those who make profits out of the war at the expense of their country, I do not believe in hampering businesses that are struggling for existence in a new country. En a comparatively new country like this 'there must always be young businesses which are developing and growing as the years go by, quite irrespective of whether we have war or peace. made undue profits during the war they should bo taxed, but surely the section in the British Act which averages the profits that a man has made over the four years of war provides an equitable method of determining whether or not he has been profiteering. When I asked the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) to-day what he meant by "" profiteering "" he said that profiteering was the making of undue profits. I was interviewed this week by men who have been doing a tremendous turnover. They turned over their capital no less than seventeen times in the one year, but they made a profit turnover of capital? goods at a profit of 2 per cent., so that since they turned over their capital Immediately the seventeen times they made a profit of 34 per cent, in the year. But because a man has the industry and energy to turn over his capital so many times in a year, are we to say that, although he makes -only I 2 per cent, on each turnover he is robbing the people, or profiteering? capital over twice a week. selling his goods at a profit of 2 per cent, it cannot be said that he is profiteering. The War-time Profits Act has caused more irritation and disturbances of feeling on the part of the commercial community than has any other Act of Parliament. tions Act. pared with the War-time Profits Act. Honourable members generally desire that no man should make undue profits out of his fellow citizens when the nation is passing through a period of stress and trial. Let us look at the facts in this case. It was estimated that the Government would collect about £1,400,000 in respect of the operation of this tax last year. I understand that the Department only collected £600,000. £1,000,000, and £600,000 was collected If men have in the first year, and practically the balance has since been collected as arrears. got into financial difficulties, and had to make arrangements with their bankers or other persons to finance them to enable them to pay the taxation imposed by the Government. in assessments sometimes. some extent, but it certainly created a 1 great deal of difficulty for traders and",82,Poster But The Honori T Must Be Remembered That He Is Depen

429,Mr Boyd,"It. may have been tobusiness people generally. Tbe Bill now before the House will create a great deal more difficulty. By an Act of this Parliament, we said to business people, "" There is the law, and under it you can conduct your business."" Now the Government propose to amend the law by altering the fundamental conditions on the faith of which men have invested their capital. They have invested money in machinery, in new buildings, and in ' other means to develop and expand their businesses, and all this has given increased employment, but now the Government tell them under this Bill that they will be allowed only a profit of 10 per cent, on the new capital which they have put into those businesses. The Treasurer ( Mr Watt), in introducing this Bill, said"" I am aware that the Act has proved irritating to many persons."" "" The Government is alive to the fact that during the last twelve months there has been a sustained agitation for the repeal of this Act."" "" In studying the circumstances of the new businesses that have come within the 1915-16 assessment it is plain that the tax has operated with repressive effect."" this? speech. indeed. There was some little interlude between the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) and the Treasurer, and I believe that the honourable member for Indi (Mt. Leckie) interjected, ""This will be retrospective for three years,"" and the Treasurer said in replyThat is one of the difficulties in regard to the operation of War-time Profits Acts; but, since our -financial necessities are great and increasing, we cannot write an indemnity ticket for any citizen who speculates. shares. doubt that the necessities of the Treasurer were pressing when this legislation was introduced. Every member of the House must sympathize with the honourable gentleman in his desire to obtain money wherever he can to meet the necessities of the Government during the current financial year. But times have changed. not gone down. surer can see at least £20,000,000 cut off his anticipated total of £80,000,000 for war expenditure, and in view of that saving in expenditure, and in view of the fact that £1,600,000 is all that will be collected .under this measure, if the whole of the taxation due under it is obtained, 1 ask the Treasurer to consider whether the continued imposition of this wartime profits taxation is worthwhile. the honourable member refers as likely to be saved will be saved from loan expendi. ture. but the Treasurer is contributing a considerable amount of revenue this, year towards the payment of the war debt. knows better than does the Treasurer the fear, turmoil, and tribulation which the war-time profits tax has caused, and I ask him to consider whether it is worthwhile, for the sake of £1,600,000, to create so much trouble in the community, and so much turmoil in business, when at the same time the honourable gentleman is aware that it is impossible to impose taxation of this kind scientifically. I venture to think that if the Treasurer will seriously consider the matter he will find that for the anticipated revenue from it , it is not worthwhile to continue this taxation. I intended to speak on this Bill at some considerable length, but as the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert -Best) has dealt very clearly with many of the points I intended to put, it is not necessary that I should repeat what he has said. In connection with the ap.peals that are being constantly made, and one of which I submitted to the Treasurer today, I urge that it would be wise for the Government to appoint the Board of Referees provided for in the principal Act at the very earliest moment.

There is another matter which I should like the Treasurer to consider. He proposes an amendment of the existing Act, granting exemption from war-time profits taxation to agents who make their livelihood from a purely agency business. That w ill give considerable relief to these men, no doubt; but it is difficult to draw the line of demarcation between a man who makes his living as an agent and one who makes an income from commission as an agent, and at the same time is concerned in some small business for the sake of increasing his income. I have in mind the case of a gentleman in this community who can retire from the business in which he is engaged, and still make £10,000 a year profit out of his agency, without a cent of his own money being invested in the business for which he is agent. I know the case of another man who makes £600 a year out of an agency business, and who from a side line in commercial life makes £800 or £900 a year. The latter man making £1,500 a year from his agency and his business will be taxed under this B ill on the whole of his profits, whilst the other man can make £10,000 out of* an agency, and, as he is not carrying on a business, will not be taxed under this measure at all. If it is rio;ht in principle to exempt an agent, the exemption should apply to all agents. all? argument falls to the ground; but if some are exempt and others are included, the Bill will treat those who are included very unfairly The only other matter to which I wish to refer is the proposal to allow only the statutory percentage of 10 per cent, profit on new capital. The Government will be well advised if they reconsider their proposal to l i m it the interest on new capital invested in a business to 10 per cent. If the limitation were to be made to apply to the current year 1918, no man. could raise his voice in opposition to it . Business people would be given a fair I am certain that warning that the limitation would apply to their operations this year, and before they had allocated their profits. Buti t is proposed under the B ill thafc the provision shall be retrospective for two and a half years. A f t e r a man has operated his business under the provision of the existing law, by which he is entitled to the pre-war standard of profits on his in creased capital, it is notdealing fairly with him to make an amendment of the conditions under which he has carried on his business, retrospective. If the Government would say that they require thafc the profit allowed on new capital shall not be more than 10 per cent, for this year, I should be prepared to support them, because then every man in business would know what he had to expect. I believe that, on reflection, the Treasurer will probably consider that it is unwise to make this proposal retrospective for two and a half years. As the honourable gentleman is aware, I have in the State Parliament of Victoria, as well as in this Parliament, always strenuously opposed retrospective taxation or legislation of any kind. I do not believe in it . I consider it immoral on the part of any Parliament to legislate backwards. morality of the profiteers? "" tripe "" of that kind talked. We hear general statements made about profiteers, but no one in this House, or anywhere else, has yet said who the profiteers are. ber said that he has no sympathy with them. ber now says that they do not exist. that they do exist in this country. There has not been the opportunity for profiteering here. Honourable members have referred to the high price of galvanized iron. They have said, "" L o o k how we are being robbed!

To-night I heard that the moment the war collapsed wire-netting, which had been quoted at £112 per ton, was quoted by a firm at £ 4 5 per ton. They had not any on hand, but they knew where they could get some. of boots go up 50 per cent. ? of manufacturing them increased, or that there was more difliculty in obtaining leather. You must know the whole of the circumstances surrounding an increase in price before you can be sure that there has been profiteering. The price of kerosene, for instance, is three times as high as it was before the war, and people exclaim that the man who is selling kerosene is profiteering. No regard is paid to the fact that he probably was charged six times as much for freight as he had formerly to pay. When reference is made to the increase in freight, it is thought that the ship-owner must be making huge profits; it being forgotten that half his vessels have been torpedoed, that wages have gone up, that the crowd supporting honourable members opposite goes on strike occasionally, and that then ships lie at the wharfs, piling up demurrage. these things honourable members forget deliberately. I make a final appeal to the Treasurer to reconsider the operation of the 10 per cent, on added capital, and ask him to agree to an amendment to make it apply to this year only, and. not retrospectively for two and a half years. The Treasurer ( MrW a t t ) , when speaki t off the statute-book as soon as possible. ing on the War Precautions Act , expressed a desire that we should get back to normal conditions of trade and industry as soon as possible. He has an opportunity to expedite that process by load at very reduced prices large stocks putting an end to the operation of this bought at very heavy cost, and for that tax at the earliest possible moment. I do reason this financial year is not likely to not think that it should continue a day yield nearly as much from the tax as was beyond the end of the present year. It . originally estimated. is a war-time profits t a x ; the war is now over; and the tax should, therefore, end this year is the tax on the 1916-17 assesswith this year. I do not propose to traverse the arguments of previous speakers. I support the appeal that the 10 per cent, on added capital shall not be made retrospective. I hope, too, that the honourable gentleman will take note of the cogent reasons that have been advanced in favour of averaging profits during the accounting period, so that the tax may be levied on the profits actually made . during the period of the war, and not assessed on returns for individual years. I shall not I suppose the difficulty labour these points, because the B ill is one to be dealt with in Committee, where they can be discussed separately, and settled. I consider the amendments now proposed an improvement on the original Act, but we should at the earliest moment relieve those who are prepared to invest capital in new businesses by the abolition of this tax. It is by the establishment of new businesses that the pressing liabilities incurred during the war will be met. The tax should be abolished, not only so that those investing in new businesses may be able to make a profit from their enterprise, but in order that confidence may be given to investors. The Treasurer's speeches are generally very able; indeed it sometimes takes the House a considerable time to recover from their hypnotic influence, and to discover that the proposals which they support are not All as perfect as they had been made to appear. In a very able speech regarding this tax the honourable gentleman saidI helieve, too, that to some extent it has retarded new business enterprises, and has discouraged the expansion of existing undertakings. That, to my mind, is an indictment of the tax, and the Treasurer should meet the wishes of members generally by striking In my opinion that would cause no serious loss of revenue.

459,Mr Brtjce (Flinders) [10.29],"Thisthat, in the true sense of the term, there are no such profits being made here. I agree with this to the extent that there are no great armament or shipbuilding firms in Australia which are making enormous profits. But the profits which are being made in this country to-day are entirely attributable to the war, and to the fact that the people possess a very much greater spending capacity than was ever possessed by them' previously. I can say from my personal experience as managing director of a large business, that, at the present time, the main reason which is contributing to the success of almost all businesses in this country is that more money is being expended by the people. That money is coming from the prices which are being received for the produce of this country, from the expenditure of the Government in respsct of the war, and from the great inflation owing to our enormously increased note issue. But all these factors are attributable to the war, and they are the factors which are enaibling businesses to be conducted successfully. For this reason, nobody can maintain, iwith any show of reason, that no war-time profits are being made in this community. The second reason urged against wartime profits taxation in Australia is that it would be more equitable to raise the revenue that is required by the Government by means of an all-round increase in the income tax. At first sight that apquite sincerely, think that they are helppears to be a sound proposition, because we have to recollect that the businesses which are making more money to-day than they did formerly, would then have to pay taxation, not merely upon their excess profits, but also upon the profits which they made in pre-war days. However, I do not think that that is a fair proposition, because there are certain persons whose' incomes during waT time have not increased, or even' remained stationary, but have decreased. It seems scarcely reasonable that we should levy an additional burden upon people of that class. The third argument advanced against war-time profits taxation is a much more vital and a better one. It is that it puts a curb upon the establishment of new industries. With that contention I entirely agree, and in the absence of some relief in that connection, I would ibe 'compelled to oppose the Bill. But upon this particular matter a concession has been made, and consequently I 'think that the 'whole three arguments have been wiped out. There are various matters upon which I desired to touch in connection with this Bill, but most of them may be more appropriately discussed in Committee. There are, however, one or two broad principles embodied in it to which I wish to refer very briefly, in order that they may have been mentioned before we reach the Committee stage. I allude to certain clauses in the measure relating to new businesses and to other clauses dealing with the introduction of new capital into old businesses. The Government have decided to insert in the Bill two clauses dealing with new businesses, under which they propose to allow such businesses the average rate of profit on capital that is allowed to a successful business of a similar character. In the case of businesses where, there are not similar businesses in existence, the matter is more or less at the discretion of the Commissioner; but, taking the case of a business similar to existing businesses, I personally cannot see that the concession being made is of any real value. I believe that the Government, ing enormously; but I cannot see that they are. There is, in my opinion, very little inducement for new businesses to be started on the same basis as an old, well established, and successful business; and I have worked out as simple an instance as I can in order to demonstrate what will actually happen. Let us take the case of an ordinary business with a capital of £2,000. In the early days of a business, a man has very likely only that £2,000, and before he can put any more in, he has to shift some of the goods he has purchased, for he cannot afford to carry a dead stock. The result is that he pushes his business extraordinarily hard, and will very likely turn over his stock tke first year five or six times, or even seven times. The result of this, on the capital of £2,000, will be, to put it mildly, that if he turns it over from four to five times he does a trade of about £10,000 a year, and his net profit on that turnover is possibly in the region of 7 per cent, or 8 per cent., or a profit of £800. If he has turned his stock over at that rate, he has run it on a margin of Is. 6d. in the £1. He has not been profiteering, but has been merely thrusting his trade because his capital is so small. The result of this legitimate trade in the first year is, as I say, that on the £10,000 he has made a profit in every way legitimate of £800. Let us take the rate on capital to be shown by an established business of a similar character, and put it pretty high, say, 15 per cent. That will mean 15 per cent, on £2,000, or £300; while he has actually made £800. I suggest that this man has 'done nothing but be a hard working, industrious trader; he has made no excessive profits; everything he has sent out to the public has been sold at a fair profit if he only gets 7 to S per cent, on his turnover. It may not be in the knowledge of all honourable members, but a man simply cannot run the risk of conducting a business, unless it is a business of the nature to which the honourable inember for Henty( Mr Boyd) referred, and doing an enormous turnover, on the basis of Is. in the £1, or 5 per cent., because he is almost certain to come to grief. In the instance I have given, the man has been working on 8 per cent., and there is no reason why he should not be entitled to keep that to build up his business. I have given a concrete instance to make honourable members realize that a return on capital in new businesses is not a fair basis to operate on. In an oldestablished business, it is a different matter, for we generally find that if the ratio .of the stock to turnover is 3-& to 4 times, it shows an extraordinarily good and efficient management. that the man has to carry a lot of dead stock that possibly does not go out once a year; and the result is that what is a good percentage for an old business is absolutely an impossible basis for a young Mr Bruce. business which has no capital it can leave dead or idle. I certainly think it would be a good thing if some consideration were given by the Treasurer to this point, because it is a serious one to many businesses. As I have said, I do not think that the encouragement the Government think they are giving to new businesses is, in fact, operative. I can tell the Treasurer that many people, on first looking at the proposal, entirely agreed that the Government had done everything to help; but when they investigated, they found that it did not help very materially. The other point I wish to refer to is with regard to the wiping out of the permission to the proprietors of a business to take its average rate on capital before the war on new capital, and this is a difficult one. I have at the back of my mind a suspicion that certain young businesses started just prior to the war may have earned quite legitimately in the pre-war period a return on capital of 40 to 60 per cent., or even higher, and are still enabled to retain a return on capital at such rates; although, through the introduction of new capital, such a return is out of all reason, and opens the door to ' profiteering. Eor that reason, I cannot vote against what is proposed; but, at the same time, I feel it is a bad principle to go back, and now say we are going to collect for two and a half years. The Act was passed on the 22nd September, 1917, and ever since then the business community have imagined that they have a contract with the Government to retain certain profits. On this they have acted, and either distributed their profits or put them into their businesses. It is a dangerous thing to now upset the whole of tliese commercial operations; but if the Treasurer assures us that the returns for the first year disclose such a position as I have suggested, and certain businesses are getting an improper rate on new capital, I am not The reason is prepared to offer opposition. I think that when we get into Committee we shall be well-advised in seeing whether we can amend the particular clause so as to catch the profiteer, but do no harm to the man who is making a legitimate turnover and getting a reasonable profit. I suggest that when we come to the consideration of new businesses, we can introduce a new principle, which is the principle of percentage to turnover. AndI think we had better look at the next clause as to additional capital, and see if we cannot do the same thing. If we can do that, we shall do no harm to the man who has been making a large turnover and getting a reasonable profit, which means that he is selling at a fair and honourable price, and we shall catch the man who has been doing a turnover made up mostly of profit. I will give an example. Suppose a man does £300 of turnover, which is quite legitimate in that he is legitimately sellposition. It would be an incentive to ing something of a value of nearly £300. That is to say, he is selling goo.ds of that cause the Government, to all intents and value at a decent profit. No harm would come to him. But if a man has had £100' worth of goods, and has sold them for £300, because the market is bare, or for some other reason, he will have the whole lot taken away. That will be because he cannot show a reasonable rate of profit upon the turnover. For the reasons I have given I believe that we could get over the more serious difficulty by changthe big wholesalers would get rid of their ing the basis for back years of taxation in respect of new capital from a percentage on capital to a percentage on turnover. Under tlie Government proposals we would be doing a very hard, and, to my mind, dangerous thing; but I would be prepared to support those proposals if the position were that some one had been behaving in an improper manner. I desire to refer briefly to a suggestion which has been made several times during the course of this debate. With respect to the pastoral industry, it may be an excellent idea, but as for trading and commercial concerns, the project .is, in my view, one of the most dangerous that could possibly be presented. I refer to the matter of averaging over the war-time period. The war-time profits tax extends over the past three and a half years, and there is only half a year to go. Those profits during that past period have all been made. Every party concerned knows where he is in regard to them. Every one has paid only his first year's taxation. At the time of the commencement of the period covered by the Act, it might have been an excellent plan to include an averaging clause; but to insert it now would mean that every trader who is holding a big stock would take immediate steps to realize. His incentive to do so would be that he would recall that he had made considerable excess profits on which he had not yet been called upon to pay the tax. But he would realize that that payment would be coming due, and he would wonder whether he had not better get out at any price, taking advantage of the protection open to him by way of the averaging prohim to get out of his existing stock bepurposes, would be paying him. would have to pay the tax. sides to that. That man would get the stock more cheaply, but, inevitably, the public would have to pay more for it. If an averaging clause were inserted, all heavy stocks; they would do so in self defence. The goo.ds would get into the hands of the retailers, and, very likely, later on there would be a shortage. The retailers would not see any reason why they should not make the profits open to them. The more seriou3 side is that there would probably be created something like business chaos if an averaging provision were inserted at this stage. Possibly, it would ruin half the small traders. Any one who advocates the insertion at this stage of an averaging clause, when the Act has practically run its course, would be offering a direct incentive to those who were carrying a big stock at high prices to get out, under cover of that averaging clause, at the virtual expense of the Government. And it would be of no benefit to the community at all. I feel strongly that this side of the question should receive consideration. Personally, I cannot quite see the end of the disasters which'might occur if the community were faced with the position of every person and company that carried",87,Poster But The Honori T Must Be Remembered That He Is Depen
460,Mr Riley,The man who buys in,90,Poster But The Honori T Must Be Remembered That He Is Depen
461,Mr Bruce,"Yes; but there are twoheavy stocks clearing them practically at Che expense of the Government. I -would like to see the War-time Profits Act wiped off the statute book, if that were possible. But for the statements of the Treasurer ( Mr as, probably, his neighbour, who might Watt) that there are so many instances of great profiteering going on, and that it would be unfair to the community to repeal the Act at this stage, I would like to see it go altogether. I would prefer that a super-income tax were imposed in its stead. When the measure was first presented in this House, honourable members realized the inequalities and inequities which must exist under it. So far, the Act has been anything but fair in its application to the community generally. I do not wish to go into any great length of detail at this stage, in connection with the amending B ill ; but there is not the slightest doubt that the Treasurer has been listening chiefly to the business people in the cities. They are the folk who, apparently, are to be the most cared for under the amendments now proposed. I cannot understand why the Treasurer has consented to present an amendment which is to have the effect of releasing the jobbers from taxation. A certain section of traders have been living on the necessities of the people. These men have been getting first-hand information and buying up supplies. wholly jobbers. They have no capital; and now they are to be exempt from this form of taxation. I cannot understand why it should be so, and I hope the exemption will not be granted. I desire to speak particularly on behalf of those people who have started out in the pastoral industry during the past five, six, or seven years, and who, up to the commencement of the war, have shown little ornoprofits. I shall give oue instance. A certain individual put a large amount of capital into the pastoral industry. During the whole period, up to the beginning of the war, he showed *a loss each year. 'He did not make interest on his capital, nor was he allowed to charge it in his return. At the beginning of the war he had up to £20,000 invested' in a station. In the first war year he showed a profit of £1,200 Avithout interest on capital. Next year his profits amounted to £4,800. Then that man received notification that he must pay £2,050 by way of ,war-time profits, wherehave made £20,000 that year, would not be called upon to pay a single sixpence. I have given notice of an amendment to provide that any person starting in a business of this sort shall be permitted to make 10 per cent, interest on the capital employed in the pre-war years. A pastoralist is not even allowed to deduct his losses. I have particulars of one pastoralist who in one year lost £788, and in the next year £618. He was anxious to deduct these losses, which had been incurred in the pre-war. years from his total profit of £1,522, but he was not permitted to do so. Honourable members have talked about, traders getting 10 per oent. interest on their business concerns before this tax operates, but no such allowance is made to the pastoralist, and if he does happen to make a small profit during the war period he is not allowed to deduct any losses incurred by him in the three pre-war years. The Taxation Department, in a letter to one pastoralist, dealing with this point, has saidIn reply to your letter of the 16th inst., relative to your claim of allowance of deducThey are solely and tion of the losses of your station, I would point out that, in order that a deduction may be allowed, section 15 (13) requires that the profits of the pre-war years shall have been invested in the business and lost, and that profits of the accounting period shall have been applied in extinction of that loss. As no profits of the pre-war year were invested and lost in thc business, the section is inapplicable. I have the particulars of about eight or ten cases of men who six or seven years ago started in the pastoral industry in. Western Australia, put all their capital and labour into it, and showed no profit until within the last couple of years. The Government now claim 50 per cent, and 75 per cent, of those profits, and the pastoralists are not permitted to deduct their losses. They are told that they can only deduct them out of any profits made in the respective accounting periods, but",90,Poster But The Honori T Must Be Remembered That He Is Depen
462,"Mr Gregory (Dampier) [10,52]","if they made no profits, how can they do so? -other businesses. Why cannot the pastoralist be put on the same footing? The Treasurer has made provision in the last clause of the Bill by which a Board may grant relief where hardship has been occasioned, but why cannotthe same relief be given pastoralists as is given to men in other businesses ? I am not speaking on behalf of pastoralists who have made huge profits, and have a big pre-war standard. ' If such a person has made bigger profits during the war he can well afford' to pay this tax, but surely 95 per cent, to 97 per cent, of mining it must appeal to every one as unjust that a poor man, who has been .battling year after year without showing a profit, should be called upon to give up 50 per cent, and 75 per cent, of the small profit that he has finally managed to secure, and which may only ba a book profit, owing to increase of stock upon which he may never realize, while a man with a big pre-war standard will not be called upon to pay any of this taxation. I hope that in Committee a proper allowance will be made to meet the cases I have mentioned. It should be the duty of the Governmeut to encourage production, but no Government has been so neglectful of the interest of producers. The way in which the primary producers of Australia have been neglected is preposterous. thing seems to be done for the benefit of the business man who is hanging about the city. The way in which people in the bush are treated in regard to postal and ' other facilities is almost criminal. The Government advise men to go out and develop the country, but when they get them there no one seems to care, a rap for them; mittee I hope to be able to go into this probably because they are few in number and their voting power is small. There has been a great deal of talk about the metal industry. The Government have a proposal in the Bill to grant relief to mining companies by proclamation. Relief from this taxation has been asked by tin miners, lead miners, and others. They have urged that it should be given in regard to new mines. They have not asked for total exemptions, but simply that a pre-waT standard of the value of their product .should be fixed, as against a war standard, and These deductions are allowed in an. allowance made for the increased cost of production, after which the 50 per cent, and 75 per cent, payment should be claimed by the Treasury. On my last visit to Western Australia. I inspected some lead mines 80 miles from Geraldton. They are marvellously rich, but it is absolutely impossible to induce people to invest capital in them for the purpose of developing them, when the only advantage that they could rely on under this tax would be an allowance of 10 per cent, on the capital invested. Approximately shows have proved to be dead failures. Mining is the most speculative of all industries. What applies in the case of ordinary business does not apply to mining, more particularly mining for base metals. Eor the last twelve or eighteen months relief has been sought in. connection with new mines, and now we find that the Governor in Council is to proclaim exemptions in certain directions. If the Government cannot make up their minds, now what relief should be granted, how will they be in a position to' do so in the future? I ask for no favours in any particular direction that cannot be given in other directions If the Government would only allow people to win back from the products of the mines they deEveryvelop the money put into them before any taxation is imposed, the position would not be so bad. Either this should be done or the Government should accept the proposal to fix a pre-war standard of value, and make an allowance for the increased cost of production, taking its percentage of the balance. When we get into Commatter more fully. I trust that some better explanation will be given for exempting brokers. When everybody else is to be asked to pay this special war-time taxation I cannot understand why jobbers or brokers are tobeexempted. I have heard a great deal about a snumber of these people who have been living on the necessities of the community. There are men who have been' making a 'living by ascertaining where there is a scarcity of any commodity and by getting special information in regard to shipping which has enabled them to buy up certain products and export them. In this way they have made enormous profits Yet they are to be exempted from this taxation. I shall do my best to prevent that, more particularly when I find how unequal the taxation is in regard to . many other persons engaged in different industries. If I had my way I would remove this legislation from the statute-book altogether, and impose a super-income tax. It is most unfair to some people, particularly those starting in new businesses such as I have mentioned, and to men who have had bad times on their stations, and are now making a little profit. It is not right that they should be compelled to pay from 50 per cent, to 75 per cent, of their profits now, while others who have been making huge profits during the last ten or fifteen years, and are making no greater profits nOw, should not be called upon to contribute anything under this tax. There are men and companies making probably £100,000 a year now, and, because they have that big pre-war standard, with similar profits in the past, they are not compelled to pay a single 6d. under this tax. It is the inequity of the measure that I do not like. But now we have it , and I suppose must continue it for a time. I do hope that some effort will be made by the Government to meet the views of those who are trying to protect the people who are developing our primary industries. If that effort is made the Government will have my assistance. If it is not I am sure an attempt w ill be made to grant some relief to those people on whose behalf I bave been speaking. not want to appear as opposing the B ill altogether, because, as an amending measure, it certainly gives some relief that was badly needed. But , on the other hand, it inflicts a hardship which more than compensates for any little advantage the Government may be offering to the community. If the Act had to be passed de novo, I would point out that the result of the tax has been to restrict industry in every way, to lessen employment, and to k ill revenue. surer the point that the measure was in tended to raise revenue, and that he could not afford to give it up. But I believe the real effect of the B ill , so far, has been actually to k ill revenue by preventing men from going into business, and getting the due reward for their industry. We are paying a very big price in not having industries established which would have been established if this tax had not been imposed. The clauses relating to new businesses certainly give some relief, but I am surprised to find that some clauses are not included which I certainly expected to find in any amending B ill . The first is the clause dealing w i th tttie average fcyff profits over the years during which tliis tax is to be collected. From the point of view of the pastoralist fchat is almost an essential, and I should have thought that the Government, who are supported by country members generally, would realize tlie position of the pastoralist who has his lean years as well as his plentiful years, the lean years, for the most part, more than counterbalancing the good ones. I expected them to give some consideration to the suggestion that an effort should be made to enable the man who made, a loss in one year to balance it against the succeeding or preceding good year. But what I particularly want is an alteration in the way of fixing 10 per cent as the pre-war standard. The Government have not altered in any way the accounting period which has been fixed as the pre-war standard on which the profits are estimated. As a consequence they have perpetuated that injustice upon a good many firms whose accounting period did not end u n t i l a month or I do two after the 4th August, 1914. They should still take that into account, and allow those firms whose accounting period ended in September or October, 1914, to take into their accounting period those aix or twelve months. That was an in justice under the old Act, but, under this B ill , the injustice is accentuated, because the capital they had at the accounting period previous to August, 1914, is taken into account in fixing the pre-war standard, and not the The Treacapital they actually had on 4th August( MrW a t t ) has accentuated of that year, when the war broke out.",91,Poster But The Honori T Must Be Remembered That He Is Depen
463,Mr Leckie ( I N D I ) [ 1 1 . 7 ],"Unless this clause is withdrawn, hundreds of firms will l e badly hit under this Bill. ' The retrospective action of the measure, as at present drawn, seems to carry ' it beyond the scope of legitimate parliamentary taxation. The Government told the community that they were going to tax excess profits during war time, and some of the people, though hardly hit, went on building up their businesses on the assumption that they were to be taxed on those lines, and they cheerfully paid the amount at which they were assessed. But the Government now say that they are not going to tax on those lines at all, and the men who have expended their profits in buying machinery and extending their businesses to give employment find, at the end. of this period, after they have dispersed their profits either in dividends or in advancing their businesses, that an extra tax is put upon them. They will be called on to pay very large sums in some cases, which they did not expect to' pay, ' and had not provided for. more difficult to extract the last shilling than the last man. the Minister wants to extract the last shilling from those firms who are providing the cash whereby this country is to be run-fro m the businesses which, after all, will have to provide funds to meet the inevitably large expenditure which'the Government will have to bear. The clause regarding the -10 per cent, acts in a most peculiar way. In a case where, instead of a pre-war standard, the / 10 per oent. standard is brought in, a firm that was making 15 per. cent, on its capital, and ' doubled its capital during the interval, is allowed to make a profit of only 13$ per cent, in.stead of 15 per cent. hand, a man who has decreased his capital is allowed to make nearly 17 per cent, on the capital employed, and in addition he can invest the capital he has actually withdrawn from his business in war loans or in some other way) thus making nearly as much money as he earned with the extra capital in his business. So the man who' decreases his capital gains under this B ill , ' and the man who has progressed and increased his capital is penalized. I hope that before the B ill goes through Committee the Government will see that they are doing a very grave injustice to individuals and firms. They are also doing a grave injustice to Australia, because they are killing the very things they ought to encourage, and killing the very employment we need to provide for the soldiers who are just returning. When the Bill went through last year, it was after all-night sittings, when members were fagged.
