Muiow, from the Prime Minister, whether his .attention has been called to a statement in this morning's Argus .headed, "" Spies in Australia: Remarkable disclosures: German and Japanese."" According to that stateiment, Mr A. G. Taylor, secretary to the -conference of the Australian local government engineers, and captain in the Intelligence Corps of the Commonwealth Military Forces, says that a distinguished Japanese -officer was recently discovered making surveys of several vulnerable points on the >coast of New South Wales, and that a company of Germans was arrested while making surveys and plotting plans at Prospect, near Sydney. I ask whether there is any truth tin the statements, and, if so, whether the iright honourable gentleman will consider the .advisableness of applying to this country, for its protection, the laws which Germany and Japan apply to foreigners in cases of -espionage ? -question has just been asked by the honourable member for Hunter. The Honorary (Minister asked that notice be given of it, presumably because he thinks the matter of some importance. I attach no importance jfco the statements. pearing in last night's Herald, it was stated that only Australian artists who are *in London will have an opportunity to compete for the commissions for the historical portraits which are to be acquired by the -Commonwealth, and I ask the Prime Minister, on behalf of our artists who are -struggling to earn a miserable pittance in this part of the world, which is not an art -centre, if it is intended to prevent them from competing for what will be the prizes of the artistic world ? -.statement appeared in the Herald. A 1 Board has been appointed, and most of the paintings will be made by Australian artists living in this country; but some of them will be made oversea, because the subjects to be painted are not in Australia, and Australian artists living in London will get that work. Honourable members know that the number of portraits to be painted in Australia is much greater than the number to be painted elsewhere. If the representatives of the newspapers will inquire, they will get all the particulars in matters of this kind. Minister of External Affairs, if he has considered the advisability of purchasing scenes painted by Australian artists, to be placed in the offices of the High Commissioner in London. considered. following paper :Maternity Allowance Act-Forms of Applications and Certificates. the Minister of External Affairs to bring the officials of the Northern Territory under the Public Service Act, so that they may be available for service in any part of Australia, and capable of being transferred to other places? the Government to introduce a Bill for the control of the public servants of the Northern Territory, and the phase of the matter referred to will be considered when the measure is being drafted. ternal Affairs aware that a party of miners in the Northern Territory are threatening to jump the Government mine?

O'Reilly referred, at a meeting of the jubilee celebrations committee, to the delay in supplying the cadets at St. Stanislaus' College with uniforms. He said that, some time ago-the exact date had been lost in the twilight of fable-the college boys had been measured for a cadet outfit. Up to date, however, they had only received uniforms for half the boys, and there did not appear to be any immediate possibility of getting the remainder. In the meantime, some had died, some had left the college, and some had married, and by the time the last uniform was delivered he would be underground. I wish to know whether anything is being here while they are working? done to supply uniforms to cadets? heard of such an astonishing statement from any reverend gentleman.

Sydney is a purely manufacturing and industrial community, and has, from the inception of Federation, included the municipalities of Botany and Mascotte. Both municipal councils have carried resolutions protesting against the alteration that has been made. A body of 3,400 in one of these municipalities has been added to the electorate of Cook. This transfer, they say, they do not desire. They do not wish to break off their connection with the South Sydney district, and they protest against this alteration. Residents at the other end of Botany object to being bracketed with Randwick, which is a purely residential 1 I cannot see the foggiest shadow district. There is certainly no community of interest between the two places, and I have been asked consequently to voteagainst the acceptance of the present redisAnd perhaps tribution, with a view to securing the maintenance of the present community of interest between Botany and Mascotte, and also to try to prevent part of the Randwick district being added to the electorate.

81,Mr Riley (South Sydney) [11.14],"departure from the principle of one vote one value. My contention is that, within 1,000 or so, the number of electors in country and metropolitan constituencies should be alike. It is certainly wrong that there should be more than 5,000 electors in each of the metropolitan constituencies than there are in many of the country electorates. In the redistribution scheme for Victoria, recognition was given to the principle of one vote one value. the country electorates, is practically up to that of the city constituencies. Cowper and Richmond, for instance, have nearly as many electors as are in any city electorate. mistaken; they have only some 30,000 or 32,000 electors. tors in Cowper. between 5,000 and 6,000 more electors in every metropolitan constituency than there are in any country constituency. Such differentiation should not be recognised as a principle. Nepean says that, whilst his constituency is practically a country one, the number of electors which it comprises is well up to the city limit. In other words, the Commissioners could not place more than 40,000 electors in any electorate, and in the electorate of Nepean there are 37,000 electors; so that they have gone very close up to the limit. I do not blame the Commissioners; I think they have done their best, but they ought to take notice of objections lodged by members and municipalities. Had they adopted some of the suggestions made by the people interested, or shown any desire to meet their views, I should have been satisfied. We should send back this scheme, with a view to the elimination of some of the anomalies, and securing a fair deal for all when the elections come round. the Commissioners did not consider the suggestions ? objections, but they have not adopted any of them. partisans lodge objections. were advanced for one or two slight alterations which were suggested, and the adoption of ' which would have preserved the existing community of interest without injuring any one. Under the circumstances, I shall vote to send back this scheme to the Commissioners. The redistribution does not affect me, but surely, when we believe that there are anomalies in the scheme, we should send it back in order that they may be rectified. I have invariably noted that those honourable members who are least in sympathy with the democratic principles of our institutions are those who boast most of their Democracy. The honourable member for Indi this morning made some rather senseless remarks in reply to the honourable member for Wentworth. as to the importance of redistributing the Commonwealth divisions from time to time, when the number of electors in certain districts outgrows that of their neighbours. The honourable member for Wentworth's constituency has grown, I think, to 48,000. The original quota was 27,000. My own has grown to 47,000 or 48,000. That of the .honourable member for North Sydney has grown with equal rapidity. According to the honorThe honourable member for able member for Indi, who is one of the most blatant Democrats in this HouseI use the word blatant as indicating boastful-ther e should be no redistribution at all. I should like to know how that attitude is reconciled with the cry about one man one vote, which we have been hearing for years. Themen who wanted one man one vote do not now like it. We know very well that the general outcome of one man one vote, subject to the differing growths of constituencies in a young country like Australia, was this : That, at the last election, although the party, which sits on the Ministerial side, came back with a majority of eleven members in this House, the aggregate representation of the units making up that majority gave thema majority of only 14,000 people. That is to say, 14,000 people in the whole Commonwealth gave them a majority of eleven members in this House; it handed over the destinies of this country to the management of a party which had so little of a majority, .that I have heard it estimated by other authorities at only 3,000. orable member nofc.

I only want to emphasize the point that the most undemocratic people in regard to our political life are those who boast most of their honourable member for South Sydney. They Democracy. Notwithstanding that it was demonstrated again and again, by Electoral Commissioners and by public reports emanating from officers under the present Government, that some constituencies have grown from 27,000 to 48,000 voters, there are plenty of honourable members opposite who say in effect:4 ""Well, we like things as they are; they have secured a majority of eleven for us in this House, and we would like them to stay in the position' to which they have grown."" In other words, some honourable members, representing, perhaps, 25,000 people, would like to have the same representation in this supposed democratic assemblage as those who represent a constituency of 47,000 or 50,000. not practise it. Whenever in my political history a democratic proposal has come before Parliament, I think that a reference to Hansard will show that I voted for it. I voted for women's suffrage twenty-two years ago, before some honourable members opposite thought about it ; and in every democratic movement I have, I think, been quite consistent. I recognised that there should be redistribution when the seats were changed last time. I recognise it now. member is square against the Toryism of the other side. hope, square against everything. merely wish to protest at this stage of my .remarks against the frequent indications on the other side of a desire to let things stay as they are. orable members opposite are the Conservatives; they are the Tories; they are the un-Democratic party in this country; and if you want Democracy and a desire for equality you have to come to this side of the House. Whatever our personal opinions may be, we must recognise the fact that the three Commissioners appointed to do this work are in the nature of specialists. We are all specialists when we can give sufficient time to a subject to understand it better than our neighbours. These men were .especially qualified to investigate this matter. They know the principles which should guide them. They have not worked on an isolated principle as to whether a particular thing suits a particular class, such as one section in the constituency of the have devoted weeks and weeks to the work. They know there should be something like an equal division of. electors. They know that the work should be done without bias. I do not think that any one could for a moment think that there has been any bias on the part of the men appointed for this work. Commissioners in the different States have redistributed the whole Commonwealth. I should like to know which one of us, taking' the circumstances of his own constituency-of which perhaps we know more than of any other-is in a position to say that the work has not been properly done? I can understand a little dissatisfaction. I may feel a little bit) dissatisfied with my own constituency in I do one or two particulars, because I know that talk about Democracy, but I the Commissioners have taken out of it a large section in which I was very sure of getting very wide support, and have added to it another section member will have to fight. another suburb in which I am prepared to fight; and I hope that I shall meet the honourable member on the border and look at him from over the fence. But I do not go whining about the House saying that I do not like it ; I do not go crying out COOK -The honourable about these men, and saying that they are unfit' for their work. I do not' say that the people of Petersham protest against this distribution, because they have been my conI stituents in the past, nor do I say that the people of Leichhardt protest because they have been brought into the constituency. I recognise that the Commissioners have folHonlowed the principles which it is acknowledged should guide them in dividing electorates, and I am prepared to take my chance. I know that they have been guided by public convenience and public advantage, whilst my isolated views, and the isolated views of other honourable members, might be affected by personal convenience.

I said that, so far as Victoria was concerned, there was no justificaback to an event which occurred in Sydney tion for the proposed redistribution; and events have proved my contention. Several honourable members upon the opposite side of the House, as well as upon this side of it, have, during the last few months-sinc e the Victorian redistribution took placeasked the Minister of Home Affairs to explain why there is a serious discrepancy between the census returns and our electoral rolls? Every honourable member is aware that a great many names appear on our electoral-rolls which are not accounted for on the census returns. As the Victorian redistribution is based upon the census returns, I take it that my interjection was to Henry Parkes and myself advocated dethe point. able member is now going beyond a personal explanation. member for Parkes did not hear my interjection, otherwise he would not have made the remarks which he did. able member is now going beyond a personal explanation. was based on a number of questions which have been put to the Minister of Home Affairs in regard to the discrepancy disclosed between our electoral rolls and the census returns.

At any rate, I shall do my best. My memory carries me some years ago when the late Sir George Grey delivered an address in the Town Hall on Democracy. On that occasion he strongly urged the then infant Labour movement to adopt the principle of one man one vote, or adult suffrage, as the forefront of its fighting programme. It . followed his wise advice. But it did not secure the enactment of democratic legislation without having to face a great deal of opposition, and certainly thafc opposition did not emanate from the side of the House upon which I sat. mocratic legislation twenty-two years ago not a member of the Labour party supported us. party was not then born. The Government _ deserve to be congratulated on the selection which they made of men to act as Commissioners to redistribute the electoral divisions of New South Wales. The work of those Commissioners has been exceedingly well done, especially if we compare it with the work done by the Commissioners appointed for a similar purpose in other States, notably, in Western Australia, and, to a lesser degree, in Queensland. sioners did their work excellently. amended their original scheme, and the fact that this House adopted the amended scheme is a fair indication that it constituted an improvement upon the original redistribution. The work of redistributing the electoral divisions of a State is a very difficult and intricate one. : Wales Commissioners have given their work very careful consideration, and distribution of which, on the whole, they need not be ashamed.

This was noticed especially in division. It is now to be transferred to connection with the redistribution for the the Darling division. Having been inti1906 elections.

The present arrangement means that division, and I have been associated with the country seats generally are extended them on friendly terms ever since, and reover a greater area. If honourable members gret the severance from them. The districts of Peak Hill, Bimbi, the Barrier electorate was enlarged in 1906, Barmedman, Temora, and Grenfell reand the greater extent to which it is being corded 3,301 votes for me at the last enlarged to-day, they will realize how the election, and gave 2,715 votes to my principle has operated. But this enlargeopponent, but Wellington, Stuarttown, and ment is, I suppose, inseparable from the Orange, which were in the divisions fair and just application of the principle of Robertson and Macquarie, and are of giving to every vote as nearly as posto be added to the new Calare division, cast sible its one value. As an exponent of 3,226 votes for the Labour candidate and that principle I cannot feel myself called 5,566 against him, so that the strength of upon to sacrifice it for the disadvantages the two parties in the division is practically of country representation which are brought unaffected by the new arrangement. My about by this complete application. only regret is at ceasing a long and close connection with the divisions I have named. I have no word of condemnation, but a is a possibility of some amendments being word of commendation, for the way in made which would give more complete which the Commissioners have carried out expression. to the principle of community Unfortunately, ever since the very severe financial set-back in the early I 2 As a two seats. The old Canobolas electorate, Honourable J. C. Watson represented, were will note the extent to which, for instance, Looking at the scheme before the House from a local stand-point it seems that there of interest. Take, for instance, the Werriwa electorate. At present the Great Southern railway runs pretty well through the centre of the electorate, and it is only reasonable to suppose that the very existence of the line makes for community of interesta feeling which could not be brought about by any other circumstance. Looking at the subdivision, we find that the Eden-Monaro electorate cuts in upon the Werriwa electorate, and cuts across the trunk railway between Goulburn and Harden and-Murrumburra, and that a number of towns, such as Yass, and a lot of small towns like Galong are taken from their present relationship with Werriwa, which has existed ever since Federation, and added to what was the far-away electorate of Eden-Monaro. That, it seems to me, cuts directly across the grain of the principle of common interest. No conditions have arisen in the meanwhile which make the interests of these people more closely connected with the interests of the main centres of Eden and Monaro rather than with the interests of the main centres of the old Werriwa electorate. To compensate for this particular loss, Werriwa is extended eastward so as to embrace a considerable number of electors lying east of Goulburn, in the directorates and the substitution of further citytion of Moss vale, who originally were included in the Illawarra division. Now the Eden-Monaro electorate extends considerably over the old Illawarra electorate, and it seems to me that there should be no greater infringement of the principle of a common interest if this portion of the electorate were added to Eden-Monaro, rather than that an interruption should be made by the extension of that electorate over that part of the old Werriwa electorate lying between Goulburn and Harden. If that was thought to be the case, it could, I think, be re-adjusted' without calling for any drastic alteration of the general scheme submitted by the Commissioners. Again, take the electorate of Nepean. Its representative holds that the community of interest should embrace a larger section of the Parramatta division than at present rather than the agricultural arealying north. If that beso-and I am not prepared to say that it is, because my knowledge of the local conditions is not sufficiently intimate a re-arrangement could, I think, he made, and a greater community of interest secured thereby without a drastic change of the whole Mr Thomas Brown. scheme. If that could be secured, I , for one, should not object to the scheme being, sent, back to the Commission-for the purpose of having these minor alterationsmade. Buti f it is to involve a drastic change of the whole scheme, then I do notsee that the country interests, which should, receive some consideration, are to be benefited more by any other change of the scheme which is possible as compared, with that which is submitted. I am in a difficulty. I-realize that the work of the Commissioners has been of such a clear, fair,, and impartial character that it can only claim from me commendation instead of condemnation. On the other hand, I< recognise that what has been advanced bysome honourable members in the way of minor details might lead to a fairer adjustment of the matter, of community of interest, and for that reason only I shall beprepared to consent to the scheme being, sent back to the Commissioners for furtherconsideration. Buti f it is to involve a drasticchange of electorates, which would meam practically a repetition of what took placein 1906-the elimination of country elecelectorates-I , for one, although I yield' to no man in my desire to see the principleof equality of voting power maintained, shall not be prepared to support a drasticchange of that character as against the fair and moderate proposal now before the House.

I am aware that honourable members are charged sometimes with discussing these motions according as the scheme proposed suits themselves or does not. If I were this morning to follow that course I should vote for the redistribution proposed. I know that the honourable member for Parramatta is connected with an association which would be very pleased if the proposed scheme were rejected, notwithstanding the fact that it is likely that honourable members opposite will vote for it. The Hercules who is to be brought forth against myself to pull down the Labour flag in Riverina was to have been selected on the 15th of this month, but it was felt that it would be useless to offer any opposition to me if the redistribution scheme now submitted were given effect, and the selection of the Opposition candidate was therefore postponed until the close of this month in the hope that some alteration might be made in the scheme. I am here, not as an individual, but as a representative of the electors of my constituency, and I have to inform the House, as the Commissioners have already been informed, that 7,000 electors who are taken from the original district of Riverina, and included in the dissideration in arranging the boundaries of / trict of Barrier, have protested against the proposed redistribution, and with very good reason. municipal or other public body in the area proposed to be taken from the Riverina district that has not sent in a strongly, but respectfully, worded protest to the Commissioners. They have also made suggestions which the Commissioners have made no attempt to meet. some of the Commissioners, and have not a word to say against any of them personally, but I am at a loss to understand why they have not recognised that they had not, and could not, obtain as much knowledge of the conditions of the different districts of New South Wales as is possessed by honourable, members representing those districts. It was their duty to confer in some way with, the members representing the district in order to obtain the fullest information as to the conditions prevailing in them. But these Commissioners have accepted no suggestion. When the New South Wales districts were first arranged, there was only one Commissioner appointed for the task. He sent out notifications to every member of the Parliament, arid to all public bodies throughout the States, asking that suggestions should be sent in to him, or that he should be waited upon. He took every means open to him to arrive at an equitable conclusion in the interests of the whole community with the result that his scheme of distribution, though not whollyacceptable, was agreed to by Parliament without demur.. I have had time only toglance at the scheme now before the House,, and, strange to say, I was not supplied, as I think honourable members ought to be, with a copy of the report of the Commissioners or plans of the proposed redistribution. I should say that some weeks ago I got a plan which was sent back to the Commissioners. It is unfair to honourable: members and their constituents that they; should not be supplied with this information. I ask honourable members to follow; what is proposed in connection with theRiverina district. The Commissioners statein their report that they have given dueconsideration to the two essential principles, laid down in the Act-communit y of in-terests, and means of communication. What' did we understand "" community of interest"" to mean when we passed the Act?"" It surely was that the chief commercial or industrial interests were to be given conan electorate; that where the mining interest prevailed it should be conserved, and There is not a shire council, in the same way where the agricultural or pastoral interest predominated regard"" should be had to that fact in fixing the boundaries. What is meant by "" means of communication "" ?

Under the scheme submitted, the Broken Hill electorate will include such towns as Balranald, Moulamein, Barham, Moama, Mathoura, Deniliquin, and others which have no community of interest whatever with Broken Hill, and there are no means of communication between them. tor in the southern part of the new district of Barrier desired to reach the centre of the electorate, he would have to travel down to Melbourne first, from Melbourne to Adelaide, and thence to Broken Hill, a distance of between 1,000 and 2,000 miles. Such a distribution is clearly absurd on the face of it, and I am absolutely amazed that the Commissioners should expect honourable members, whose duty it is to do justice to the electors, to accept it. If I were to consider my own interests, I should prefer the scheme to remain as it is, but I could not, in justice to the people whom I have so long represented, support its adoption. Due regard has not been paid either to community of interest or means of communication. Broken Hill and the neighbouring country comprise purely mining centres. There are a few squatters, but the whole country is mineral in character, and mining predominates. Community of interest would be secured by going eastwards and taking off portion of the Darling country, which includes mining districts necessary. The Commissioners could then have taken off the north portion of Riverina which comprises such mining districts as Mount Hope and Gilgunnia, and between that portion and the northern portion of Riverina community of interest would undoubtedly be secured. As to means of communication between that area and State Parliament has approved of the construction of a railway from Condobolin to BrokenH ill ; so that such an alteration as I have suggested would secure community of interest and pay due regard to means of communication. As it is, the Commissioners have removed 7,000 electors from one side of the existing electorate of Riverina and added 6,000 from an elecwith a more remarkable proposition. If honourable members examine the boundaries of the proposed new electorate, they will admit that 49,000 spiders could not have drawn a more intricate map. At the present time, the only means of communication between Broken Hill and portion of the electorate of Riverina, which has been attached to that constituency, is vid Melbourne and Adelaide. During certain parts of the year, it is impossible to get If , under this scheme, an electhrough, even by motor car. When there is a heavy rainfall in the Darling River country, the roads are so bad that a motor car would be bogged, and it would be difficult even to reach Broken Hill from this point by means of horses -and vehicles. Were we in earnest when we declared that in making a redistribution of electorates full consideration should be given to community of interest and means"" of communication? What possible community of interest can there be between the people in the Riverinaportion of the electorate of Broken Hill and Broken Hill itself? The people of Riverina are not miners, but agriculturists and pastoralists, so that their commercial' centre is southward, and not northward.

I pointed out that some of the members of the Labour party opposed that motion, and that I supported it. The honourable member for Calare, who followed me, drew the attention of the House to the fact that Sir George Grey, who came to this country during the sittings of the convention on Federation in 1891, had recommended the Labour party to turn their attention to adult suffrage, and he said that I , with others, and the party to which I belong, opposed that movement. I am sure that the honourable member is not aware of the facts of the case. Turning to the that Sir Henry Parkes, on the 30th JulyI do not think my honourable of that year, moved the following motionThat, in the opinion of this House, the franchise for the election of members of the Legislative Assembly should be extended to women on As there is so the same conditions and subject to the same disqualifications as those imposed by law upon male electors.

I find that no fewer than ten Labour members who were at. that time members of the New South Wales Parliament voted against Sir Henry Parkes' motion. Question resolved in fhe negative. Debate resumed (vide page 4934). When the debate on this subject was interrupted, I was dealing with the objections lodged against the distribution of New South Wales by my constituents, on the ground of want of community of interest and means of communication. Of course, it is not possible for honourable members to become acquainted with all the leading features of States which they do not represent, but they have a certain amount of knowledge of the geographical conditions of this country. Now Deniliquin is, and has been for all time, looked upon as the centre of Riverina. There is no question that it is the centre. The constituency derives its name from the fact that it embraces a large part of the river system, including the Murray, the Murrumbidgee, the Lachlan, and other streams. Deniliquin has also been the electoral centre of Riverina. Now, however, not only the centre, but the country for something like 45 miles east of the centre has been taken out Of the Riverina electorate and added on to the Barrier, better known as Broken -Hill. What has become of Riverina? The Commissioners have practically put Riverina out of Riverina altogether. Deniliquin is a very important town. It includes some thousands of inhabitants. It has community of interest southward. It has means of communication with Melbourne by means of a railway. Other parts of the Tocumwal district also have means of communication with Melbourne. They use Melbourne commercially and in other senses. But their community of interest with other parts of the Riverina electorate is to be totally disregarded. Repetition is tedious, but one or two facts cannot be too strongly impressed upon honourable members. When the West Australian redistribution was under consideration, it was different parts of one electorate, and that that was a feature which ought to have been considered by the Commissioners. The result was that the scheme was sent back to the Commissioners, and they were madeaware of what the opinions of the members of this House were. was the Senate that rejected the original) West Australian scheme. of this Parliament, representing the sameconstituents. The fact remains; whether the objection emanated from this House or from another place is not material. What is material is that the facts placed beforeParliament by the honourable member representing the constituency chiefly affected* were taken into consideration by the verysame Commissioners. missioners. The principal Commissioner had gone away on a holiday, and had to be replaced by another man. in error; but, at all events, the scheme wassent back to the Commissioners, at least: two of whom had had to do with the original division. They gave consideration rothe statements made in Parliament, and restored the electors of the constituency chiefly concerned to the community of interest of which they had been previously deprived. My constituents ask me to puttheir case as forcibly as I can. They point: out that they will suffer, under this scheme^ a very serious injustice. With all due respect to the Minister, they say that they will be practically disfranchised. It will be useless for them to take any part in thepolitical development of Australia. Politically they will be cut off, and they will"" also be deprived of their means of communication. Can any man who can divest himself of party feeling look at the proposed redistribution and say that it is a fair one? A glance at the map will show that the whole of the western portion of New South Wales from the Queensland border to Tocumwal, within 180 miles of Melbourne, is to be thrown into one electorate in which the mining interests must predominate because of the population which is centred in Broken Hill. This schemewill result in the disfranchisement of 7,000electors. It is manifestly unjust. If I ' merely desired to represent an electorate in*",29,Supply Formal

172,Mr Austin Chapman (Eden,"we had to consider that only, the honourable member has made out a good case. But I cannot at all approve of the suggestion fchat the Commissioners should have started from Sydney and worked outwards, because that would have meant the loss of two country seats, a thing to be deplored. I hope the House will accept the boundaries as suggested by the Commissioners, who seem to me to have had a very difficult task to perform. What is the use of having non-political Commissioners if a majority of the House can send back reports and really control the redistribution? It is idle to say that party feeling does not enter into these matters. Wait until the division bell rings! The Minister of External Affairs has told us that the Government will support the proposals of the Commissioners; and when the bell rings we shall see what that support means. From an interjection by the honourable member for Parramatta, we might be led to think that even some of the Ministers will not vote in support of 'the Commissioners' report. That is not the way for a Government, and especially a strong Government, to back up proposals of the kind. the Commissioners are wrong, they ought all to vote against the recommendations.^ I see no necessity for the Government to vote as a body on such a question. think that the proposed redistribution is not a proper one, they should not propose its adoption. should not be made a Government proposal; and if the Government decide to make it a Ministerial question, they should not be open to the suspicion of absenting themselves when the vote is taken. should prefer to see Ministers divided on the question, because it is very unfair to make it a party matter. I believe that the best has been done by the Commissioners, who have considered community of interest as far as possible. After all, community of interest in the Commonwealth and community of interest in a State are two different things. It would be very difficult to form an electorate representing all mining or all commercial interests, at any rate, in a big State like New South Wales. We cannot all discuss this matter from the high stand-point taken by the honourable member for Riverina. If I thought my electorate was so divided that I was sure to be returned, I would not rise and suggest that it should be altered to suit other interests, and I congratulate the honourable member for Riverina on being able to take such a stand. There is a lot of human nature amongst us, and we take an individual view of the question. We ask how the division suits ourselves, then how it suits the party, and then how it suits the country-that , in my opinion, is the order in which these matters are generally considered. national stand-point"" ? "" broad national stand-point "" generally comes last, in my opinion. If we refer this report back, it will be almost certain, as I said, that two seats will be lost to the country and given to the city. The trend of population to the city is a curse of civilization, and it ought to be prevented as far as possible. The Commissioners, if the report be referred to them again, will have nothing to guide them but what is being said by honourable members on the present occasion. course, and they come from all sides of the House. The honourable member for Calare, dealing with my electorate instead of his own, said there was nothing in common between Queanbeyan and Eden-Monaro. We all know that Yass is part of the Queanbeyan district, and that there is constant communication and business relations between them, proposed railway to connect Yass, Queanbeyan, and Jervis Bay, will create greater community of interest; and, under all the circumstances, I do not see that there could I be a better redistribution than that made by the Commissioners. In the event of our referring the report back, the Commissioners might submit a second scheme with which we could not agree; and then, of course, there would be no time to deal with the matter this session. sent back a dozen times, if necessary. think that the scheme is a just one. The old boundaries would suit me just as well, and I should be prepared to trust to them again. Riverina ?",31,Electoral Divisions New South Wales

They have very sensibly gone north, and brought in centres of population that are identical in interest with those previously in the electorate. It is, therefore, surprising to me to hear honourable members who know nothing of my electorate endeavouring to show that the Commissioners should have made a wiser redistribution. Such arguments make one suspect that they are prompted by reasons other than a desire for the good of the country. The Commissioners have done well.

But most honourable members have a little human' nature in them, and are prepared to look after their own district interests. districts do if they lost a member ? who represent country electorates fight for what they consider will best suit the country.

202,Mr Carr (Macquarie) [2.40],"I shalUno desire to impute motives to the Commissioners. I am inclined to think that, having taken into consideration the whole of the circumstances, they accepted the current view that country districts should have a larger proportionate representation than the metropolitan districts. That is certainly the current view, but it is based on superficial reasoning. The honourable member for Parkes, however, did not raise that point; he simply asserted that the Commissioners had, as far as possible, conserved ihe principle of one vote one value. Age, of recent date, published certain figures, which I have checked and found to be substantially accurate. It pointed out thatAn analysis of the proposed redistribution of the electoral divisions of New South Wales discloses the interesting fact that while the average enrolment in the sixteen country electorates is just over 32,000, it is over 37,000 in each of the eleven divisions in the metropolitan and submetropolitan area. In other words, 523,069 electors in the country are to elect sixteen members to the House of Representatives, while the remaining 412,675 people on the rolls are to be given eleven representatives. The discrepancy, therefore, as between country electors and city electors is about 110,000 in favour of the rural electorates. Allowing eleven representatives for an equal number of electors in country and city constituencies, we find that there is a surplus of five representatives for the' 110,000 electors in the country districts, or one representative for approximately every 22,000 electors, a number considerably below the minimum allowed by the Constitution. Clearly, there is not an equal adjustment of voting power. Sixteen representatives are to represent 523,000 electors, and eleven to represent 412,000. That being so, the country districts have five more representatives than have the city districts; which means that, if we allow the same number of representatives for the same number of people in city and country, we have five surplus representatives for the country representing 110,000 electors, or one representative for approximately every; 22,000 electors. That is not in accordance with the principle of one vote one value. I submit these figures to the honourable member for Parkes as a reason why he should vary his decision in this matter. If he desires to stand for true democratic sentiment, above all party bias, let him vote for a better distribution than that now before us. We have, in each of the country electorates, from Mr Carr. 31,000 to 35,000 electors. In only one country constituency-the electorate of Cowper are there 35,000 electors. Most of them contain only 31,000 electors. Robertson has only 31,000, Riverina 32,000, Richmond nearly 34,000, New England 32,000, Macquarie nearly 32,000, Hunter 34,000, Hume 31,000, Gwydir 33,000, Eden-Monaro 31,000, Darling 30,000, Cowper 35,000, Barrier 29,000, Illawarra 34,000, Calare 31,000 The tell us what were the old boundaries of those electorates? what were the boundaries. We are now dealing with a proposal which is designed to fairly adjust the representation of New South Wales. My argument is that the proposed redistribution will not achieve that object. The division of Nepean contains 37,000 electors, West Sydney 37,000, Wentworth 37,000, South Sydney 37,000, Parramatta 37,000, Parkes nearly 38,000, North Sydney 38,000, Lang 38,000, East Sydney 38,000, Dalley 38,000, Cook 38,000, and Newcastle 35,000. Under the proposed redistribution the city voter will not have the same power as will the country voter. I know there is a tendency for honourable members to argue that the city elector should not have equal power With the country elector, because of the sparse population of the country. I consider that that is superficial reasoning. The congestion of our cities is one of those evils which will work its own cure. The electors in our cities are more apt to cast a Liberal vote in regard to land legislation than are the electors of the country, and so open outlets that will ease congestion. We can hope for more democratic representation from the congested areas in our cities, where they feel the pinch, than we can from the country. I disclaim any desire to interfere with the Commissioners who are responsible for the scheme. I believe that they have accepted the common view, and so far as their judgment guided them they have done their work well. They have managed to cut up New -South Wales in such a way that that State will not lose a representative. The total representation of New South Wales will not be affected by the proposed redistribution. to appeal to the country on the existing electoral boundaries.",34,Chapman Thi S Thus Showing Community Of Interest The

The question of an extra representative for New South Wales is not at stake at all. New South Wales is not entitled to an additional member, nor is she due to lose a representative. But there are local considerations which ought not to be a negligible quantity in our determination of this matter. There is the question of community of interest, for example. Of course, I can speak with more authority in regard to my own electorate than I can in regard to other areas. In the proposed Macquarie division some thousands of men are engaged in the mining and in other secondary industries, but on the broad plains of that electorate very little industrial work is carried on. There are no large industrial centres there. centrated on the mountains, and the grouping of the two interests will result in a clash of feeling and in the' flouting of local sentiment which we are entitled to regard. is no community of interest between the Macquarie plains and the mining towns which it is proposed to tack on to the Macquarie electorate. Under this scheme, that division would provide a more secure Labour seat than it has done hitherto. But I am not going to remain silent when I consider that a fair adjustment has not been made. than three petitions have been sent in from residents of Bathurst, which is the oldest country town in New South Wales, and the town around which cluster most historic associations, praying that the protribution should be returned to the Commisposed redistribution shall not be adopted. Under the scheme of the Commissioners, Bathurst would be grouped with Lithgow, which is a growing town, and which would doubtless become the centre of the proposed new electorate. That would create considerable ill-feeling, because Bathurst rightly claims to be the natural centre of a certain area. considered the question of community of interest, they would have arranged the boundaries of the Macquarie electorate in such a way that Bathurst would still have been its natural centre. This country owes a good deal to the old historic town of I admit Bathurst, which has given many fine sons to Australia. Some of the oldest families in Australia . hail from that centre..

But I would point out that there are surrounding Bathurst many associations which justify the sentiment existing in the Macquarie electorate, which demands that it should continue to be the centre of that electorate. The proposed redistribution, if adopted, will engender dissension, which is very undesirable. I think, too, that it is high time an adjustment was made as between State electorates and Federal electorates. The same rolls should be used for both State and Federal elections. The boundaries of the State electorates which are contained in any Federal electorate should They are conbe so arranged as to permit of the external State boundaries being coterminus with the boundaries of the Federal electorate.

It is useless to compare a large State like New South Wales, havwith a small State like Tasmania, with an area of about 26,000 square miles. When it is necessary to take, in a whole countryside to obtain the numbers necessary to provide approximately for one man one vote, directions cannot be followed strictly, and there must be diversity of interests represented in a division. The ideal distribution must always be kept in view, and in practice you must get as near as equal value to votes. A margin of variation is provided in order to make redistribution practicable, and to provide for the conservation of interests. The scheme keeps as well within the margin of variation as is possible, and nothing is to be gained by sending it back to the Commissioners.. One electorate cannot be altered without altering several others, perhaps making them worse than they were. Everything that has been said by the honourable members for Nepean, Macquarie, Riverina, and the other critics of the scheme has already been put before the Commissioners, and I do not know how the latter can alter the distribution without beginning at the other end, which would not be of advantage to the country districts. The amendment amounts to a negative of the original motion, and will furnish the Commissioners with no reasons for altering the scheme. They will be forced to read the report of the debates to obtain reasons, and having done so will be more confused than before. land distributions. to send back the scheme, it will be better Act, if that is done, the Minister must send back the scheme for further consideration.

In general, an explanation by a Minister of an ordinary matter submitted is a good thing by way of a lead; but, with a proposal of this kind, nothing is more appropriate than that the Minister should submit it for the consideration of the House, if he is of opinion that the Commissioners have performed their duty to the best of their ability, without conscious bias. For a Minister to take sides in such a matter would certainly be most objectionable. If he . opposed the scheme, or if he approved of it, he would have to give very admirable reasons for doing so. The present Minister of Home Affairs represents a State where there is no redistribution necessary, and, therefore, he cannot, except as a member of the House, be in any way interested in the distribution of New South Wales seats. Under the circumstances, that honourable gentleman is free from any charge regarding partiality. This new-born zeal and virtue cf the honourable member for Parramatta is hardly in keeping with his action as a Minister of the Crown in 1909.

Then, the Queensland redistribution scheme was rejected by one House, and when it came back-although , to my mind, it was in no way improved-the House accepted it.

Whilei t is hardly in keeping with the dignity of Parliament that any one party should claim a special virtue in these matters, the action of the late Government in deserting their colleague who moved the acceptance of a scheme of redistribution was certainly not commendable. If a Ministry believe that a scheme has been drawn up in good faith they should support it. It would be an outrage on the constitutional duty that devolves upon a Ministry in a matter of this kind to make it a party question, and such an action could not be taken with the object of securing the best possible representation of the Commonwealth. The speeches to which we have listened during this debate should convince us that the law which provides that Parliament shall itself decide upon the acceptance or rejection of every scheme of re-arrangement of electorates is unsatisfactory. That has been my opinion, based upon experience, ever since the system has been in force, and I hope that the day is close at hand when we shall have a, strong tribunal to settle matters of this kind, and that the decision of that tribunal will be final. The tribunal might be a little stronger in numbers than is the present one for drawing up redistribution ' schemes. honourable member constitute it? gest that the tribunal should be constituted by law. I should enact that men holding certain offices should constitute the tribunal, to be presided over by, say, a District Court Judge, and that their decision should be final. The procedure which we have adopted, and for which 1 am as much responsible as any one else, was the result of growth. States, the Government of the day distributed the electorates, and submitted their scheme to Parliament. The scheme was then referred to a Select Committee, both -ides were represented, and a conclusion arrived at. That system was found to [181]2 work very well in Western Australia in the early days of self-government, but is unsuitable now. In the first Electoral Act passed by this Parliament one Commissioner was authorized to carry out the work, but that was not found to be satisfactory. It would not be satisfactory to have only one Commissioner to distribute a large area like New South Wales, Queensland, or Victoria into Federal electorates. We now have three Commissioners in each State to do this work for the Commonwealth, and have provided that one of their number shall be the Surveyor-General for the State. It is reasonable to assume that the Surveyor-General must have a considerable knowledge of the several districts and of the general geography of his State. If we had a tribunal, consisting of men holding certain offices, for the time being presided over by a Judge, and declared that the decision of that tribunal should be final, I am sure we should respect its findings, even if we did not always agree with them. We should, at least, know that no political influence had been brought to bear upon it, and that is absolutely essential in the interests of our parliamentary system. The Government seem to take to themselves some credit-and perhaps they are deserving of a little-becaus e they have supported schemes submitted by the Commissioners appointed by them, notwithstanding that their party have been opposed to them. After all, however, they are not deserving of very much praise. The attitude they have taken up would be all very well if it were assumed on only one occasion, but when we see it repeated more than once, it must be admitted that they are acting in a most undignified way. In the first place, a scheme is submitted to the House, and is supported by the Government. The House rejects it, and an amended scheme is submitted, with the result that the Ministry again support it. A. scheme might be sent back half-a-dozens times, and it seems almost ludicrous that every amended scheme should be supported by the Government. It suggests that they have no opinion, and are willing to support anything. the-slot machine. ing like a mere machine.

Everybody knows that. knows that his party would have lost the representation of Fremantle if that distribution had been carried. the re-arrangement of the Fremantle electorate was not considered suitable. But the arrangement of my electorate, the Swan, suited me personally. It made my seat absolutely safe.

To-day Ministers appear to be merely "" rubber stamps."" They will support anything. vote for this arrangement, and if it does not suit their supporters they will vote for the next one that is presented. Upon a former occasion a good deal was said in reference to a discrepancy of 3,000 or 4,000 electors as between one electoral division and another. But under the redistribution which we are now considering there is a discrepancy of 8,726. This shows that the argument then used by the member for Coolgardie had no real foundation. Mr VV. J. JOHNSON -Then why does not the honourable member vote against it? jecting to it. It is sometimes necessary for one electorate to be larger than another, because of community of interest, or for some other good reason, and the law provides for this being done. I agree with the honourable member for Macquarie that we should do our best to make the external boundaries of the State electorates and the Federal electorates the same. We have always managed to do that in Western Australia, although there are only five Commonwealth electoral divisions in that State. Each Federal electorate consists of so many State electorates, and the Commissioners do their best to make the external boundaries the same. That is a great convenience, because the electors know the State electorate boundaries, whereas they do not know the Federal electorate boundaries so well. They are familiar with the external boundaries of the State electorates of Beverley or Albany, for instance, but when we cut across a State electorate it is difficult for them to know whether they are in one Federal electorate or in another. I think, too, we should endeavour to make the Federal and the State rolls the same. expense. be much more convenient. are so many electorates, as in Victoria and New South Wales, it should be an easy matter to group them together. My principal object in rising was to urge upon the Government that the course of action which they are pursuing is neither edifying nor dignified has not suggested any scheme. They will had outlined a plan, but will now do so again. Instead of Parliament being' the final tribunal to determine the boundaries of electoral divisions, the Commissioners in each State should, be the final arbiters. They should be nominated in the Statute, and might well be the officers occupying the following positions in each State :The Surveyor-General, the Chief Electoral Officer for the Commonwealth, the Chief Electoral .Officer for the State, and the Registrar-General, with a District Court",42,Chapman Thi S Thus Showing Community Of Interest The

The Commissioners ""have, therefore, been empowered, in making a redistribution, to exceed or go below the quota., as the case may require, to an -extent of not more than one-fifth. The 'quota for New South Wales has been fixed at 34,657, allowing a maximum of 41,588 -and a minimum of 27,726 for a division, and a difference of nearly 14,000 between 'the maximum and the minimum. -discrepancy has been permitted because it bas been realized that the difficulties under which country electors labour in recording -a vote makes it impossible for the same -number of votes to be recorded in a coun-try division as can be recorded in a city 'division. In view of this fact, it is surprising to hear the statement that the principle of one-man-one-vote and one-voteone-value is a reason for sending back this -distribution to the Commissioners, and asking them to equalize the numerical strength -of the electors. A stronger reason than any other for not insisting upon having divisions with equal numerical strength is -that a large number of the country electorates were recently disfranchised by the abolition of the postal vote. In the city -a man can record his vote on his way to work in the morning, or on returning home ""in the afternoon. leave their work. bering the hours that the polling booths are ""kept open. Very few electors in the city have to spend half-an-hour in recording -their vote, but country electors have often -a long, hard day's ride to get to the polling booth, and it is often impossible for '-many women to record their votes at all. If the divisions were of the same numerical -strength, the principle of one-vote-one-value would not be recognised in the least. To refer to it is the lame excuse of men who are driven into a corner, and who, if -honest, would admit that their objections have no good foundation. We have been told, too, that community of interest should have been more studied, as though all the mining people could be in one division, all the dairying people in another, all the pas'toralists in another, and so on. That, of course, is not possible. In my division, for This Parliament, has apexample, there are a certain number of miners, but they, in the view of some honourable members, are disfranchised because the predominating influence is the dairying interest. In the Nepean division we have Lithgow, with its mines and manufactures; the Blue Mountains, where the industry is fruit-growing; Penrith, on this side of the mountains, where there is agriculture combined with fruit-growing j and, still nearer the coast, the city influence. Again, in Macquarie, at Orange there is the fruit growing interest, at Lucknow the mining interest, at Bathurst the agricultural interest, and, further out, the pastoral interest. This In every constituency there must be diversity of interest, all sorts and conditions of people being within the one Boundary. That cannot be avoided. Nor is it possible in making a redistribution to absolutely maintain the old associations. A redistribution presupposes the alteration of boundaries, and the reallotment of electors. That brings me to another point, the claim that the Commonwealth divisional boundaries should follow as closely as possible the State divisional boundaries. In a general way the State divisions should be recognised, but it is impossible to recognise them in every instance. electorates and 27 Federal electorates in New South Wales, and if the honourable member can divide 90 by 27 and get an absolutely even result, he is a cleverer man than I am. pect anybody to be 1 one of the practical difficulties with which we are immediately faced. altered by arrangement with the State? a redistribution of seats, with an alteration in the number of members, for the State House, every time it was necessary to have a redistribution for the Federal House, and that would be asking something altogether unreasonable from the States. It is utterly impossible to have the numbers exactly in correspondence, and to make the boundaries coincide in every particular; and, in my opinion, any attempt in that direction would lead to still greater discrepancy in community of interest.

If these two divisions were excluded from the comparison, the range of the proposed divisions would be 6,717. Every one must admit that the divisions in the western part of New South Wales call for particular treatment, and that they are very difficult to deal with in any way. I grant willingly that, so far as Deniliquin is concerned, there is no community of interest with the Barrier or Broken Hill, but that can be said equally of the whole of the pastoral country north of that place. What would be the position if we adopted the suggestion of the honourable member for Riverina, and took in a considerable part of the western portion of the Darling electorate? Would there be any greater community of interests ? There are, of course, mining centres in both portions; but means of communication, after all, are the greatest factor in community of interest in a large electorate such as this. At certain portions of the year, the only way in which the people could reach Broken Hill from the district referred to would be by travelling round by Sydney and Melbourne, or about 1,500 miles further than the people of Deniliquin are called upon to travel. the Darling, and get within 70 miles of Broken Hill. himself pointed out that, at certain seasons, it is impossible to get from Deniliquin and Cobar to BrokenH ill ; and, so far as the line from Condobolin is concerned, I am confident that we shall see another redistribution before it is completed. As a matter of fact, the part of the country which the honourable member for Riverina suggests should be included would be in a worse position than that part recommended by the Commissioners, so far as means of communication are concerned; and I have no doubt that that was the reason which weighed with the Commissioners. Taking the whole of the circumstances into consideration, honourable members should vote for the scheme which has been submitted. Personally, I am in the happy position that there is practically no change in my electorate, and in the portion severed from my electorate, the voting is _about equally I draw the attendivided.

That was done by the late Government. ing the enormous discrepancies in New South Wales, we should take no risks, but agree to the scheme as submitted. not so fortunate as the honourable member for Richmond, because my electorate has been interfered with very considerably. If the scheme submitted is adopted, I shall have to say good-bye to two sections, at any rate, of my present constituents, with a large majority of whom I have been on particularly good terms, politically and personally, during the whole of my life. It is suggested that community of interest has not been sufficiently taken into account in the preparation of this scheme, but who can say that in Illawarra at present there is full community of interest? About one-half of the constituency consists of the dairying and agricultural class, and the other half of the mining class; and wherever redistribution may take place discrepancies of the sort must crop up. Considering how population and the industrial and commercial interests of New South Wales are distributed, I do not see how it is possible to carve out constituencies so as to insure absolute community of interest. We all believe that, as far as possible, the vote of every man and woman should be equal; but in New South Wales, if an election were held on the present distribuv tion, we should have a constituency of 22,000 electors with a voting power equal to that of another electorate of 49,000 voters.

No one has suggested that, in preparing this scheme, they have been influenced by any improper consideration, or that they have not acted to the best of their ability. simply say that there has been an error of judgment. been said during this debate which would warrant either myself or any other member voting against the scheme. Let us consider, for a moment, the complaint made by the honourable member for Riverina in regard to portion of his electorate having been added to the constituency of Barrier. He pointed out that in the chief centre of Barrier there were 30,000 miners, and that scattered over a large area comprising portion of the original electorate of Riverina, which had been added to the electorate of Barrier, there were 15,000 agriculturists and pastoralists. That state of affairs is by no means peculiar to the electorate of Barrier. It exists in the electorate of Illaportion of the constituency of Lang, inwarra, for instance, and, in my opinion, it is absolutely impossible to make any distribution of New South Wales without some slight conflict of interest. We know ""that, under the Act, the Commissioners are bound to take into consideration community of interest, as far as it is possible to do so. In view of the great falling off in the number of electors in the southern constituencies, and particularly in the electorate of Eden-Monaro, it seems to me that it was absolutely impossible for the Commissioners to avoid cutting into Illawarra in order to secure for Eden-Monaro the requisite number of electors. They had also necessarily to cut into the electorate of Werriwa to a certain extent. So far as I am aware there has been no public outcry in New South Wales regarding this With the exception of a few redistribution. I have not heard of any large public meeting being held to protest against it. Only one protest came from my own constituency, and that was from Berry, which has hitherto formed part of the southern portion of Illawarra, but has been, added, under this scheme, to the electorate of Eden-Monaro. That protest was forwarded to me by the mayor of the town, and was carried at a public meeting. commercial interests of Berry, Nowra, and other towns in that district tend towards Sydney rather than towards Eden Monaro, I am bound to admit that the residents of Nowra, Berry, CambewaTra, and other towns in that part of New South Wales have more community of interest, so far as their individual occupations are concerned, with the residents of Eden Monaro than they have with those who rehear ! We side in the big industrial districts in the northern part of the electorate of Illawarra. Whilst the people of those districts have been separated from the farming communities of Dapto, Jamberoo, Kiama, and Gerringong, they are certainly at one, so far as community of interests is concerned, with the people of Bega, Pambula, and other portions of Eden Monaro. If this redistribution is carried the farming section of the community in Kiama, Jamberoo, Gerringong, and Dapto will have very little hope of having their interests properly represented in competition with the large industrial vote which exists in the northern end of the Illawarra electorate, and which will be increased to a very large extent by the extension of the Illawarra constituency so as to embrace cluding such industrial centres as Mortlake. It was urged by the honourable member for Werriwa that community of interest has not been considered in determining the boundaries of his electorate, and",47,Chapman Thi S Thus Showing Community Of Interest The

374,Mr Fuller,"As to that, nothing hasin support of his contention he mentioned that portion of the electorate of Illawarra had been added to his constituency. Those who are familiar with the country, however, will recognise that the districts which have been transferred from Illawarra to Werriwa-suc h as Moss Vale, Camden, Picton, and Bowral-hav e more community of interest with Werriwa than with Illawarra. Goulburn. point out that on sale days at Moss Vale, it is usual to find from 50 to 100 residents of Goulburn doing business there. Likewise, people from Moss Vale, Camden, Picton, and Bowral will be found in the Goulburn saleyards from time to time, and it cannot be denied that, so far as business and social relation are concerned, there is community of interest between the people of these districts and the rest of Werriwa. The honourable member has also objected that the existing railway communication with these districts has not been taken into consideration. I fail to understand how' he could advance such an argument. We all know that the Great Southern line runs through Camden, up to Picton, Moss Vale, Bowral, and other centres of population which have been added to Werriwa, and enables residents there to communicate with Goulburn, fhe big centre of the constituency. That being so, the honourable member's contention falls to the ground.

Mr W. J.

In all the circum-. stances, however, I believe the redistribution has been made with due regard to the change in population, and that it more fully meets the interests of the people than does the existing distribution. I do not know what position Ministers are going to take up, but I trust that, before the next general election, the remarkable discrepancy existing between the number of electors in various electorates throughout New South Wales will be remedied, and that we shall errdeavour, as far as possible, to see that theprinciple of one man one vote, and one voteone value, can be fully recognised in connection with the next Federal election.

It is absurd to compel our officers to attend the sittings of Parliament from half-past 10 in the morning until n o'clock at night, and not pay them more than when Parliament meets at half-past 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

Some steps were taken to obtain paper of a better We should set an quality, but, as events turned out, it was fortunate that a full supply was not ordered until it was ascertained how it would be received. Instructions were given that a certain quantity of the old paper and certain quantities of better quality paper should be placed in the various rooms, in order to ascertain how it was received. One result was that honourable members complained that the ink would not run on the good paper, and, further, that the envelopes of the better class paper would not stick. The good paper is largely left, and the inferior paper used; but it is proposed to continue the practice of supplying both kinds until a decided preference is shown. The price of envelopes has risen, I may say, from 9s. 6d. per 1,000 to 28s.

As to the note-paper controversy, I think that the paper provided for our use is not as good as it might be. It is certainly not as good as can be obtained in any stationer's shop. The envelopes are the worse that I have ever been asked to use. They are absolutely without gum, and one spends as much time in gumming down an envelope as one should have to spend in gumming down a dozen. It would be well to sell the envelopes that we have in stock. Students of heraldry might be glad to buy them for the sake of the coat-of-arms i m printed on them. They might regard them as interesting souvenirs; but the envelopes are no good for practical purposes. We should endeavour to have some made by a manufacturer who realizes that gum is, after all, an important part of the building of an envelope. able member for Capricornia, who has been in the journalistic profession, and consequently realizes the value of a paper that can be easily torn up, to give us the benefit of his judgment upon this question.

In this matter, I think that we have the case of a bad workman complaining of his tools. The note-paper is as good as any man could wish to use if he is able to write a decent hand. Many honourable members who write a hand that it is almost impossible to read wish to blame the paper for their own shortcomings. Some complain that the paper used in making the envelopes is too thin, and that their writing is visible through the envelopes. As to the coat-of-arms, I see nothing very wrong with it. It is certainly Australian in character. The kangaroo's tail is, perhaps, a little short, but I do not know that any other fault can be found with the device. The note-paper is so tough that one could almost make a shroud out of it. I think that a lot of time has been wasted in discussing this matter.

A little while ago complaints were made regarding the quality of the note-paper supplied to honourable members, and we were assured that afterwards a better quality was supplied. I did not appreciate the improvement, but a number of my friends who have finer tastes told me that the stationery which was supplied after those complaints were made was very much better than it had been. superior paper, and enclosed them in superior envelopes, and then found that I could read all that I had written through the envelopes. I certainly did complain of that to Mr Speaker. We ought"" at least to be furnished with envelopes which will render the writing in our letters invisible. Some of the note-paper in our Parliamentary Library is as thick as an ordinary pen, and it will almost break before it can be folded up. that good paper. Lately a Committee was appointed in the House of Commons, at cellor of the Exchequer, to investigate the Estimates. That gentleman frankly told the House that he could not follow the authorities of Parliament to expend money, and see that its intention was carried out. He, therefore, asked that a Committee should be appointed to deal with the Estimates, and that course was adopted. A Committee of Accounts has also been' appointed for the purpose of investigating account matters. Strange to say, one of their first reports, which was made a month or two ago, has reference to the supply of note-paper to the House of Commons. Mr Speaker talks of the expenditure of t ^ i o o here as if it would bankrupt the Commonwealth. But the report in question shows that for note-paper and stationery, the expenditure of the House of Commons alone, amounts to ,£9,000 a year. They have discovered that, because each Minister selects his own brand of note-paper, the cost of supplying this article mittee has pointed out that there are is increased by ,£2,000 a year. rently, the Imperial Ministers have expensive tastes in note-paper. The Committee recommend that the same kind of note-paper should be used by every one. These small expenses, in the aggregate, amount to a great deal, and we might, in all seriousness, follow the example of the House of People Commons. I find that there are sixty-sis items in these Estimates relating to incidental and petty cash expenditure, the sums so appropriated ranging from ,£2 to ,£5,000, and totalling ,£45,000. No one knows how this money is spent. Then, there is an enormous expenditure under the heading of "" Contingents,"" and,, again, the entry "" Miscellaneous"" shows its head everywhere throughout the Estimates. Under these three headings the expenditure must be very large indeed. OneI wrote my letters on a would think that two or three petty cash accounts would be enough for any Departmentj but some of them have ten or a dozen. This is a convenient way of pro; viding for the spending of money without the knowledge of Parliament. business must keep petty cash accounts,, and every Department. counts must depend on the size and nature of the business. ment, we badly need a Committee to investigate the spending of the Departments. The House of Commons has found it of advantage to have an investigation into its expenditure, and we might well follow itsexample. The sooner we get a Committee of Accounts the better. mittees in the State Parliaments. do useful work. Such a Committee is more necessary here, because we have no Public Works Committee, and everything is left to Ministers. It is no reflection on Ministers to say that they cannot investigate in detail the expenditure of their Departments, and Parliament has no check. Having voted the money, we do not know how it is spent, so far as small details are concerned; and in big businesses, details often make the difference between profit and loss. The sooner we make a change the better. The honourable member for Wentworth the other night spoke of the Committees connected with the French' Parliament.

A great deal has been said about the quality of our note-paper, and the discussion reminded me of the report of the House of Commons to which I have referred. It is estimated that a saving of some thousands of pounds will be the result of the investigations of the House of Commons Committee, and a Committee to investigate our expenditure would also do valuable work. more needed because we have no check upon our expenditure. Such a Committee could obtain information regarding the way in which money is expended on telephone tunnels, the purchase of steel rails, and other matters about which we can get no information, and in regard to which our inquiries are regarded as a deep and dark political conspiracy. Mr .FISHER I shall try to get the honowing to the fact that two have resigned orable-member any information that he desires if he will tell me what it is. I look into as many of these matters as I can. the right honourable member does that. My remarks are quite impersonal. Committees of the kind to which I refer have been established in every country in which government has become complex. Ministers cannot poke their noses into questions of detail, and are not paid to do so. Their business is to direct the general policy of the Departments. member is now speaking at large. Some years ago I had the privilege of inventing a security envelope, for which I got a lot of kudos and praise, though not much cash. My investigations showed me that it is very easy to open ordinary envelopes, especially when made of stiff paper, to which the gum does not adhere very well. It is not so easy to open envelopes made of paper of poor quality. In the case of the thick, expensive paper, the gum does not act so well as in the case of the ordinary paper, which is good enough for anybody to use. I cannot see where the advantage is in having every single sheet of note-paper embossed. Of course, in the case of collectors, such specimens of parliamentary paper might be of some value, but, as one who, I suppose, has the largest correspondence of any private memberI have over 7,000 letters filed since last electionI do not think that the majority of those who receive letters addressed from this House take any notice of the coat-of-arms. We may take it, I think, that the embossing costs about twice as much as the printing of a similar design. There is no doubt that the coat-ofarms might be more artistically designed. Under all the circumstances, I regard the cheapest stationery as much more common sense and business like. Proposed vote agreed to.

It is to be regretted,though I do not think this is the fault of the Library Committee-that this collection should be hidden away in the way it is. WheneverI have visitors to Parliament House, this collection is one of the first things I show them. The early historical records are the most profoundly interesting of anything connected with our Parliament; and I am afraid that they may be spoiled if they are constantly handled. Under the circumstances, some provision ought to be made for their protection under glass. There are documents in the collection which, if I had them in my personal possession, would be protected in a very different way. There are a number of prints, coloured and uncoloured, which were issued when New South Wales was the entire colony on the eastern coast, and which are of unique interest.

I should like to draw particular attention to the pamphlet records.

I am referring more particularly to the pamphlets dealing with New Zealand, the Islands, and so forth; and I fancv they could easily be bound, separately if that be desired. Otherwise, I am afraid, these documents will simply fall to pieces in time reprint the rare pamphlets and safeguard the originals. this opportunity to bring the question under the notice of Parliament. This collection is invaluable, and its interest ought to be realized more than it is at present. I hope that the advice of the honourable member for Wentworth will not be followed. If we consulted the Archivist himself, or any experienced collector, we their great value because qf their age and scarcity, and because they are in their original form. We all know the extent to which bibliomania is carried. Original books sometimes attain greater value because they have never been cut; and I have known many cases in which engravings, worth hundreds of pounds, have completely lost their value because the edges have been cut for the purpose of framing. I readily admit that this mania may be carried too far for practical people, but, at the same time, the pamphlets are the contents of our archives, and they derive their value from their original form, and we ought to hesitate before we disfigure them' in any way, even by binding them. There is another matter to which I desire to call attention. The Prime Minister, I know, sympathizes with the attempt which the Archivist has been making during the whole of his life to prepare a bibliographical index to Australian literature. Mr Petherick has spent a very long period in indexing the literature which> has a bearing on Australia in all stages of its history. have seen it, and I know of what enormous value such a work will be to the world. Every library would possess itself of a copy if it were printed. Mr Petherick has made his work the idol of his life, and we know from personal conversations These pamphlets, of course, with him that he could in a very shorttime have the first part ready for publication, and could afterwards proceed to' keep the record up to date.

He may speak privately to many people, but I distinguish between that and a desire for publicity. Petherick should be encouraged in every -way to bring his work before the public. He is a man of years, and we may lose him at any moment; and, in my opinion, there is not another man in Australia who could more ably complete this work for printing. We ought, therefore, to avail ourselves of his presence here; and, in my opinion, this would prove one of the most valuable publications that has ever gone out of Australia. The value of a particular branch of the Library to which the honourable member for Wentworth has referred cannot be overstated, but we ought to remember that the present habitation is only a temporary one. In a few years we shall have our own establishment, and then, as in the case of the Mitchell Library, accommodation can be provided worthy of the collection. I ask honourable members to remember that "" Mr Petherick is getting into years, and, while he is in health, he ought to be encouraged to issue this publication for the benefit of the world and rick ought to be enabled to continue from day to day, so that, by-and-by, we may have the credit and glory of producing, through him, the finest bibliographical .index to the history of the Australian continent. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. The subject of our Library has been raised by several honourable members, and special reference has been made to the Petherick Collection. The Commonwealth is to be congratulated upon the possession of such a magnificent collection as that made by Mr Petherick, to whom we are deeply indebted for his gift to the nation. If Mr it would be wise to bind all our Petherick had not been, not only a booklover, but a man of considerable discretion and ability, his wonderful collection would never have been obtained. There was a danger of it being dissipated and scattered over the libraries of the world; but, fortunately, Mr Petherick, with great public spirit, entered into a contract with us to take his collection as a gift to the nation, and in return for his action we appointed him Commonwealth Archivist. The Parliament accepted the-gift in the spirit in which it was offered. We ought to try to preserve this magnificent collection in our Library in the Federal Capital, and to supplement and build it up in every possible way, so that we may have in the Mr Capital of the Commonwealth the best historical material that can be gathered for the use of those who in the future will be called upon to write the story of early Australia. This collection is important, not only from a literary, but from a geographical and scientific point of view. Honourable members would do well to let it be known outside that Mr Speaker will be pleased to accept from the public generally books, documents, or written records of value as going to make up the history of Australia. A great deal of our early history is probablv to be found in written letters forming part of private correspondence in the early days. If many of those documents which are now only in manuscript could be 'collected and presented to Mr Speaker as a. gift to the nation, valuable additions would be made to the wealth of historical matter which we now possess. As Chairman of the Library Committee Mr Speaker thoroughly realizes his responsibility in respect of the works now in our possession. I speak from my knowledge of his action as Chairman of the Library Committee, and am able to say that he has taken all possible steps to properly safeguard the collection. He has readily acceded to any requests made by Mr Petherick for additional glass casing or improved cupboards or drawers for the storing of his collection, and in so doing I am sure has only carried out rick lets it be known that any volumes in his collection require to be bound, in order to insure their preservation, the Committee will be pleased to take whatever steps are necessary to preserve them intact. At the same time it is open to question, as suggested by an honourable member, whether pamphlets together in book form. Before they are bound they should at least be classified: but whilst we are still engaged in the process of collecting, it would be a mistake to bind them. That should not be done until the collection is complete. Until we reach the Federal Capital this Library must remain in a more or lessfloating condition. We cannot attempt to treat it as if finality had been reached. I hope that it is only the germ of thefuture library of Australia. I sincerely",59,Estimates

We young Australians do not know yet the pioneering work that was done in this continent, not merely in opening up the country, but in developing the political liberties which we now enjoy. The Library which we are now collecting will be invaluable as a source of enlightenment in this respect. There is ample scope for men of literary gifts for original research in Australia. A tribute in this reThe spect should be paid to one of our own Hansard staff for his excellent work. I do not suggest, however, that it will supersede the Mitchell Library, which is undoubtedly ' the premier collection in Australia and which, I hope, will continue to expand. Those who have been privileged to go through that Library must have recognised the wonderful work done by Mr Mitchell, but, whilst it continues to grow, we shall not be We have made an excellent absolved from the duty of seeing that our own Library is developed. We are fortunate in the fact that Mr Speaker has ably followed up the splendid energy displayed by the late Mr Speaker Holder in The work of going this regard. He has been unremitting in his zeal to safeguard the Library, and to do everything possible to make it an efficient instrument for the assistance of those who are working here in the interests of the nation. It is not often* that we have an opportunity to express our gratitude to him, and I , as a member of the Library Committee, may, perhaps, be pardoned for paying this tribute of praise to the work that he is doing in this respect. -The remarks made by the honourable For member for Darling Downs are well worthy of consideration.

We have in our Library a book in which honourable members are invited to make suggestions as to works which should be added to the collection. In this book I have made only two suggestions. One was that a copy of Black America, which was written by a special correspondent of the Times, who was sent over to deal with the negro question in the United States of America, and which would be of great interest to supporters of the White Australia policy, should be purchased. Any Australian who reads Black America will recognise that it would be a calamity for Australia to run the risk of having in this continent the state of affairs that has arisen in America from the introduction of negroes. I suggested some years ago that a copy of that work should be obtained, but it has not yet been purchased. I also suggested that a book dealing with the rise and fall of the Confederacy of the American States, which gives a very valuable insight into a matter of great importance to Australia-the relative powers of the States and the Federation-shoul d be placed on the Library shelves.

There are certain standard works that should be in the Library, but are not to be found there. I do not wish to find fault with the Library Committee, but I think an effort should be made to secure books dealing with matters which the people and the legislators of Australia have to consider in their every-day political lives. I would suggest that the Library Committee should allow their attention to cover a much wider scope than it has hitherto done. We are accumulating a very valuable Library, but a great deal more might be accomplished in the direction of securing works of reference, which would not becostly and which would be almost invaluable to us. desire to refer to a new feature connected* with our Parliamentary Library. I alludeto the art collection which, of late, has been growing rapidly. For instance, there are the excellent reproductions of -some of the old masters by Mr Mortimer Menpes, which are now, quite inappropriately, interfering with the chaste beauty of the Queen's Hall. Those reproductions would be perfectly beautiful if properly housed; but, at present, they seem tcdetract from the white simplicity of the very fine hall which is to be found in thecentre of this building. Such important details as the light which is required to> set off a picture, have, owing to theexigencies of the situation, been entirely-overlooked. Those are considerations which are worthy of the attention of the LibraryCommittee. A good many complimentary things 1 have been said in regard to the Petherick Collection, but not one word which istoo complimentary. Personally, I doubt whether our treatment of the aged' Archivist is sufficiently considerate. ' That, old man, to whose life-long devotion weowe this great collection, spends his days ir* a gloomy vault, without an assistant.

If the Library Committee are up to their work, three years hence, when we ought to be in Yass-Canberra, we shall have acquired a Library the looking after of which will require the services of, at least, one clerk and three assistant clerks. I do not think that the system of engaging temporary clerks and messengers is a good one to adopt in connection with any Library. These men ought to be made permanent. I notice, too, that a cataloguer is employed. He is the only man who is receiving any increase outside of the temporary messengers. The whole matter requires looking into, from the housing of the Library down to the employment of temporary clerks in the Library. Reference has been made to the Mitchell Library, and to the greatness of that collection. It is a collection the comprehensiveness of which -I hope will be equalled by our own collection in the course of a year or two; but we cannot, at present, hope to give our Library that recognition which New South Wales has bestowed upon her Library. That State has erected a great public building in which to house her Library, and we cannot do that because we are merely in temporary possession of this building. At the same time, we ought to do something to allow the public to appreciate, the importance of the Mitchell Collection. The Library Committee have been paying more attention to subscriptions to newspapers, periodicals and annuals than they have been to the purchase of books, maps, plates, periodicals, documents, &c. This year it is proposed to expend ,£320 in subscriptions to newspapers, periodicals and annuals, as against .£200 which was appropriated for the purpose last year-an increase of ,£120-whereas, of the sum of ,£1,800 voted last year for the purchase of new books, maps, plates and documents, o n I v £59& wa s upon the collection of Australian historical records, the expenditure of ,£650 was authorized last year, of which sum only ,£150 was spent.

I draw attention to these matters, and hope that no effort will be spared to add to the Commonwealth Collection; otherwise, we shall find, when we leave this building, that, outside of the Petherick I do not hold Collection, we shall have, practically, no ordinary Library of our own. That collection is purely an Australian collection of records. I recognise that one of its most interesting features is the collection relating to the South Sea Islands, which is probably more complete than is any similar collection in the world.

No doubt it is important that the Commonwealth should collect original and reliable data for the history of Australia. It can do that better than any private person. I hope that at the end of the year we shall have something tangible to show for this expenditure. WhatI wish to know is whether any special purchase is now in view. Last year only ^150 was spent. this year. The collection of Australian historical records is one of the biggest works yet undertaken in this country. Some years ago the New South Wales Government published eight volumes, containing official reing to the first period were in the possescords dealing with the early history of New South Wales, which covered the early history of Australia and embraced the period from the foundation of the colony to 1811. A large amount of data, covering the period from 1811 to 1830, was also collected in England and throughout Australia, but was uncollated and unindexed, and the Commonwealth Government undertook the work of putting it into order. the collating, indexing, and sorting of this material has been in progress under the direction of Mr Bladon, who edited some of the volumes to which I have referred. He was to have carried the publication on to the year 1830, under Commonwealth supervision, but unfortunately fell ill, and for twelve or eighteen months before his death the work remained in abeyance. Since then we have been fortunate in securmember asks for a novel that has been sent ing the services of Dr. Watson, who has undertaken the task of editing the unpublished records, and intends to prepare three or four volumes a year. In all, some twenty-five or thirty volumes will be issued, over a period of several years. tention is that the Commonwealth shall carry out the collection and publishing of records down to 1856, when responsible government was established, and that the Governments of each State will be asked to compile their own archives from that date onwards, the Commonwealth Government doing the same work in regard to the Commonwealth archives. When this work has been finished. Australia will have its history complete from the beginning, and will be the only nation in the world in that position. volumes which have been published will be I rise to ask for information rea volume of documents which have since come to light, and belong to the period they cover. That volume will soon be published, and by January or February next we hope to have the first volume of the second series in the hands of the printer. The printing is being done by the Government Printer of New South Wales, and Dr. Watson is now engaged on the big task of going through the records that have been collected. When I mention that there were 150 three-bushel bags of records in one office, and that each paper has to be studied separately, honourable members will realize how enormous the task is. A report received from Dr. Watson a week or ten days ago contained the very agreeable news that, although it had been thought that only eleven original documents relatsion of the New South Wales Government, he has discovered about 160. I have not the slightest doubt that this work when completed will be one pf the greatest historical importance. It is necessary that the work 'should be pushed on, because, notwithstanding every precaution, the records may be destroyed by fire or other agency, and could not be replaced.; Regarding the supply of fiction to the For the past ten or eleven years Library, there is always a difference of opinion as to what books should be taken.

Mr Speaker, of course, is the President, and I would not say that that honourable gentleman would prove the best judge of a racy novel. To help him, Mr Speaker has the honourable member for Calare, who, I understand, is much too busy about other matters to bother about novels. to ask the honourable member how many times he has gone down and viewed the collection of Messers.

No' doubt members of the Library Committee know where they can get good fiction, but, apparently, they think that the refuse of a great circulating library is all that is necessary for honourable members who cannot appreciate the light reading afforded by Hansard. The honourable member for Calare is the right man to help us in choosing a bright breezy novelette, if he would only take the trouble to do so. Other members of the (Library Committee are the honourable member for Darling Downs, the honourable member for Melbourne, the honourable member for Laanecoorie, the honourable member for Bourke, and the honourable member for Darling.

I rose, however, to direct special attention to an item which I find cropping up all through the Estimates, and to make a protest against it item is "" Writing paper and envelopes, including cost of printing and embossing thereon."" Small though the Estimates relating to the Parliament are, this item occurs no less than three or four times. Every little subdivision of a Department selects its own paper, and has its own special inscription placed on it. The practice is ridiculous, as well as inordinately expensive. We find the item under the heading of "" Contingencies"" in connection with the House of Representatives, and also in connection with the Senate. Then we find it under the headings of "" Parliamentary Reporting Staff"" and "" Library."" It is expensive for every one of these little Departments to have its own special brand of paper and envelopes, and special printing That was suggested on a previous thereon. The sooner something is done to stop this waste of money the better for the country. It is even more important than is the question of the literature supplied to honourable members to read in the trains. There are in these Estimates no less than sixty-six distinct items under the headings of "" Incidental and petty cash."" I do not know how many times this item of "" Writing paper and envelopes, including printing and embossing thereon,"" occurs in the Estimates as a whole the incidental expenditure ? penditure of £^45,000 in respect of petty cash, the items ranging from ,£2 to ,£5,000. I should describe an item of ,£5,000 as substantial rather than petty. The expenditure is so broken up that one cannot tell It is the first time that I have heard what any particular item costs in connection with the running of our Departments. It is time that the whole of the Estimates were analyzed, systematized, and presented to Parliament in a different way. The present system seems to be a very convenient way of covering up expenditure, so that the country shall not know what it costs to conduct the Departments along these lines of incidental expenditure. We have only a few officers in this Parliament, but they are scattered over many Departments, and every Department seems to think it necessary to have its own writing paper and envelopes, with special embossing and printing thereon. The whole thing would be a screaming farce if it were not dipping so deeply into the people's pockets. I fail to see why, in connection with our own establishment, at least, we should not have uniform paper and envelopes, and uniform printing thereon. There is no need for The every little sub-branch of a Department to have its own peculiar idiosyncrasies in this way.

It appears to me that the arrangement made for the supply of books in Sydney is infinitely better than that which obtains here. an honourable member is allowed to select his own books from a circulating library. I have no time whilst I am in Melbourne to read books other than those necessary to enable me to properly discharge my legislative duties. But when travelling by train long distances' between the various capitals, we ought to have something to read, and the books supplied to us should be the very best. I would suggest to the Library Committee that they should adopt the same practice in Melbourne as is adopted in Sydney. of the expense.

I hope that that information will be forthcoming ; otherwise some of us may be induced to vote for a reduction of the item which is under consideration. cussion began in an almost farcical spirit, but it seems now to have become serious. In my opinion, the person who is not satisfied with the supply of novels placed at our disposal in the Library is hard to please. Although not a novel reader, I know enough of the world of fiction to be aware "" that there are to be found on the Library table the chief works of the best-known novelists; men like Locke, de Morgan. Max Pemberton, and others. I was nob aware until this evening of the arrangements made by the Library Committee for the supply of fiction, but in Sydney Messrs. Angus and Robertson, as a matter of courtesy, make the membeis of this Parliament honorary subscribers to their library, a privilege of which I have taken advantage largely. From that library, not merely novels, but also any other books, may be taken. A similar arrangement might well be made with some Melbourne library, the privilege, if not granted as a matter of courtesy, being paid for. Should there be any need to alter the arrangements, I hope that an attempt will be made to give effect to the Sydney system.

In economics it is almost an axiom that it is so, and it is certainly so in art. Perhaps not one artiit in a hundred is considered to be a truly great painter until half a century or more after his death. It may be so with politicians. It may be that politicians who are thought the least of at the present time may be regarded later on as among the best of their day. As the honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Gwydir have suggested, those who are considered to be leading men to-day may be thought, some years hence, to have ranked very low, while others may come to be regarded as men who did, great work for their country. It is, therefore, desirable to make the collection as wide as possible in the interests of those who will have to judge in the future.

Other items show looking through the Estimates of the Prime Minister's Department, I am rather struck with the progress in the matter of expenditure made by the Public Service Commissioner's Branch. I was indulging myu l r e "" self in the hope that when the great bulk of the members of the Public Servicenamely, the General Division-were permitted to appeal to the Arbitration Court for the adjustment of their grievances ancl the consideration of their demands, we should see a material reduction in the Estimates pertaining to the Commissioner's office. There ought now to be no great expenditure. All that is required is a staff of officers to keep a record in order to comply with the law which this Parliament has passed. There certainly is no justification for increasing the staff, and there is less justification for increasing the expenditure. If the Arbitration Court is to adjudicate in matters pertaining to the General Division, and is to fix for a period of years the maximum ancl the minimum salaries that should be paid to officers', there should be no necessity for this great Department, which at one time had f u l l control and power-without , I admit, responsibility, which was one of the weaknesses of the whole system. The Public Service Commissioner at one time had f u l l power to assess the value of every officer from a Deputy Postmaster-General down to a messenger boy. But with the .introduction of the new method there ought to be a tendency to economize in our Public Service administration. Because, after all, it must be remembered, our expenditure in other directions will increase. The work of the Arbitration Court in relation to public servants will not be done for nothing. It will cost money to represent the various cases that may be brought before the Court. That is an expenditure which should be set off against that formerly incurred in administering the Public Service Commissioner's office. But I find that there is no curtailment whatever.
