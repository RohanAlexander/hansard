The Mimster Representing The Minister For Defence If I T Is A Fact That The House At Large, The Translation Is The Services Of Chaplains Are Accepted In An Honorary Capacity For Transport Work Between The Commonwealth And Eng","land? Is there any restriction as to the age of clerical gentlemen who offer their services in this capacity? chaplains have been appointed under such conditions within the last twelve months who are over fifty years of age? the information asked for. ' from.the honourable member for Brisbane a letter informing me that he wishes to move the adjournment of the House tocall attention to a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely: "" The circulation of political leaflets printed in the German language."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. -The matter to which I wish to refer was first raised in this House by the honourable member for Wentworth on Wednesday last, and as I had not the opportunity yesterday to complete the remarks which I wished to offer regarding it, I have moved the adjournment now. member must not refer to a previous debate. the newspapers admit this morning that the circular to which attention was drawn, by the honourable member for Wentworth was absolutely innocent. The House must be satisfied that the honourable member bit off more than he could chew. When he rises in this chamber, one is always in doubt as to whether he intends to be cynical, satirical, or funny at the expense of hiB fellow members. However, I intend to take him seriously in this instance. The Prime Minister was very modest yesterday. Perhaps he did not 99 September, 1916. care to read the translation of the circular to which his attention had. been drawn on the previous day, because it contained a eulogy of the Administration of which he was a prominent member. He was, therefore, content to move that the document containing it be printed. Fortunately for myself and fer available. I wish now to let honourable members and the country know which ia the political party that is associated with the Germans in thiB country. The honourable member for Wentworth tried to How many make it appear that I have been seeking German support during the war, and I therefore call attention to advertisements which were published in Brisbane, in a German newspaper, in May, 1915, some eighteen months after the war broke out.",4,Setup

7,Mr Finlayson,"I . am glad thatThe State elections were then proceeding, and I have here a photographic reproduction of German advertisements, giving reasons why German citizens should vote for HerrW . H . Barnes, in stead of for the Labour candidate, MrM c M in n ; for Mr Denham, the Liberal candidate, instead of for Mr Jones, the Labour candidate; for Mr Tolmie, the Liberal candidate, instead of for MrA l k e ; and for Mr Kessell, the Liberal candidate, instead of for Mr Carter. In a later issue they were asked to vote for Mr Walsh, a Liberal candidate, as against Mr Bertram, a Labour candidate. This was at the time when we had reason to fear the results of the fighting. I propose now to read extracts from a leading article which appeared in the newspaper in which these advertisements were published. This is the English translation of the original GermanHave not we Germans sufficient reason to be thankful to the Liberal Government for the friendship and respect which they conferred upon us, and still grant us-especiall y just now. On 22nd May is the opportunity to snow Herr Denham and the Liberal party in general that we are thankful, by voting for the endorsed Liberal candidates. . . . You can easily see from Herr Denham's speech what might happen if the Liberal Government were defeated, and men like Herr Denham, Herr Barnes, &c, who are a great pillar (prop, stay, or support) for you and Germans in general, had to give up the Treasury benches. . . . When one can do no more (work) in his own home if he so desires ancl, moreover, children and dependants are set (the verb really means ""stirred up,"" or ""incited to rebellion""), against their parents, it is just about time to put an end to this political activity by merely putting a cross opposite the names of the ""Liberal"" candidates in the different districts on polling day. . . . On Saturday morning last the first news was received in Brisbane of the sinking of the great bane. I have here a digest of the news that English ship, thc Lusitania. The Cunard liner left New York last week with 1,300 passengers for England. The first news announced that the ship had been sunk by a German submarine. . . . We have before us a pamphlet which bears the signatures of the deputy-leader, and secreThe reference is not to the present tary of the Labour party, E. G. Theodore and J. Fihelly. "" Tampering with the Franchise "" is the heading, and on the other side there is a cartoon of the German Crown Prince and Herr Denham. The Crown Prince has a large sack in his hand with the inscription, "" Booty stolen in Belgium,"" while Herr Denham holds a similar one with the inscription "" Votes stolen from the workers."" If anything should cause a right-thinking voter, and especially us Germans, not to give our votes this time to the Labour party, it is this insulting (offensive, scurrilous, or disagreeable) picture! Those signatories expect the Germans to vote for them. This appeal for German support during the war received, as one may imagine, considerable notice in other newspapers published in Brisbane, but it did not prevent the appearance of further advertisements in German. I have more advertisements by Liberal candidates appealing, in the German language, for the support of German electors. not being made now. which the honourable member for Wentworth drew attention had no reference to preasnt political circumstances. Not a single Labour man has appealed to the Germans for support during the war; such appeals have come only from Liberals. During the Queensland State elections, in May 1915, the Liberal Government published in Germani n the News Budget, a German edition of the weekly Courier, and in the German newspaper, their manifesto for the election. The honourable member for Wide Bay was a member of the party at the time, and, therefore, identified with that publication. Not only that, .but the leading Liberal organ in Queensland, until March last, published weekly a News Budget containing three pages in the German language, giving all the news of the war and other information. I propose to tell honourable members the kind of news that was thus being published weekly for the in formation of German readers. An advertisement appeared each week inviting contributions, and asking that they be addressed to the Germaff editor of the News Budget, Courier Buildings, Brisappeared on 22nd January, 1916. There were several poems, in one of which was an appreciative reference to the ""Kaiser's little daughter."" The word "" Kaiserlich "" occurs often in this poem. Kaiser, but to some past monarch; but, nevertheless, the appeal to German national sentiment-no t Australian or British sentiment is unmistakable. There is an account of a German wedding, at which a "" real German wedding breakfast"" was given, and the usual toasts were honoured. Then there is an interesting reference to the confirmation",4,Adjournment Formal Appeals To Germans

Every honourable member knows tliat the action which was threatened would cover, not only the honourable member who did it , but also this Parliament, with dishonour that would live through the ages. That men in this House should be so blind to the duty they owe in this war to our own people and to our people over the seas, as to deliberately aim at causing trouble that would help no one but the Germans is beyond comprehension, and when I see men prepared to sink to that depth, I want to know the explanation and interpretation of everything in the German tongue that I see over their signatures. These things, I ask honourable members to recollect, are not published in the newspapers as are the articles from which the honourable member for Brisbane has quoted to-day, they are not mere public advertisements that any man may see: they are things which are circulated secretly.

It was quite understood that the appeal had been issued during the war, and one cannot but believe that that is the meaning the honourable member in tended to convey. Matters are serious enough without this sort of thing occurring, and if honourable members resort to such methods, it is time the House took a hand. is necessary, in the interests of a man who is absent, to deny certain statements that have been made. I refer to the reverend pastor mentioned by the honourable member for Brisbane, and I have to say that, owing to the fact that a large portion of his congregation were Labour, while some of them were Liberal, in politics. gentleman went around canv .ssirig and advocating my return is absolutely without any foundation. It ought to be pointed out that for many years past, and, indeed, until the lady died recently, the Labour party in Maryborough employed a Miss Gehrman as their organizer, and another, a Mr Gehrman, in tbe sane capacity. the secretary of the Labour organization was a Mr Schiber, another German. It has been said that I was returned on the German vote, but if Germans did vote for me, it only shows their common sense in giving me the support they gave to Mr Eisher. I challenge any honourable member to say that, either on the public platform or by circular, I asked Germans to give me their vote. Such a denial is only just to me as a true and loyal Britisher, who not only has done all he can himself to help the Empire, but has sons, one who fought in Gallipoli and two are now fighting in Prance. I have the right to stand up and say that these gross, mean, contemptible insinuations are not worthy of the honourable member for Brisbane. A t the last election for Wide BayI heard from scores of people that the honourable member for Brisbane stood un in fron t of the Royal hotel, Maryborough, arid, before a large audience, declared that this is a capitalists' war. What was the object of that but to keep people fro m enlisting-to keep people from fighting for the Empire to preserve the liberties ithat .Labour .adherents, as well as others, enjoy? Men like that are the very last who ought to criticise others who haye undoubtedly shown their loyalty. I have shown mine in a way that the honourable member does not seem to be able to. Has he sent his sons to the warthose big .strapping fellows? No. He has not helped in the slightest degree. body can take any credit for proceedings of this sort, and, had the honourable member for Brisbane introduced the subject himself, I should certainly not have been one to support him. That honourable member, however, is quite entitled to act as he has done under the circumstances. If there are honourable members who can give any credit to the honourable member for Wentworth for what he has done, let he never took . any part them give him credit. I do not think The assertion that that that even honourable members opposite feel that that honourable member has played the game fairly. It is well known that, prior to the war, the Germans here were recognised as good citizens, ' and, underthe circumstances, the honourable member for Brisbane was quite right in showing that other men have, since the war, done what he did before the war. attacking others unfairly . ter at that. Every one knows distinctly and clearly what is the object underlying the action of the honourable member for Wentworth-a n action in pursuance of a policy not confined to himself, but shared by others. I direct your attention to the fact that on this side there are men just as honourable as men on the other side, and that some of us hold certain opinions which the Prime Minister held only a few months ago. It is useless for honourable members opposite to endeavour to fasten pro-German views on those who Under the circumstances, take a different view of the situation, for such an attitude can only rebound on themselves. The honourable member for Wentworth made reference to a threat said to have been made by the honourable member for Brisbanei n Sydney. I have made no such threat, and I am prepared to respect anything said to me in confidence. There is, however, a l i m it to this. When I hear gentlemen making statements on the platform -that are in direct contradiction to statements' which they have made in -secret, what can be done to refute them?

I have been much associated with Germans in every State, and I am not ashamed of the fact, for it was from Germans that I learnt my Democracy. The men who lived in the rebel year of 1848 were my teachers, and these were the men who, if they had their way, would not allow a kaiser or a king to exist, and who helped to drive the grandfather of the present German Emperor out of Berlin. believe to be as genuine Australians as any born here, and unless they are proved to be guilty of disloyalty, it is only decency on our part to give them credit for loyalty. Their fathers left their country to escape the infamy of conscription, and we ought to treat them as good citizens, unless we find them unworthy of trust. There are guilty Germans who ought to be interned, but who are allowed to walk the streets of Melbourne simply, in my opinion, because they are possessed of wealth. I am now alluding to those connected with the well known rubber company in Australia, one of whom was so contemptible that when he was naturalized and swore fealty, changing his name in the process, he must have heen a spy. He was a major in the Eorces, and, as a member of the Automobile Club, was gaining information about our roads; and yet that swell f r ill and feathers Riverina, passing hy him at the time, club, the Army and Navy Club, allowed him to resign. That man ought to have been put in gaol, for internment is too good for him. There were two oaths and two pledges of honour given in this connection, hut his rich colleague in the company is drawing a big salary, and, just because he ia a rich man, he can calmly smoke his cigar up Collins-street. tion of this subject this morning is most unfortunate, and I do not suppose there are three honourable members opposite who do not regret it. The honourable member for Wentworth spoke of the self-importance of the honourable member for Brisbane, but those who heard the former gentleman. in spite of all his advantages of a university education, beating the wind in an endeavour to cover up what he had said, must have thought they were listening to some barnstormer.

The Prime Minister was asked the date of the document when it was first produced, hut he was conveniently deaf. There is, however, no escape for the right honourable gentleman, for the honourable member for told him that honourable members had asked for the date of the document. However, neither the honorahle member for Wentworth nor the Prime Minister were "" game "" enough to give the date, although it was on the document, not only in German, but in English. The date is distinctly stated as the 31st May. that the electors are asked to put a 'cross opposite the name of the honourable member for Brisbane shows, as plainly as the ten commandments in a church, that it was the election year.

Will the Prime Minister permit the explanation to be published in the same way as the document was published? orable member for Wentworth is unworthy of him, and I am only sorry he is not here at the present moment. When the honourable member used a word sounding like "" coward,"" he recalled to my mind a time in the Victorian Parliament when the late William Shiels assailed the late Sir James Patterson, and by using the words "" cowered in a corner"" conveyed a meaning quite different from that of the words themselves. the honourable member for Brisbane would tremble at this whipper-snapper! It is laughable to think of such a thing. The honourable member for Wentworth, in the course of his remarks, said that he would do away with the German language if he could. The honourable member, as a university man, ought to know that, at the Melbourne University, no one is allowed to pass in modern languages in the Public Service examination without showing his proficiency in German. I regret that I cannot speak German. HadI been able to do so, I should not have been landed in a police office in Berlin ia 1911 because of my friend's bad accent. The German police were the only civil functionaries that we discovered on that occasion. A great American author has stated that most of the words in the English language are Saxon, which is the pure German tongue of the German race. Our university, some of whose professors are yelping as loudly ,as they can on the public platform, should give students the choice between, say, French, German, Italian, and Russian, instead of compelling them to learn German and French. I resent the compulsion to learn any language. The attitude in regard to modern languages is nearly, as bad as used to be the attitude in regard to ancient languages. God knows how many heads have ached and minds have wearied in the learning of Latin and Greek, which has been of so little use to those who have learned them ! I commend the honourable member for Brisbane for having defended himself, and I am sorry that the honourable member for Wide Bay got into the position in which he was placed. When a stone is thrown from the other side it is sure to rebound. throwing to suppress a date? What has occurred does not tend to increase the good feeling between honourable members. The honourable member for Wentworth loves to cause an outburst, and then to laugh and joke about it. He is never really serious. He made use of a word which sounded like "" coward,"" but no one would accuse of being afraid, the happytempered, pleasant-minded member for Brisbane, who has always a smile on his lips and a laugh in his eyes, and can' take Just as if the hardest hits good temperedly. Is there anything wrong in this appealMr Finlayson is a member of the Labour party, and he has loyally supported the legislation of that party which has extended the old-age and invalid pensions. A good many Germans draw pensions as a reward for many years' residence in this country. Old souls in my district have told me that they regret the war, and hope to a man that the Kaiser will be eliminated with the short shrift of a rope. Isi t thought that the Liberals would have brought in old-age and invalid pensions, or would have reduced the age limit to sixty years? How many times will it be necessary to make these walls echo with the statement that the honourable member for Flinders reduced the Victorian allowance for old-age pensions from £200,000 to £150,000 ?

MALONEY members of the party to which the honourable member for Wentworth belongs regret his action. Like the honourable member for Perth, I very much resent the imputation of the honourable member for Brisbane that Liberal members have cringed to the German vote. I have probably ten German electors in my division for every one in the Brisbane division, but I defy any one to say that either as a candidate or as a member of Parliament I have curried favour with that section of the community. I believe that a number of votes have been cast for me by Germans, and it shows their good sense when they vote for a man who is fearless in regard to them. I regret the sweeping charges which the honourable member for Brisbane has made. He ""should have been more specific. member regret what was done by the honourable member for Wentworth ? proceedings. It has troubled me very much since the beginning of the war that honourable members should consider the effect of their attitude towards the war upon the German vote. No nation can be safe whose representatives consider first the opinions of citizens of enemy origin. Our duty is to go straight ahead regardless of nationality. Roosevelt has said that he despises the man who has to be continually reminded of where he was born. That is my attitude. The honourable member for Melbourne said that the Prime Minister was conveniently deaf when asked to srive the date of the circular to which the honourable member for Wentworth drew attention. As a matter of fact, there is no date on it , and the only clue to the date is the appeal to vote for the honourable member for Brisbane on the 31st May. We know that, in The n I understand 1913, the Federal elections were held on that date. The honourable member ' for Brisbane has made a rather poor case for himself. His action reminded me of that of an innocent-looking fish which I once saw at a sea-side resort near Brisbane. On being touched w it h a stick, it scuttled away, leaving behind a cloud of inky fluid. The honourable member for Brisbane scuttled away, leaving a mess behonorable hind him. He threw out so much d i r t in order to cover up something which I feel sure that the may come out before the question is settled. Question resolved in the negative.

Provision is made for fenced yard on northern end of station, wherein is situated accommodation in connection with the' railway refreshment room and out-buildings.

The goods shed is situated at thc wharf, and has been erected Rome time. (3) The brick facing for the platform has been completed for a length of about. 300 feet, and on the longest face approximately 700 feet has still to be done. Excavation for all foundations is .complete, and about 75 per cent, of the foundations are laid. Twenty per cent, of the steel stanchions for the lower floor are erected, and 75 per cent, of the timber forms for concreting the piers on the eastern front of the building are erected in position; 2,200 cubic yards of stone arc on the site for the erection of the building. Contracts have been called for practically all material for the station building. Tenders for joinery ancl timber ancl verandahs cantilevers, &c, have already been let. Timber, galvanized-iron, &c, are on order for the carriage shed. Work in connection with preparing the site is now in hand. (4) Brick and concrete only have been used. (5) Estimated cost:-Station building, £16,000.: platform, £1,950; carriage shed, £8,000. Cost to date is recorded as £1,001.

These say they left their younger brothers to keep the home together. They would not object if a system were devisable requiring equal sacrifice by all families.

This amendment of the Estate Duty Assessment Act, and' the two other Bills to follow, are purely machinery measures, and all that honourable members need to satisfy themselves upon is whether it is necessary to appoint an Assistant Commissioner of Taxation. The Government have decided that it is. As the M in ister charged with the supervision of the various Departments of taxation, I assure honourable members that the work of the Commissioner of Taxation is so responsible and arduous that it is necessary to appoint an assistant. The Commissioner is charged with the administration of the Land TaxA c t , a measure of far-reaching importance, and difficult to administer; the Income TaxA c t , also highly technical, and bringing before the Minister in its operations many deputations of in dividuals who desire information, or complain of the working of the Act ; and the Estate Duty Assessment Act .

I felt I would injure that unfortunate man by trying to get his case before the Minister. I mentioned that to the Minister at an interview, and do not blame him for being a littl e stormy. PossiblyI deserved it . As I did not wish to injure the man, I bowed to the storm. I understand the man was accused of using departmental stationery by men who had gotinto trouble in connection with their income tax returns. The Minister showed me a letter on departmental paper which the man had opinion, wrongly; but if public servants were to be called to account for using departmental stationery or envelopes, about 95 per cent, of the Commonwealth servants would be in trouble. said that Mr Nelkin's answer should be made in writing, to which I agreed. Mr Nelkin then l e f t to make out his statement. I understand that a letter was then sent to him requesting that he should put in a sworn statement. That was the first'time. I have ever been asked to get a sworn statement from a citizen about a matter of which he had only a hasty knowledge through portions being read to him by the Minister. It is also the first time that. I have ever been asked that a trade unionist and Labour man should make a sworn declaration on charges that had not been put before him. wrote to the Treasurer for a copy of the charges that he was to answer on oath. I do not know whether all the charges were sent to him, for the Minister knows that I handed the case over to a senator in order not to prejudice the man's cause on account of the difference between the Minister and myself. ber's remarks appear to be connected with the Income Tax Department.

That is my answer to that sort of remark. I know the Minister too well for him to talk in that way. I do not object to the proposed appointment, no matter who the man is. If it is Mr Ewing, I think he has tried his best to make up for the infamous wrong that he did to the man to whom I have just been referring. If he is the man to be selected, I shall be satisfied. I understand that the Acting Public Service Commissioner w ill appoint him, and I do not want the Minister to think I am hittin g at Mr Ewing. He is a good man, who made an unfortunate used, in my mistake, which has helped to r u in a man and his wife and family, and the M i nister does not seem disposed to help t h a i unfortunate individual out of his trouble.

I understand that the matter to which I wished to refer can be considered more -appropriately under this B ill . In the administration of our income tax law, we are losing vast sums of money every year through the lack of a proper intelligence department to discover those who seek to rob the country by failing to send in income tax returns, and by avoiding the payment of the tax. The late Mr McKay made some provision, for an in telligence branch with the help and assistance of a man named Nelkin. He personally expressed to me his satisfaction with the work of this man, though he admitted that he was perhaps a little too abrupt. honourable member to indulge in a discussion of the administration of the Department on the motion now before the House. matter on the adjournment ? the honourable member that there is now a B i ll before the House containing a certain principle, and on the second reading the debate must be confined to the discussion of the principles of a B ill . Details of administration of a Department might be discussed at length on the Estimates, but to permit such a discussion on the second reading of a B ill would be to consent to a course of procedure which would make it almost impossible to get any B ill through the House. I find that in clause 2 it is proposed to amend section 5 of the Principal Act by providing for an Assistant Commissioner of Taxation, who shall have, and may exercise, such functions as are prescribed, or as are delegated to him by the Commissioner. Clause4 provides thatSection7 of the principal Aet is amended by inserting after the words "" The Commissioner "" ber may not discuss the details of the B ill on the motion for the second reading.

It is commonly stated that no tax imposed is the cause of so much lying, deceit, and injustice as is an income tax, although, with all its faults, it will be admitted that there is no better means of raising taxation. We have wisely, in our income tax legislation, differentiated more widely than has been done in Great Britain between incomes derived from land and property and incomes derived from personal exertion. I believe that honourable members are in agreement with I cannot allow the me when I say that considerable difficulty arises from the fact that we have both Federal and State income taxes. Some procedure should be adopted to avoid the necessity for the making of separate returns for the State and the Commonwealth. I make the suggestion to the I may explain to Treasurer that, at the earliest opportunity, he should frame regulations under which Federal income tax returns might be based upon returns sent in in connection with the State income tax. This' would save a very great deal of work. It would prevent the duplication of work by Government Departments. It would save time, paper, and postage.

I hope that the Minister will do as I suggest. As only one pensioner goes into a hospital to every ten that go into a benevolent asylum, the cost will not be much. I do not wish to interfere with the present arrangement, under which the pensioner gets arrears of four weeks' pension on leaving an institution. I speak on behalf of the hospitals, because I do know the splendid work that they do, and the expenses which they have to meet.

The hospitals stitutions whose inmates, if old-a'ge penare willing to take charge of old-age pensioners, may continue to receive money from the Government.

That is true of the country districts at large. There old age pensioners must go into the ordinary nublic hospitals. pitals become benevolent asylums. as such. Under section 45 of the Act, if a pensioner becomes an inmate of an asylum for the insane, or of a hospital, his pension is suspended. When he is discharged, the payment of the pension is resumed, and he is entitled to four weeks' instalment of pension in respect of the period of suspension, if that period has continued for four weeks. Under another provision, a magistrate may commit a pensioner to an institution, in which case the institution benefits. the part of the Commonwealth. of the law, for which the honourable gentleman was not responsible. In a country district there are only the hospitals for the old-age pensioners to go to, and the Treasurer, by refusing to amend an anomaly in the law, makes a pensioner a beggar when he knocks at the door of such an institution. But the Commonwealth, having undertaken to provide old-age pensions, should not throw a pensioner back on the sioners, and are doing so, but they should be put by the Commonwealth in the same position as other institutions. ""When a pensioner goes into a public hospital, he is deprived of his pension, and nothing is paid to the hospital for his keep. The Government did right in taking over from the State the business of dealing with old-age pensions, and it should not throw pensioners back on the States when they become ill. Our Dublic hospitals are kept going only through the efforts of those who undertake tlieir management without charge, and are supported by public contributions and small State subsidies. WhatI ask ia that hospitals may be placed in the same position as benevolent asylums.

Treasurer should be aware that most of our public hospitals depend entirely upon public subscriptions and Government subsidies. I ask the Treasurer, therefore, to consider carefully their position in regard to old-age pensioners. The donation from the Government depends upon the amount raised by public subscription, and during this time of war, when every one is being taxed heavily, I am afraid that the voluntary contributions to the hospitals w ill decrease considerably. The consequence w ill be that the poorer people w i ll suffer. I hope the Treasurer will give this aspect of the question due consideration. Amendment agreed to.

I know of instances Section 46 of the DefenceA c t provides1. The Governor General may, in time of war, by proclamation, call out the Citizen Forces or any part thereof for active service. 2. The proclamation shall state the reason for calling out the Forces. 3. If the Parliament is sitting the reason for calling out the Forces shall forthwith be communicated by the Governor General to both Hpuses of the Parliament. 4. If the Parliament is not sitting at the date of the issue of the proclamation, it shall be summoned to meet within ten days after that date. If the House carries this motion it will be deprived of the opportunity of discussing the proclamation and the reasons for it . I believe that the Government do not in tend to call out the men under the DefenceA c t . I believe that they intend to pose, and thus avoid submitting to Parliament reasons for their action. They should adhere to the method laid down in the DefenceA c t , a measure which was passed in times of peace. A t any rate, they should be candid enough to tell the House what method they intend to follow. I am raising no factious opposition to the motion, but I feel that Parliament should meet after the proclamation is like this position in the history of Australia. We know that the peculiar disturbing the minds of the people. men are not to be called up for home defence, but are to be prepared to go to mative. If that be the case, why make any pretence about the proclamation ? In to issue a proclamation with that object under the Defence Act, I am of opinion that the Government intend to resort to the War Precautions Act, and I do not to see followed on a f u t u re occasion.

TheA c t distinctly says that the Governor General shall give his reasons, per medium, of course, of the PrimeM in ister or Ministeri n charge at the time; and in the drafting and consideration of the DefenceA c t , both originally and in the several amendments made since, due consideration was given to the seriousness of issuing a proclamation of the kind. I well remember that, when the DefenceB ill was before Parliament, honourable members on both sides were determined that no power should be placed in the hands of any Ministry to do as they thought fit on such occasions, and provision was made for a proper discussion of the matter by Parliament, as is shown by the fact that if Parliament is not sitting at the time it must be called together within ten days. Of course, in other Acts the Ministry very properly have the power to issue proclamations, the time being lef t to their discretion. This was the case in the amendment of the Invalid and Old-age PensionsA c t , when the age of the women pensioners was reduced to sixty, the idea being to allow the Government to issue a proclamation when in their opinion the finances of the country would permit of the change. might be l e f t in the case of a Tariff change, it being l e f t to the Government to say when, in their opinion, the inrush of foreign productions was imperilling the industrial life of the country. In the case of the DefenceA c t , however, that cannot be done, for the reasons I have stated. It would be quite, possible for any Government, when the House was not sitting, to issue a proclamation which is the use of they knew would result in their overthrow had Parliament been in session. I desire to know from the Government the T h a t may be; b u t constitutional reasons they have for their action, for , up to the present, we have had no reasons of the kind . The Prime Minister told us that if , at the end of the month, 32,500 men had not enlisted voluntarily he would act under the sections of the DefenceA c t relating to home defence; but. as I have already said, he has also told us that the men All the Ministers are in are being called up, not for home defence, but in order to be trained for foreign service. That is a reason that could not honourable be given according to the Defence Act. Iu is pretty evident that under the War Precautions Act anything may be done; and there is a case in point in the Government action in fixing prices, which had been declared ultra vires by Mr. Justice Griffith and Mr Justice Barton. If Parliament has no power to do certain things, it certainly has not the power to delegate others to do them. If the Government may resort to the War Precautions Act to do anything they desire, it will not be long before we have martial law, and Parliament w ill not be necessary. Under martial law, or even under the W a r Precautions Act, the Government could deny the right of Parliament to deal with the finances, and take the management into their own hands. If honourable members permit the introduction of the thin edge of the wedge in this way, they, as caretakers of the people's rights, are running great risks. I , for one, do not intend to take any risks, and, therefore, I voice my objection to the proposal before the House. The Prime Minister ought really to tell the House under what law he intends to make the proclamation on Monday, for it is only just that Parliament and the people should know. It requires ' no stretch of imagination to believe that, after the proclamation is issued on Monday, there may be great unrest in AusThe same sort of discretion tralia. Indeed, it has come to my knowledge within the last hour that the unrest has already started, although no information of the fact has been made public in Melbourne. On Monday night, at BrokenH ill , forty policemen, armed with batons, made a raid on a meeting.

283,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,"Prime Act that has been in force for fifteenthe necessity arises. It is an issue which, perhaps, cannot be evaded. But I hope that common sense and loyalty, not only loyalty to the Empire but loyalty to themselves, will inspire the citizens of the Commonwealth at this moment. hope that no man, no matter what his private feelings may be, no matter how much he may oppose the proposals of the Government, will endeavour to take the law into his own hands. I appeal to every person in this country to have respect for the laws for which he or she, as the case may be, is responsible. In this Commonwealth the laws are made, not by some dictator, not by some despot, or by some narrow clique who have snatched to themselves by some means the power to govern the country, but the whole body politic. whose circumstances are so mean but that he has a vote equal to that of the most powerful and wealthy in the community. Therefore, to revolt against the Government in those circumstances is to revolt against themselves. free country make its laws, and if they make them they must abide by them. When they like those laws no longer let them repeal them in a proper and constitutional manner. That is the position, and upon it this Parliament may safely stand. We are not going into recess. We do not propose to enjoy a period of leisured inactivity, but are going to brave the storms of popular criticism and to speak to the people that which we believe to he right. If there is any man in this House who seeks to stop us, who seeks to debar the people from exercising the fundamental rights of citizenship, let him so declare himself, but unless he does so, he is hound by the principles of Democracy to welcome, and not retard, the motion to allow Parliament to get before the people. SoI say the Government have nothing to apologize for. We cannot, and we ought not to, deviate from the course we have laid down. It is a course compatible with the gravity of the situation in which we find ourselves and with principles of government to which all parties in the country have given their adherence. I hope that in this coming campaign members on both sides will remember that they are citizens of a free country, and that they will come to the consideration of this, the gravest question Mr Hughes. that has ever been presented to the citizens of any Democracy, in a spirit of pure reasonableness. I know that I should waste my breath in urging that counsel upon all men, but I do urge it upon I those men who are entitled to he called Democrats and who by their acts prove themselves worthy of the privileges of citizenship in a free country. If we do that, whatever the issue may be, we shall have no cause to reproach ourselves. Whether the country assents or dissents upon this question, we at any rate will have done our duty; but if we endeavour to silence reason by abuse, and to cloud the real question by a thousand and one side issues, and to distract public attention and fill the people's minds with vaguo and misleading ideas, then upon our head There is no man will he the responsibility. I , for one, am going to tell the people what I believe to be true and necessary. I have said over and over again that every member of the House has the opportunity to put his views before the public without fear and The citizens of a without favour. There is no restriction upon others, and there is none upon me. When we reassemble the issue will have been settled. Parliament will then have to meet the situation as it exists, and if we fight this battle honestly and fairly I do not think there is any one of us who will need reproach himself with the position as he then finds it , no matter what that position may be. appreciate the spirit in which the Prime Minister has spoken, and will endeavour to reciprocate it. So far as concerns the referendum which is to be taken.on the 28th October, I think the position is quite clear. It is in the highest degree unfortunate that the Prime Minister was ever deluded into initiating a policy of violence in this country, a policy which rests upon the violent seizure of Australian citizens for military service abroad. He has done that, and I intensely regret it. I helieve, with other honourable members, that the vast majority of the people in this Commonwealth will repudiate the proposals and reject the referendum by a negative vote. That, however, relates to something which is to occur on the 28th October. WhatI should like some information upon, and that is a point which the Prime Minister has skilfully evaded, is the proclamation which he says it is",31,Special Adjournment
284,Mr Brenna N (Batman) [3.55],"Iproposed to issue at au early date. That proclamation is to be issued under powers which were vested in the Government by a Defence Act for what is well known as home defence. And although there are persons in this chamber now who would have us believe that there is no distinction between home defence carried on in a foreign country and home defence in Australia, there is not one of them but knows well that the Defence Act in its present form would never have been passed if that vital distinction had not been insisted upon. at the time? insisted upon by the Prime Minister himself times out of number. If the distinction had not been recognised the principle of compulsion in the Defence Act would never have been accepted. Nay, there is scarcely a public man who would not have been hooted off the platform if he had dared to say that conscription under the Defence Act included compulsion of Australian citizens to go 13,000 miles outside the Commonwealth to fight in a foreign country. I have addressed myself at sufficient length already to that aspect of the question. But I wish to know where the Prime Minister stands in regard to this proclamation. Under the Defence Act he has power to call up the citizens of Australia for home defence, and if Parliament is sitting the reasons for that drastic and extraordinary action must be put before the House immediately. If the House is not sitting, so urgent is the matter that members must he called from the four corners of the Commonwealth within ten days to hear the reasons why the proclamation is issued. The Government are under a legal obligation to put their reasons before the House, and that obligation they propose to evade. the Act says shall he done. The Prime Minister has told us that the House is to go into recess, and that the proclamation is to be issued ahout the first day of next month. going into recess. ister has said, Parliament is not going for the defence of Australia? into a recess of leisured ease, but it will adjourn to engage in the referendum campaign. The view I am putting to the House is that the Governor General-and that, I apprehend, means the Government-is under an obligation to state to the House reasons why this very drastic proclamation is to be issued. If I have failed to understand the Act, the least the Prime Minister could have done was to give the House some explanation of the legal position. The Act is clear. Section 46 provides(1) The Governor General may, in time of war, by proclamation, call out the Citizen Forces, or any part thereof, for active service. (2) The proclamation shall state the reason for calling out the Forces. (3) If the Parliament is sitting, the reason for calling out the Forces shall forthwith be communicated by the Governor General to both Houses of the Parliament. (4) If the Parliament is not sitting at the date of the issue of the proclamation, it shall be summoned to meet within ten days after that date. playing on the fact that the House is still sitting. That is why the honourable, member insisted that we are not going into recess, and that, technically speaking, the House would still be sitting, ignoring the vital fact that it is not a matter of technicalities, but a matter of duty on the part of the Government to communicate reasons to the House, in order that honourable members may inform their minds as to their sufficiency. tinuous session from the first meeting after the elections. tinuous session, but that does not affect my point. In regard to this vital matter, it is clearly of importance that the intention pf the provision in the Act is that Parliament should be informed of the reasons, and have an opportunity of deliberating on them. The Prime Minister is not prepared to give those reasons, because he knows that by divulging them he would be put out of court and stand politically convicted of an illegal act; because the proposal is to call up these men not for home service, and not for the defence of Australia.",32,Special Adjournment

Mr ""WATT -Yes; let us talk about the matter quietly. be disturbed in the least by the violent jingoism of the-honourable member. I urge that the importance of this point cannot be over-estimated. The Prime Minister does not wish to submit these reasons to the House, because they will not bear examination. If some special set of circumstances had arisen in Australia, if a state of war within the confines of the Commonwealth of Australia was threatened or impending, or if some special emergency was arising, the Prime Minister would have the right and! the. power to exercise this extraordinary authority; but. on the platform and in the House he has already stated .that the object of exercising this special power, which was given to him for defence-within Australia, is to yard men forthepurpose of sending them outside Australia if , unfortunately, the people of Australia should give himthe authority to' do so. My belief is that the proposed proclamation, is wholly illegal. It is said that the Governor General may, in time of war; issue such a proclamation. What is the definitionof war?

He has urged the people to a condition, of mind of sweet reasonableness ihregard to the whole thing, though he has initiated a policy which, as to the referendum, was conceived in violence and is proposedtobe carried out in violence, and, as to the proclamation, proposes to throw the whole of the Commonwealth into a condition of chaos and confusion. The Prime Minister proposes to withdraw men from their occupations, and to throw industry and production into confusion. He proposes to bustle into camp a body ofmen-, hundredsof whom will be physically unfit, and hundreds of whom will be exempted in other ways, and allow them to' wait there while leisurely tribunals will determine whether they are fit to serve or not. I have never heard amore impracticable policy than that which was put before the House by the Prime Minister this afternoon in soairy a fashion. He asks us to accept it with sweet reasonableness. It is the very antithesisof sweet reasonableness, and, from itsnature, will lead to confusion, chaos, and lossj and is bound to end in disaster.

The honourable gentleman has expressed the willingness of the Government that the Inter-State Commission should inquire into the matter, provided that the agreements between the Commonwealth and Queensland Government, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and tlie Millaquin Company are not brought under review. Why tie the hands, of the Inter-State Commission? Why notlet the Commissioners inquire into every phase, of the question? They are able men, and can be trusted tq do their work properly. sugar industry in Queensland is at stake. influence on the settlement of the coastal districts of the State, and we need settlers. yesterday that the salvation of the country lies in men on the land. As far as my lights go, the Federal Government have the settlement of this question in their own hands, and in the interests of the industry and the people of Australia, it is their duty to deal with it at once. I should, like to bring under the notice of the Treasurer certain statements which appeared in the columns of the daily press in. regard, to those who w ill come within the scope of the proposed new taxation. I notice that those persons are already preparing to evade that taxation, and to pass it on to the masses of the public. U n sociated with postal work, who, though fortunately, the. great bulk of taxation in this country in the past has been passed on to the masses, and under the new proposals of the, Government, which I admit to be wise and sane,. I am afraid'that the burden w ill be transferred to the general body of the public. I do not know whether the Treasurer intends to propose means by which this passing on. of taxation can be prevented. This matter has always presented a problem, and it w ill have to be solved in some way, because the masses of the people cannot stand f u r ther burdens than they are hearing to-day. it is impossible to prevent taxes being passed on to the consumers: quite agree w i th them. of the past did say that, because theGovernments in days gone by were not anxious to relieve the people of these burdens. problem ? made scheme to propound to-day, but I ask the Treasurer to take into seriousconsideration the devising, of means to. prevent the evil of which I am complaining.

I hope that the Treasurer w ill make the meshes of his net so small thatthose upon The Prime Minister said whom the. tax. is intended to f a l l shall not escape. Another matter to which I wish to call attention is the peculiar position of some men who are in the service of the Commonwealth. An order was issued by the ex-Prime Minister( Mr Fisher) that no promotions or appointments were to be made in the Public Serviceduring theterm of thewar. On the face of it that instruction appears very fair, because we do not wish to penalize those public servants who have gone to the front. As far as is possible, the positions and promotions of those men must he protected. But we have a large body of men, particularly among telephone mechanics and others asqualified for permanent appointment, do not know what day their services will be dispensed with. They have gone to considerable expense in qualifying themselves, and arestill attending technical schools, and to-day they are asking whether they are to continue doing this, to betold later that their services are no -longer required. Something should be done to give them a sense of security and permanencein regard to their position. They may be preparing themselves for positions that will never be open to them, and then they will be obliged to start life afresh in a new sphere.

The press will be acting unfairly to the people if they do not report at least some of the chief speakers on the anti-conscription side. Often it is the cutting down of speeches, and the consequent misrepresentation in the press, that irritates a large numher of men, and makes them feel that they are not receiving that fair treatment which is essential in dealing, with a question like this. I should have liked to have seen the arguments for and against conscription published at equal length in a manifesto to the people, and if that had been done I doubt very much whether it would have been necessary for members of Parliament to take tlie platform in order to educate the people on the subject. It would have been a good thing if we could have refrained from platform controversy. Unfortunately, that is not possible, and the duty devolves upon all of us to endeavour to impress our convictions upon the public. In doing that I hope that we shall all so comport ourselves on the platform that, after the decision is given, we may return to our places with the feeling that we have done nothing to he ashamed of. We shall have done our best, and, whatever the verdict is, it will be for us as decide upon some other immediately. a Parliament to honour and abide by it.

'Finally, I offer my protest to conscription as we will have it under the provision has been on the statute-book for fifteen years, and it could have been utilized for calling up men for the defence of Australia for home service; but the assumption on which they are to be called up on Monday next is that, if the referendum vote is cast in a certain way, they are to be used for service abroad, and there is no essential difference between that method and calling up men for compulsory service outside the Commonwealth.

We are going to ask the people to vote on a matter which affects a section only, and which does not concern a great many of those who will go to the ballot-box.

Many of the young men whose services will be required in the direction of repairing a great deal of the ruin that has been occasioned will have to present themselves to the military authorities on Monday; and, owing to the number of Courts,, tribunals, and places of appeal that they will have to pass through, the war will possibly be over before they can get away again; because, if we are to be guided by the prediction of the Prime Minister, the war will be over by June next. I have already received letters asking me whether young fellows will have vo present themselves on Monday next, and I know that there, is sadness in some of their homes, because, besides sustaining damage to their property, they have lost relatives through the floods. In addition to the injustice of the matter, their positions will be rendered very much worse by their having to present themselves to the military authorities at this particular time-.

I have in my possession telegrams from the United Cane-growers Association and the Sugar-millers Association, stating that they are prepared to accept the appointment of the Inter-State Commission to hold this inquiry. There remains the third party-the labour employed. see how the Treasurer can be sincere in asking any honourable member what the labourer wants. It is the cane-grower and the sugar-miller who have to provide the means for payingfor the labour. labourer neednot work unless he gets the pay that he wants. The two parties who are interested in this question are. the -sugar-growers and the mill-owners, andi, as they have given their consent, I hope that the Treasurer will not delay this all important matter, and that he will allow the crop to be taken off. To paraphrase an old saying of the Romans, "" We who are about to"" die salute y o u , "" I say to the Treasurer, "" Those who are now about to die through the closing of the sittings of the House are going to beat you on the 28th October."" In letters written to me, some of the soldiers at the f r o n t have discussed the question of the referendum. I know that they will not vote to compel their fellow men to be slaves instead of free men-. I have inquired fro m twelve mothers who have sons at the front. They havevisitedmy office-, and I have not sought to change their opinions; but out of the twelveofthem, eleven intend to votei against conscription.
