It has a wide entrance with deep water, capable of approach in a l l kinds of weather. It has not the disadvantage of surrounding reefs such as have many other harbors. Hebrides are 'also the Segond Channel and Port Sandwich, which are capable of being used as naval bases. If the Condominium breaks down, and if those harbors are fortified and become the possession of France, and that country becomes hostile to us, those islands w ill be a most serious menace to our shipping ancl to the Australian coast. ""Unfortunately, we, as Australians, have not done as much as we should to preserve the trade of those islands for Australia, and to people those places with British colonists. An attempt -of a spasmodic character to colonize them was made some few years ago, ancl a few settlers went to the New Hebrides, the idea being to increase the number of settlers to such an extent as to have ultimately a predominance of British settlers, and thus enable us to present a strong case for the exchange with France of those, islands for some other territory of more importance to her from a commercial and strategic Stand-point. Unfortunately, immediately after we sent settlers there, we erected a tariff wall against the admission of their products to Australia, their only market; ancl as a result of these adverse conditions, created by our own foolish action, many of those settlers abandoned their holdings. Some of them even swore allegiance to the French flag. The resultto-day is that French occupation is more than double that of the British. -The honourable member's time has expired. desire to support the motion of the right honourable the PrimeM in is t e r and to congratulate l i i m on his work at the Imperial and Economic Conferences. W h a t about the trade of While at certain times all political parties must, necessarily, consider things from a I am just party stand-point, at least we on this side of the House, when discussing questions of Empire defence and reciprocal trade, have sufficient perspective and a sufficient appreciation of the relative value of things, to sink for the time being party This considerations, and to concentrate upon bigger things. Wheni t comes to quesThe harbour of Havana tions of great moment, such as Empire defence and reciprocal trade, we realize that party banners are very little flags compared with the Union Jack. The Imperial Conference and defence, and the Economic Conference and Empire trade, A t New are very closely interwoven. Without defence we cannot depend on maintaining an overseas trade, and without an overseas trade Australia will remain undeveloped. There are many opinions regarding defence. Some persons have no ideas on defence at all, or are afraid to state them. There are those who believe that we need no defence beyond the League of Nations. There are those who believe, or affect to believe, that the League of Nations is now in a position that makes it unnecessary for us to defend ourselves but by any other means. Tliere are those who believe that we should adopt some method of defence, but that we should defend our own shores only. There are those-by f ar the greatest number-wh o believe that we must defend Australia and our ocean trade, in co-operation with the rest of the Empire. We need not waste very much time on those who have no ideas on defence, or are afraid to state them. The point that was raised by the honourable .member for Lang( Sir Elliot Johnson) is worthy of emphasis, that the gentlemen, who to-day are silent, and who do not state their beliefs concerning defence, are the very honourable members who, last session, were most loud in their demand that the Prinie Minister, on his return from the Imperial Conference, should give ample opportunity for them to have a voice in deciding our means of",35,Setup

I , too, have the greatest possible respect for the League of Nations, ancl I hope that it will, in time, become a mighty instrument for theprevention of war. I also hope that later it will become the League of all the Nations, and that that other great English-speaking nation, at present holding aloof) will join the League, especially in view of the fact that it was first proposed by one of that nation's greatest citizens, since deceased. But, until the League of Nations is in a position to do away with war, we must be prepared to defend our shores. The subject of defence always reminds me of the words of Oliver Cromwell, who told his Ironsides to trust in God, but to keep their powder dry. Although we must do all we can to foster and to encourage the League of Nations, and should have the most amicable intentions towards all the nations of the world, yet, at the same time, we, too, should lseep our powder dry. Mr B-KEN.JST.AN -Does the honourable, member recommend the Oromwellian policy ? ease in my own way. There are some who think that, if we had a perfect machine in the League of Nations, we should require no force of any description to^ compel its decisions ; but, as with our civil law, we need some kind of force, so we must have force behind the League, even i i none other than the police force. It seems to me that a nation that holds out the hand of friendship and endeavours to impress other nations with the necessity for disarmament,, can do so with greater effect if it is itself strong. If a nation that is to be feared iu a naval or military sense, makes a great effort to induce other nations, perhaps less strong than itself, to disarm-, its proposals are met with greater respect than would be accorded to a similar proposal coining from a weak nation. In the latter case, the suspicion would be aroused that the proposal was put forward in timidity and in fear of the future. If we castour minds back over two decades to the South African war, we have an example of the different re* suits that come toa nation that holds out the hand of friendship, firstly when it is There are those whobelieve weak, and secondly when, it is strong-.. When Great Britain suffered a-, sexejrei reweise at Majuba, the magnanimity of Gladstone was Misconstrued by thevictors! as weakness, and' it was many years before British prestige was restored in South; Africa. Two decades later., when Great Britain, after a display of strength, in. the late South African war, held out. the hand of friendship and peace to the defeated Boers, the result was very different. G-reat Britain, almost immediately after the war offered thefranchise to both friend and foe-, with; the result that General Botha became Prime Minister of South Africa: and he was followed by aman of the. calibre of General Smuts. Greater effectsin the way of peace are brought about by a, nation which is strong than, by a nation, which is weak, and much more good will be done in tlie cause of peace if the; British Empire, in endeavouring foster and to encouragethe League of Nations,, nevertheless maintains its naval strength. Then we come to those who believe that-tin some vague way we can defend these shores unaided. Most of those who hold that view prefer, when ib suits their purpose, toremain under tlie protection of theBritislifl'ag, but to have completeliberty of action when theMother Country may be facingnational disaster. Such people think we have little in common with the people of. the. other great Dominions that make up the British Empire, ancl hold, that in some way we should confine our attention to matters entirely within Australia. This cannot be said of the party to which I belong. Pour years ago,, when, we fought our first Federal election,, we made our position quite, clear.

In connection with that gathering, I remind honourable members that when I paid a well-deserved tribute to the PrimeM in ister for the work which he did in the interests of the primary producers of Australia and for his efforts to obtain preferential treatment for our primary products, the. whole-hearted applause with which my remarks were received evidenced the keen appreciation of the conference delegates for the great work which the Prime Minister had done for this country. I give my hearty support to the motion submitted by the Prime Minister. with the previous speakers in regretting that a very large section of the representatives of the people of Australia have not seen fit to voice their opinions in this much right to her views on this subject, House upon the report presented by the Prime Minister on the Imperial and Economic Conferences. there mentioned transcend in importance any subject thathas been dealt with in this Parliament. to be a self-contained people. admitted on all hands that, in order to develop this country to its fullest extent, it is essential that we should have adequate markets for our products. It is also admitted, I think, that the best outlet is thp Mother Country. We are all hoping to continue and to improve our trade with; Great Britain. This being so, I am very much surprised .at the attitude of the Opposition in connection with the important matter of defence. One would have thought that, in view of the stand taken by the various organizations repre-. sented by honourable members opposite, tliey would have been prepared to increase substantially the Commonwealth defence vote, and, more than any other section of this House, have given warm support to the establishment of the Singapore Naval Base. They preach the doctrine of good-will between all nations, and act as if they were the only pebbles on the beach ; as if we i u Australia were the only people who had any right to consideration whatever. I have in mind a recent incident in this port of Melbourne. We had a ship, the A raluen, for which we could find no use ourselves, so we sold her to a foreign country. Japan, the country to which I refer, sent a crew to man the ship and take her away. tain repairs were needed, although according to Lloyd's survey she was not unseaworthy, and so the powers behind the Opposition brought pressure to bear to have all this work carried out in Australia. A great deputation waited upon the Minister for Trade ancl Customs( Mr Austin Chapman), urging him. to hold up the ship and to force her into clock for extensive repairs. They even desired to board this ship, flying the Japanese flag, and criticise the work that was being carried out. Their action certainly constituted an in terference in international affairs, and I suggest that people who are prepared to indulge in pin-pricks in ""that way should also be ready to defend themselves and I join this country against the results of their action. It is all very well to talk about White Australia. Japan is a country bf coloured people, ancl she has just as ancl be black if she chooses, ng Australia has to be regarded as a white man's counThe problems try. Therefore, when she buys a ship for which we eould find no use, she ought to be free of any interference. The vessel We rlosire had been lying idle for two or three years. It is We ought to have been glad to get something for her and let her be taken away. It was not that there was a risk of Japanese being drowned in the ship. The Japanese Government is just as careful of its citizens as we are of ours. The fact was that the Labour unions of Australia were anxious to get the repairs to the ship done here to fleece the Japanese. The Fordsdale cost something approaching £800,000, and I suppose we shall be asked to write that amount down by £550,000 before she carries a ton of cargo. The Japanese do not wish for their ships to be handled under conditions like that. The point is that we have a party in this House that is too ready to give p in pricks to other nations. The taking up of such aselfish attitude as that adopted by .some honourable members causes more international dissension than anything else. If lionorable members desire to take up such a position, they must be prepared to defend it . It is no good being like the schoolboy who says, "" I Avill fight you kneeling w it h one hand behind my back."" We are not so situated that we can adopt that stand. Some honourable members suggest that they want Australia to be self-contained, that they do not wish the Cerhelp of the Mother Country, and that",36,Setup
5,Mr Prowse (Forrest) [3.26],"they do not want the Singapore Base. Wc cannot reasonably take up that attitude when a nation much more powerful than our own is concerned in tlie matter. I ani quite satisfied that every honourable member of this House desires peace, and nob war.. Nations to succeed. But its success can only be achieved when the* world has reached a state of complete unity. Until that time arrives, we must be prepared to defend ourselves, and our trade. -Quite a number of those who defend the pacifist views held by the Opposition expect this country to develop its resources, and profitably employ its citizens, but we are not going the right way to work to do that. I noticed that one of the city papers referred the other day to Mr Suttor's visit to Japan, and attached blame to this Parliament because of its inertness in developing trade between Australia .and Japan. pointed out that Australia had developed si trade with Japan, amounting to £13,000,000 a year, but that since the Japanese earthquake America had taken, that away from us. have happened? mistake for us not to develop trade with Japan. may agree that we should develop commercial relationships with that country, but I ask how many of them would be prepared to enter into a reciprocal agreement? I submit, Mr Speaker, that if we are to develop trade with other nations, we must be prepared to make reciprocal agreements. Great possibilities exist for trading with the people surrounding us. The trouble is that Australians are not willing to reciprocate. Their attitude is, ""We will take everything, but we will give nothing."" If honourable, members adopt such an attitude, they must be prepared to defend it. I believe that it is a wrong stand to take. I am greatly surprised that honourable members opposite do not make some attempt to offer a few tangible suggestions for thc defence of Australia. the Fordsdale.

That means that Ave shall pass on practically to one foundry £3,000 a year, or £60 a week, ivhich Ave really need not spend. That is like signing a promissory-note. The day comes when it must be met.

We must show to the people of the world that a White Australia is an efficient Australia. One of the most regrettable experiences I have had since my election to this Parliament is having to face an Opposition which is doing nothing and saying nothing when these important national and economic problems are before us. We desire to get through the business in a practical way, and to consider solidly these matters which are of the greatest importance to the country, yet the Opposition will not discuss them. They seem to me to be as obstinate as mules. congratulate the right honourable the Prime Minister upon the magnificent work he did for the Commonwealth of Australia during his visit abroad. took a very deep interest in his doings during the very trying time he had there. It was a trying time because of the change which occurred in political conditions while he was in England. He had matters of great importance to deal with, and handled them in such a way that I have renewed confidence in him. I feel that the affairs of Australia are perfectly safe in his keeping. I am impressed by his undoubted sincerity, and I am sure that is true of every one who is associated with him in this Parliament. I am not impressed, however, with the attitude of the Opposition on the matters now before us. Eveni f the. members of the Labour party generally were not prepared to express their views on these important subjects, I should like to have heard the Leader of the Opposition voice the opinior*? of his party. Opposition jiad given the House and the country the views of himself and bis followers upon these matters that are vital not only to Australia but to the Empire as a whole> I should have been glad to listen to his address. Because of the silence of honourable members opposite I have been wondering where they are heading. I regard Australia as. an inseparable part of the British Empire. Any legislation passed in this country, whether by the.. Federal or a State Parliament, must have its reflection throughout the. Empire. I should like members of the Opposition mony. honourable member who interjects to say whether he is in favour of Australia cutting the painter that connectsus with the British Empire. I give credit to the Leader of the Labour party in another place, who, whether speaking for the party or not, has declared, in no uncertain terms, that he stands for a Republic in Australia. He has been game enough to declare that he is prepared to fight tooth and nail for cutting the j>aiiiter with Great Britain, and establishing a Republic in this country. If that is the attitude of members of the Labour party in this House also, why do they not say so. There are men in the Labour party whom I believe to be. thoroughly loyal, but there is a Communistic section outside that has such a grip, I upon the Labour party that it is hoping to influence this House aud the people to accept the ju'ogramme of the Communists. There are honourable members opposite, who, I have no doubt would like to express their views in support of the unity of the Empire, but they dare uot do so because they are controlled by the Communistic section. We, on this side, are the Nationalist party because we represent the people, and stand for the maintenance of a virile and loyal people within Australia and the Empire. Let me remind some honourable members opposite that they have asserted in this chamber in previous sessions, and by correspondence have informed 'their colleagues in the Imperial Parliament, that if a British Cabinet were to dare to adopt a foreign policy without consulting the Parliaments of the Dominions, they would voice a protest against their action here. Yet beI f the Leader of the cause a Labour Government has come into power in the Old Country, when the Prinie Minister returns to this Parliament, and presents a programme full of national proposals, they will not say that the present British Cabinet has done, wrong in adopting a foreign policy without consulting this Parliament or the Parliaments of the other oversea Dominions,.
