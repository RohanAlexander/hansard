We welcomed the PM to the local area for an education forum titled 'Your School Our Future'. The forum was held at Brighton Secondary School, an outstanding school in South Australia, in the beachside suburb of Brighton. Even though it is not in my electorate, it is just outside it-on the border-and a lot of the students who attend Brighton are from the Hindmarsh electorate. So it was a great pleasure to have the Prime Minister there, to have a discussion with the principals from Amanda Rishworth's area and from my own area to discuss education and the future of our schools. The Brighton school jazz choir was fantastic-they had a young Buble in the making there! There were principals and parent reps from all over. This was the first of a series of forums that the Prime Minister will be holding around the country on the government education agenda. We know how important education is. We know that the foundation of prosperity and of the future of this nation is the education that we provide for our children. Being a father of two boys myself, I know how important it was for my kids to get an education, because I knew it was tied to their prosperity in life. It is important to be able to provide the types of education that children require. Of course, not all students will go on to university. SoI am very pleased about the trade training centres that have been announced in and around my electorate. For example, we have a magnificent engineering trade training centre at Thebarton Senior College and a catering trade training centre at St George College on South Road in Kate Ellis's electorate, which is the border of our two electorates. Again, it is a big feeder for my area. It is so important for those children who perhaps do not want to go on to university to have the ability to learn the trades whilst they are still at school so that when they do decide to take on a trade they already have some of those skills at hand. As a father myself, one of my two boys went on to university and finished his degree. The other one was never going to go to university-you could tell from a very young age. How wonderful it would have been if he had had a trade training centre to enable him to learn some of the skills he learnt while he was doing his apprenticeship. He would have finished his apprenticeship a couple of years earlier, and it would have been very beneficial. I am sure there are hundreds and hundreds of students around the country in the same situation. As I said, I was pleased that we could discuss these things with the Prime Minister and the principals in my electorate. I am sure education will be a big part of our future policies.

170,Mr Christensen (Dawson) (12:03,"So the Labor Party dogfight rolls on: clawing,today's Labor Party should be a cause for great embarrassment and shame. The dysfunction, the incompetence-the Midas touch in reverse, if you will-is very frightening indeed. I have taken the opportunity to sift through the smoking pile of broken promises this government has left in its wake-and it is a big pile-to see if there is a disaster looming in my backyard, in my electorate. On the fringe of the pile is a project on the fringe of my electorate of Dawson: the Peak Downs Highway. The people of Mackay, my constituents, are frustrated. Their desperate pleas for investment and infrastructure are falling on deaf ears. Along with WA, Mackay is a wealth-producing region for this nation, yet we have Labor governments in Queensland and in Canberra who happily suck all the money out of the region with no regard for the sustainability of their economic bonanza. But be careful what you wish for. You could end up with a pink batts program in your neighbourhood. The federal government has promised $120 million towards the state controlled Peak Downs Highway, and I am wondering how they can turn this into a disaster. Incidentally, $120 million is only a third of the funding needed, according to the Road Accident Action Group, a key local group that is trying to fight against road fatalities. The former Rudd government said this funding was linked to the mining tax but there is something fishy about that claim. We know from the budget that $120 million has been allocated but we do not know over what time period. We know the government says $5.6 billion is to come from the mining tax but those proceeds are to flow from 2014-15 onwards. We know, from the government's Nation Building website, that the timetable for the Peak Downs highway upgrade states: Construction is expected to commence early in 2014 and is scheduled for completion by early 2016. Even if the expenditure did not occur until commencement, money would have to be spent in early 2014, this being the 2013-14 financial year. But the mining tax does not raise income until the 2014-15 financial year, so this project will not be funded from the mining tax-it just cannot be. But the government claims otherwise. Where is the money coming from? Why have we been conned on where the money is coming from for the Peak Downs highway upgrade? Why, if it is not linked to the mining tax, is the highway upgrade happening after the next election? Why can't it happen how? The answer to all of these questions is that is just smoke and mirrors-another broken Labor promise, but this one is exposed before it is even broken. There will be no Peak Downs highway upgrade under this government because the money is not there to do it. This is such a very sly way to con the public on the Peak Downs highway.

As we all know, last week was Donate Life Week and the awards were a great way to end what was a very busy week in Canberra. One of the highlights of the week in Canberra was the Donate Life Walk around Lake Burley Griffin that ends with a well-deserved breakfast of egg and bacon, this year cooked by one of the MasterChef finalists at Regatta Point. This year, 2,000 people took part in the walk, which goes to show how much support there is for organ and tissue donation in Canberra. The walk has been held for six years-it used to be called the Terry Connolly Walk and now it is the Donate Life Walk-and it just keeps getting bigger and better every year. As usual, this year we had a mass of schools, public servants and businesses turning out for the event. It has always received very strong support from the Canberra community. I do encourage government schools to also attend the event. We have a great representation from the independent and Catholic schools in Canberra but we need greater representation from the broad public sector schools. While the walk is a chance for everyone to show their support for organ and tissue donation, Friday's awards were all about recognising the unsung heroes in our community. Many have experienced their own heartbreak having members of families who have passed on and having to make the choice about organ and tissue donation. However, they continue to advance the cause because they personally know how important it is. The awards were presented to seven very worthy recipients on Friday by the ACT Chief Minister Katy Gallagher, who is patron of Gift of Life, which is the leading non-government body in the ACT for organ and tissue donation. This year's recipients included Rick McQualter for the Annette Taylor Award for Community Service; Laurie and Marguerite Wiseman for the Matthew Reynolds Award for Community Service, who are the parents of Ben Wiseman and have been very active in the organ and tissue donation sector for years; Pat Siciliano, who is a board member of Gift of Life-I used to be on the board with him-for the Jenny Deck Award for Community Service; Dhale Brown for the Ben Wiseman Award for Healthcare; Greg Bayliss, well-known media personality in Canberra, for the Angus Fairbairn-Cody Award for Media Support; and David Gough for the Terry Connolly Award for Community Awareness Raising-the first year that that award had been conducted and David had just returned from driving around Australia to raise awareness. His daughter Melody died a number of years ago and she was also an organ and tissue donor. This year's events in Canberra were highly successful, as usual. I thank all those Canberrans who took part in the awards, particularly those who got out for the walk on Wednesday. It was a great turnout. I look forward to it being even bigger and better next year. Lieutenants Morant, Handcock and Witton sentencing of three Australian veterans at the Boer War. The Breaker Morant case, who was convicted in 1902 along with two others, Peter Handcock and George Witton, for executing Boer prisoners of war is, of course, embedded in our nation's psyche. On behalf of their descendants, who still seek but are unable access justice, I rise once again in this parliament to say that it is timely for the Australian government to do everything it can to assist the modernday descendants of these men to access a judicial review of this case. It is the case that the executions were conducted with extreme haste and without appeal. The Australian government was not informed until some two months after the events. At the same time around 80,000 Australians signed a petition to release George Witton and to pardon Morant and Handcock. Considering that at this time this represented about 2.5 per cent of Australia's population, this was an extraordinary number of people. Today, of course, it still remains in the psyche that this injustice could be perpetuated upon Australian soldiers in that the executions were done without fair process or judicial review. I last addressed this parliament on 15 March 2010 after a public hearing conducted by the Petitions Committee. On that occasion I described the case for the pardons as strong and",168,Constituency Statements
171,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (12:09,"I rise today to mark the 110-year anniversary of thecompelling. Given that other countries in recent times, including Canada and Ireland, have sought redress of injustices on behalf of the British in World WarI and have received same under the Defence Act 1903 and, given that the men who were executed-Morant, Witton and Handcock-led to the saving of hundreds of Australian soldiers' lives in World WarI because they were unable to be executed by the British because of what had happened in the Boer War, I think it is important that we seek British government's assistance in releasing all of the available records in relation to this case so that the modern day descendants can know what happened and rightly, if necessary, receive a judicial review and pardon. It is an episode that appeals greatly to every Australian because of the doctrine of fairness which says that no-one should be treated differently because of their birth, rank or status. We do know that these men were treated differently because of their birth, rank and status. We certainly need legends in Australian history. I note that the former Attorney-General Robert McClelland announced that he was persuaded by the evidence that had been submitted to him that these men may not have been tried and sentenced according to the laws of 1902, and that he was concerned about the absence of procedural fairness. He also announced that he would write to the British government to make his views known, which he did at the time. The matter now rests with the current Attorney-General, the member for Gellibrand, Nicola Roxon, for consideration and action. I am convinced that some form of redress is necessary in this matter and could provide the current generations with some relief after decades of controversy. The passing of time does not diminish any injustice. I urge members of this parliament to support the review undertaken by the former Attorney-General and urge the current Attorney-General to forward the evidence that substantiates calls to overturn the convictions and sentences of these men. Parramatta Electorate: Holroyd City Council Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (12:12): TodayI rise to talk about the great work being done by Holroyd City Council to tackle the problem of asbestos in my electorate. Australia suffers one of the highest rates of incidence of mesothelioma in the world with estimates of 13,000 cases by 2020 and a further 40,000 to 45,000 cases of asbestos related cancer. It is a dreadful disease. The survival rates for mesothelioma are extremely poor with only five per cent of patients still alive five years after diagnosis. We have known about the dangers of asbestos for a long time. As far back as in 1917 and 1918 several US studies showed that asbestos workers were dying unnaturally young. From 1916 Prudential Insurance in the US would not give life insurance to anybody who worked in an asbestos related industry, yet the material continued to be produced for decades. The issue of asbestos is a significant one in my electorate of Parramatta where James Hardie built its factories in the thirties. The factory remained open until 1982 and continued to sell its stockpile until 1987. Asbestos was used in the surrounding houses and also as landfill. The legacy is in our land, under our houses and our schools and in places that we are unaware of, as well as in the living bodies of many people who worked in the factories or shared a house with workers, and with the lost families and community members who succumbed to the fibres. Today most houses built prior to 1990 in Holroyd have asbestos used in their construction. Thankfully, Holroyd council is recognised as a national leader in tackling the issues surrounding asbestos, a recognition afforded to it by the Asbestos Diseases Foundation of Australia in 2010. The council have been instrumental in managing the high prevalence of asbestos in my community. For example, during Asbestos Awareness Week in November last year they launched a program to educate home owners, handymen and renovators about the dangers of asbestos. They have also been working with youth, together with students from Holroyd High School. Along with the Information and Cultural Exchange, Holroyd council last year developed the 'Ease the wheeze' educational video launched during Asbestos Awareness Week. It highlighted the health dangers of asbestos and used the students' creative song writing and filmmaking skills to sell the message. This kind of youth oriented medium is ideal for getting the message across to our youth. The young people of the area did a fine job in making that video; it really is very well done. I congratulate the Holroyd City Council for the work they are doing to educate the community about the dangers of this quite prevalent material in our electorate. They have done an extraordinary job, and I commend their work to the House. McPherson Electorate important community organisations in my electorate of McPherson on the Gold Coast: the Coolangatta Senior Citizens Centre and the Robina Lions Club. These two organisations do great work in different areas of the southern and central Gold Coast and their efforts certainly deserve recognition. Firstly, I would like to talk about the Coolangatta Senior Citizens Centre, of which I am the patron. The centre is located on the southern end of the Gold Coast and provides wonderful support and services to its 1,200 members as well as to other local seniors both from the southern Gold Coast and from northern New South Wales. Seniors make up a large section of the community on the southern Gold Coast. Through this centre a variety of activities for senior citizens are offered seven days a week, including: bingo, indoor bowls, line dancing and monthly bus trips and concerts. Importantly, the centre offers these activities at very affordable prices so seniors are able to participate in a wide range of activities without incurring a huge cost. On 20 January this year I was invited to attend the centre's January concert, and I was very pleased to accept that invitation. I took the opportunity during a short break in the concert to recognise the great work that the centre does by presenting them with a very special Australian flag that was flown in the House of Representatives chamber on 12 September 2011. I congratulate the president of the centre, Sue Wickham, the vice-president, Carmel Finn, and their team on the fantastic work that they do. I look forward to continuing to work with the Coolangatta Senior Citizens Centre. Secondly, I would like to acknowledge the Robina Lions Club. On 22 FebruaryI attended the judging of the Robina Lions Youth of the Year Quest, which was held at Bond University. Each of the six contestants, all of whom were women, were outstanding and should be very proud of their efforts. Each contestant was required to answer impromptu questions followed by a prepared speech, and I would like to acknowledge each of those contestants: Caitlin Gallagher, from Varsity College, who spoke about fear; Ayu Imoaka Asis, from Robina State",170,Constituency Statements
172,Mrs Andrews (Mcpherson) (12:15,"TodayI would like to speak about two veryHigh, whose speech was entitled 'Is beauty a beast?'; Sophie Tan, from Somerset College, who spoke about the Horn of Africa famine; Alynna Li-Vy Wong, from Robina State High, who gave a speech on 'Fear of the unfamiliar'; Janie-Marie Burgess, from Marymount College, who spoke on 'Gatecrashing and the juvenile criminal system'; and Madaline Hartwig, from St Michael's College, who spoke about 'Staying Australian'. Congratulations to the public speaking winner, Alynna, and the overall winner, Janie-Marie, who will go on to the next round of the competition on 3 March. Congratulations also to the president, Heather Veltmeyer, the chairman on the night, John McIntyre, and the Robina Lions for the wonderful community work that they do. I am very proud to work with these two groups and will continue to do so into the future. Australian Year of the Farmer Forestry) (12:18): Good afternoon, colleagues, on this very historic day. This is the first sitting of the Federation Chamber, and here we are, so we will be part of history again. I have spend the last three days with my minister, Joe Ludwig, and my colleagues the member for Lyons, Dick Adams, and the member for Bass, Geoff Lyons. We spent three days on the road celebrating the Australian Year of the Farmer. This is part of our ongoing commitment to honouring and celebrating agriculture in particular in Tassie. As you know, Tassie is a crucible for agriculture, forestry and fisheries in Australia. We visited sawmillers in Dunalley, we went to Tasmanian Gourmet Potatoes and we also went to Tas Alkaloids-a massive alkaloids processing facility that is the largest producer of thebaine in the world. We visited the headquarters of the Road Dam Irrigation Scheme in the north-east of Tassie. There are some really interesting prospects there, particularly the expansion of dairying, and also-interestingly enough, right in the middle of the countryside-aquaculture. It is fantastic what water can do. We also went to the innovative rhubarb producers, one of the largest in Australia, called Razz Rhubarb. We tried their rhu brew, which I recommend to everyone who wants particularly to clean your system out. Then we went to Bridestowe Estate lavender farm, the largest lavender farm in Australia, second only to the French and probably surpassing them now and the Japanese. I really recommend you go and visit, particularly if you like lavender cheese and lavender sausage, followed by lavender ice cream, which is probably still on my other coat. We also met with vegetable growers and processors in my village of Forth. We then went further into the beautiful north-west to Britton Timbers and Ta Ann processing facilities in Smithton, where we again reiterated the importance of the IGA process in Tasmania and our support for Ta Ann, a sustainable producer of value-added wood products. And we condemned again the outrageous behaviour of some of those environmental groups that are threatening their customers. We also met with the Van Diemen's Land Company, Hammond Farms, Greenham Beef and Tasmanian Dairy Products, who of course are part and parcel of this extraordinary expansion and explosion of dairying in north-west Tassie. We thank those people who hosted us so very well in this the Year of the Farmer.",172,Constituency Statements
173,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon,"Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries andMember for Throsby constituent of the member for Throsby, published in the Illawarra Mercury earlier this month. 'Stephen Jones needs to get his priorities straight,' he wrote. He went on to say: On August 23 I wrote a letter to all local state and federal MPs following BlueScope's announcement to downsize the Port Kembla steelworks by approximately 800 people. That very day I received a phone call from Joanna Gash. … She showed genuine interest in both my family's well-being and that of my fellow steelworkers. She asked if she could read my letter in Parliament in order to highlight the plight of the local area. She was true to her word and did so. I have since heard from Ryan Park, the state Labor member for Keira, but Anna Watson, Lee Evans, Sharon Bird and Stephen Jones have remained silent. Given the significant events impacting on local manufacturing industry and the subsequent job losses that have occurred and are occurring, I am perplexed at how the member for Throsby chooses to preoccupy himself at this time with the subject of gay marriage. I would have thought the preservation of jobs in Throsby would have riveted his interest. Especially intriguing in light of statements by his former leader committing Labor to the creation of an additional 500,000 jobs within three years. Confusing the issue even more is the admission in the Member's maiden speech that 'he comes to this parliament believing in the values that formed around the dinner table of a large Catholic family'. Given the Catholic Church's views on gay marriage, it was an extraordinary statement to make and then to repudiate by his stand. Mr Jones should be making headlines primarily by encouraging growth and employment in our region and providing tangible solutions to the problems faced in the Illawarra. Instead he has elected to push his own leftist ideologies at the expense of his obligations to the people who elected him. Mr Grogan's comments are not isolated. Even Throsby's own Labor Party branches are attacking him for not consulting or listening to his community. Stories of the member for Throsby ignoring inconvenient issues in his electorate come into my office on a surprisingly regular basis. The member is often quick to criticise me and I plead guilty to one of his charges. Yes, I do not support a carbon tax. Do you know why? Between the Throsby and Gilmore electorate since the member for Throsby was elected in 2010 thousands of workers who were formerly employed in the local manufacturing industry have lost their jobs. BlueScope Steel is the most prominent, and now I am hearing the possibility of further job losses at Kembla Grange, those at Bredero Shaw and APC Socotherm. That is a tip for the member for Throsby: put your ear to the ground, open your eyes and get your head out of the clouds. According to the Illawarra Business Chamber, key economic indicators show that Wollongong is losing ground when it comes to jobs growth and business attraction. But the leadership the member for Throsby offers does not extend beyond his socialist ideology. Mr Jones's inactivity in protecting jobs impacts on my constituents in Gilmore. He can do something about it but he is turning his back on the reality of events unfolding around him. He needs to show some initiative and coverage and not distract himself from the task at hand by pet projects.",173,Constituency Statements
174,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (12:21,"I share with the House the words of Michael Grogan, aCorio Electorate city has its stories-tales of triumphant and tragedy, enterprise and energy that tell us where we have come from and shape our sense of who we are. Geelong is no different. Our stories give us a sense of belonging to a community, to a town and to a region. The building blocks for many of our stories-the primary source, if you like-are held on our behalf in the Geelong Heritage Centre, a treasure trove of local history that sits within Geelong's city library. Here we find records detailing the lives of Geelong's earliest residents. There is the original marriage register from Geelong's Christ Church, the oldest church in Victoria still on its original site. This precious book, dated 1853, contains the names and signatures of some of the colony's earliest pioneers. There is also a more unusual public record, the Meredith dog register. Dating from 1864, when dog registration became law, it provides a fascinating glimpse into the lives of the region's early farmers. There is an impressive collection of drawings by renowned Geelong architects Buchan, Laird& Buchan. In it are plans for some of our most significant buildings from the Geelong art gallery, opened in 1915, to the city library, which opened in 1959. The heritage centre is also the custodian of a very precious set of more than 400 pressed ferns and licha pods gathered by one of the early curators of the Geelong Botanic Gardens, John Raddenberry. It is considered to be internationally significant. There are more than 100,000 photos, including a huge and growing collection of family photos donated by Geelong families over the past 30 years, and an almost complete set of the Geelong Advertiser-Victoria's oldest newspaper title and Australia's second oldest from its beginnings in 1840. There is a pair of 100-year-old Geelong Football Club socks as well as a scrapbook of sporting memorabilia dating from the 1890s and put together by Geelong West resident Louis Schweitzer. His vast collection of tickets, flyers and posters provides a marvellous step back in time. For those who remember with pleasure a visit to the old Bright and Hitchcock's department store, there is a wonderful collection of photos, clippings and memorabilia that spans the 120-year history of this much loved local business. Last year the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, Simon Crean, announced that $10 million from the first round of the Regional Development Australia Fund would help pay for the rebuilding of the library and heritage centre. And the rebuilding development comes just in time. With its leaking roof and lack of space, the heritage centre has been struggling to do what we need it to do to keep our records safe. But in celebration of this, it would be wonderful if the City of Greater Geelong put on display in the library some of those treasures of our past. And so today I call on the City of Greater Geelong to do just that. A new heritage centre will allow the public easier access to the collections so that generations to come will share our knowledge and add their own and hopefully feel the same belonging to this great city that we do. Swan Electorate: Hospitals electorate-its antenatal unit-with the Deputy Premier of Western Australia, Dr Kim Hames, who also happens to be the health minister.

176,Mr Irons (Swan) (12:27,"Last Wednesday I visited Bentley Hospital in myabout the hospital. Noting that fact, I think the health minister deserves to be quoted in this parliament as well. He said: There is no question that some degree of upgrade of that obstetric facility is needed, so we will be going through, getting a report done and working out what needs to be done. However, what is clear is that there is confusion around what is going to happen to that maternity service once Fiona Stanley Hospital opens. SoI will go through that again to make the intentions of this government very clear. Under the previous government, when Hon Jim McGinty was the minister, he made the decision that when Fiona Stanley Hospital was built, the Bentley Hospital obstetric service would close and those services would be provided by the new Fiona Stanley Hospital. In opposition, we had no reason whatsoever to doubt that that was good policy. We totally disagreed with what he was going to do with obstetric services at Osborne Park Hospital and campaigned to keep them, and he subsequently changed his mind and said he would keep those. However, we were in agreement about the potential closure of Bentley obstetric services. As we moved forward, we talked a lot to the local community, particularly to Steve Irons, as the local federal member and the local mayor, and there was strong support for continuing to retain that hospital in the future. The risk in that is that a report has been done by a prominent obstetrician that lists about 1 000 deliveries a year as the ideal size for an obstetric service, which is about what is done at Osborne Park Hospital. Currently at Bentley Hospital it is about 890, which is marginally under that level. However, it is expected that when Fiona Stanley Hospital opens, that service will not be required. The commitment that we gave, I think, a year or 18 months ago, which seems to be lost in the translation somewhere, is that we will now wait and see and reconsider once Fiona Stanley Hospital is open. So we will wait until early 2014 when Fiona Stanley Hospital opens. Given that there are only 20 obstetric beds that we have not changed from the Labor Party plan at that site and that Kaleeya is proposed to be closed as an obstetric service, we will wait and see what happens. People will vote with their feet. I have said that if they continue to support the Bentley obstetric service and if the number is getting close to the 1 000 that are needed, we will reconsider and reinvest whatever dollars are required to bring that up to a high-quality obstetric service. It is silly for us to go and spend millions of dollars there now, with only two years to that decision. However, in the meantime, we will do some work to freshen up the appearance of that obstetric unit and make sure that the people going there now-the nearly 900 of them who go there during a year for their deliverieshave a quality level of service. Once again, I want to make that public. Bentley obstetric service will not definitely close when Fiona Stanley obstetric service opens. 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded.

177,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke,"Order! In accordance with standing orderhas the same effect on performance as having a blood alcohol level of 0.05 per cent and, after 21 hours awake, people demonstrate the same deterioration as having a blood alcohol content of 0.1 per cent. Many people begin to show signs of mental fatigue later in the working day and tasks seem much more complicated, concentration wavers and mistakes can be made. Late nights spent working can cause mental fatigue, making it harder to recollect information and affecting the ability to think clearly. As representatives of the Australian people, our role is to make decisions on the passing of new laws and amendments or changes to existing laws, debate legislation and policy statements and make decisions on what we believe is right for our electorate and for our country. We make decisions on how we should be spending taxpayer's money whether we are in government or opposition. The quantity of information that can be processed by the human mind is limited. The mind tires and begins to ignore or forget information. How many of us have sat listening for hours at information being delivered, yet at the end cannot recall most of what has been said. In psychology, decision fatigue refers to the deteriorating quality of the decisions made by an individual, after a long session of decision making. It is now understood as one of the causes of irrational trade-offs in decision making. Decision fatigue can be caused by continual mental effort such as making decisions and brain overload where the brain cells have become exhausted. Although we do not feel physically tired, the more choices we have to make throughout the day, the more fatigued we become and the less likely we are to make hard decisions but go with the recommendations of others or no decision at all. In a recent article in the New York Times, John Tierney talks about decision fatigue, the newest discovery involving a phenomenon called ego depletion, a term coined by the social psychologist RoyF Baumeister: No matter how rational and high-minded you try to be, you can't make decision after decision without paying a biological price. It's different from ordinary physical fatigue-you're not consciously aware of being tired-but you're low on mental energy. The more choices you make throughout the day, the harder each one becomes for your brain, and eventually it looks for shortcuts, usually in either of two very different ways. One shortcut is to become reckless: to act impulsively instead of expending the energy to first think through the consequences. (Sure, tweet that photo! What could go wrong?) The other shortcut is the ultimate energy saver: do nothing. Instead of agonizing over decisions, avoid any choice. Ducking a decision often creates bigger problems in the long run, but for the moment, it eases the mental strain. You start to resist any change, any potentially risky move. Work schedules that require people to work for extended periods of time disrupt circadian or body clock rhythms and increase the risk of fatigue. A person suffering from fatigue may in turn experience difficulty in concentration, impaired recollection of timing and events or judgment, reduced capacity for effective interpersonal communication, reduced hand-eye coordination, reduced visual perception, reduced vigilance and slower reaction times. British researchers have found that, through a long-term study done on 10,000 civil servants, working more than 11 hours a day increases the risk of heart disease by 67 per cent compared to working a standard sevento eight-hour day. It was thought that working hours alongside other factors like blood pressure, diabetes, exercise and depression, could help doctors work out the risk of heart disease. Another recent study has also shown that people who work more than 11 hours a day are 2.4 times more likely to suffer depression. The British study found that working long hours may affect your mental health because of difficulties in unwinding after work and prolonged increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol. The less control one has over potentially stress inducing events and the more uncertainty they create, the more likely people are to feel stressed. Even the typical day-to-day demands of living can contribute to the body's stress response. The long-term activation of the stressresponse system and the subsequent overexposure to cortisol and other stress hormones can disrupt almost all of the body's processes. This results in an increased risk of numerous health problems, including heart disease, sleep problems, digestive problems, depression, obesity, memory impairment, worsening of skin conditions such as eczema, and it depletes the human immune system, increasing the risk of cancer and infectious disease. I appeal to my political colleagues from all parties to support this motion not only for their own health and well-being but for the health and well-being of the staff of this parliament, for whom we all have a shared responsibility. Thank you. Ms HALL (Shortland-Government Whip) (12:37): Firstly, I would like to acknowledge that this is first day that we have sat in this chamber now that it has been called the Federation Chamber. Secondly, and most importantly, I would like to acknowledge the fine work that has been done by Dr Mal Washer in trying to make the hours of this House more reasonable, rational and sane. His voice has been the one voice out there all the time arguing that human beings cannot function effectively without sleep. We work really long hours in this place. A member may get in at eight o'clock and leave at 11 o'clock. Not too many people in the community work those sorts of hours. As members of parliament, we are role models for the community. If we cannot have reasonable hours and demonstrate to the rest of the community that reasonable hours are the way to go, how can we expect reasonable hours to be the norm for the community as a whole? I am not sure that the wording and the points in the motion are exactly the way I would like to go, but the sentiments that have been expressed are the ones that should be adopted by this emphasise 'Dr' Washer-is a man of science, a man who has researched this issue fully. When he puts to the parliament the impact the lack of sleep has on an individual and he recites his sources and the research that has taken place, it demonstrates that this is a fact. In a former life, I actually worked with people as a rehabilitation councillor. I worked with people who were injured at work. One of the factors that often caused injury at work was the fact that the person had worked very long hours, was over tired and had made that mistake. A mistake in some environments can cause serious injury or loss of life. In our work environment, I think that poor decision making can impact on a lot of people's lives, not just on the lives of people in this parliament but also on the lives of the Australian public as a whole. It is an obligation of our office to ensure that we consider legislation and issues before the parliament in a rational, sound way. The research that I have read also demonstrates the impact that these long hours have on individuals. It is well known that people who do shift work and rotating shift work have severe problems with sleep, and that also tends to manifest itself with physical and mental disabilities. There has been a lot of research done in the area of rotating shift work and the underlying effect of people not having standard sleep patterns. They are not able to work, rest,",176,Private Members Business
178,Parliament. We Need To Introduce Some Rational Hours Into This Place. Dr Washer,"and Irecover and then come to work the next day and make sound, rational decisions. You need to be able to have a balance in your life. As I mentioned, the impact of sleep deprivation is well researched. Dr Washer quoted research that indicates that 17 hours without sleep equates to 0.65 alcohol content in your blood. My daughter-in-law works as a nurse at one of the hospitals in the Hunter. She does night shifts all the time. Sometimes, her husband has to go and pick her up because she does not feel that she can safely drive home from work. She is unable to drive her children to school and to day care after she has worked a night shift. It really does impact on a person's life and impacts in a number of ways. It does lead to long-term psychological problems. It is well researched that constant lack of sleep leads to depression and other forms of mental illness and anxiety. People are much more likely to have a stress response to a situation. In this parliament, we work in a very combative environment and late at night I have noticed that people tend to have a much shorter fuse. Communications is a vital part of our job in this parliament. If you are tired, if you lack sleep and if you are stressed then you are not going to be able to communicate effectively. Dr Washer made the point about sleep disorders and the impact of the lack of sleep on a person's life is very well documented in all the research. The other issue I would like to touch on is one that not only affects us, as members of parliament, but also affects the staff of each and every one of us. I know that when my staff have been here into the early hours of the morning and hop into a car to drive home they are quite concerned about their safety as they drive home. I can remember a six o'clock or seven o'clock morning here, and I would not have trusted myself behind the wheel of a car. Isn't it an obligation on us, as members of parliament, to ensure the safety not only of our staff but of all those staff who work here in Parliament House-the people who look after us in the chamber, the people who come here early in the morning and then maybe go home the next day at 10 o'clock. There are rules in place about how long a person must have off before they can return to the workplace. You cannot do an overtime shift in which you work from nine to five, then do overtime and then turn up the next day. There are laws that regulate the amount of time you need to have off work. In this parliament we do not look at the impact that continuous sittings and work have on all those involved in this place. I know that Dr Washer has had a long-term concern about this issue. He has highlighted the psychological impacts, the physical impacts and the short-term and long-term physical impacts of sleep deprivation.

It is not only your daughter who is working that night shift but also paramedics of Australia and policemen, people who work in the water industry, truck drivers and others in transport working late at night, child protection workers, firemen, and the list goes on. These people all contribute out of hours to this nation. That is not what we are here for. I will give you some background. There are two people in this room who have been here since 1990: the member for Banks, Mr Melham, and me, the member for McMillan. From 1990 we have been through many nights where the parliament sat through the early hours of the morning and into the very, very early hours of the morning.",178,Private Members Business
179,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (12:47,"Firstly, let me acknowledge the work of theWe thought that with this new parliament those days were gone-finished, history, it will not happen again-but we had an occasion a few months ago where we filibustered into the night, and that is all you could call it. On a very serious issue in this parliament we filibustered into the night and it was totally unnecessary. But with this parliament as it stands, as a hung parliament, you cannot give leave to your team to go home while the small team bats on. We are all here, we are all in it, and a vote can be held at any time, called by one side or the other, so we have an obligation to be standing in this House on behalf of the constituents who elected us. We accept that. So, why can't we come to a resolution whereby the parliament, in good common sense, comes forward as we have here? Why didn't it go through the Procedure Committee, or to the whips, or to the leadership or to the Prime Minister to get this outcome? The reason is that it would not have happened, because people have vested interests and they do not want to take away the opportunity to take account of what is happening on the other side at any given time and call a vote. That leaves us with only one option now, as Dr Washer very expertly put it. If you want a technical reason for what we are doing, read Dr Washer's speech. If you want a reason for what we are doing-out of common sense and because of the real world we live in-listen to what I am saying. The members of this House do not perform well after 11 o'clock. I have been here since 1990 and I have never seen backbenchers or frontbenchers performing well at all after 11 o'clock at night. In fact, on occasion-and I am looking at you all at the moment-some of your performances have been atrocious after 11 o'clock at night. That was the inspiration for this bill: that this parliament should not be looking at very serious legislation that is before this House and that impacts on every person in our community, often the children and the generations ahead, at that time of night. I say that having heard the evidence put forward by Dr Washer and having listened to the concerns of reasonable members of parliament in this place. I know the general public will say: 'What are they complaining about? They have it easy.' I spoke to a woman this morning who said: 'I have had two lives, Mr Broadbent. I have had a life in the Public Service, where I was getting ministerial briefs up to people like yourself all the time.' I said, 'That would have been hard work.' And she said: 'It was hard work, and intense sometimes. But I've got this other life now, where I'm actually watching, very close hand, what politicians do. I have a changed opinion of you as a group.' I said, 'Thank you very much.' It is not known, other than by those closest to us-our staff, our family and the other occupants of this building-what politicians actually do, the work they do on the behalf of their constituents and the time that can often take. That is extremely important. So is the business of government. I want to make the business of government so important that we knock off at a reasonable time and come in the next day with a greater opportunity to do the best on behalf of this nation that we can possibly do as individuals. Honourable members: Hear, hear! electorate. It is an area where I have lived all my life. I was born there. My family has lived there for generations. Just over 1,000 people have been elected to the House of Representatives since this country came into existence. My observation in the four years I have been here is that politicians of all persuasions and political parties work hard in their electorates. They are not working from 9 am to 5 pm; they work six and often seven days a",179,Private Members Business
180,Mr Neumann (Blair) (12:52,"It is a great honour and privilege to represent myweek. Those of us who campaign regularly know that it is required in a marginal seat. Our staffs work very, very hard. Sometimes I think there is a special place in heaven for our staff. They work just as hard as we do when we are here in Canberra; you can see that: staff leaving at the same time as politicians at the end of a long session. And what about the attendants? What about Hansard, and the other staff here? They have to work those hours as well. Thousands of people work in this building. It is not just the 150 in the House of Representatives and the 76 in the Senate but all those other people as well, all the ministerial staff and the public servants. SoI think we have to have some degree of reasonableness and common sense about the hours we work. My first job in life was as a cleaner in the meat works. I worked a night shift. When the foreman asked me to work other than during university holidays, for example, when I was a full-time student at law school at the University of Queensland, I found it extremely difficult and could barely do it. SoI used to restrict my work hours in the meat works to university holidays. Let us get realistic. It is not as if we actually start work at the hour prescribed in the standing orders. I get picked up at 6 am and I go for a run and go to the gym. I see many politicians in there getting those few hours of exercise-it is for their mental health, as well as their physical health. I see the member for Ryan here. She and I have had the privilege of making more speeches than any other Queenslanders in the House of Representatives, but it takes time to do that when you are down here. You do your constituency work as well and there are endless meetings. For example, I am more tired after Monday than I am on any other day during the session. I am pretty fit. I run regularly and I lift weights. There are a lot of people in this place who do the same. But I know on Tuesday that I am extremely tired because, generally, we have made lots of speeches and it takes work. We do lots of representations made to ministers. If you cannot do your work properly, you cannot serve well the people you are elected to represent. I have heard speeches from those opposite and I have heard our speeches in the wee hours in the morning. Some of those speeches are not their finest hour. But it is not just the speeches; it is the decisions that they make. I think the long hours currently in our standing orders and the fact that we seem to more often honour them more in the breach than in the observance, result in the fact that there is more irritability and erasability amongst politicians on both sides. We agree on about 80 or 90 per cent of the legislation that goes through. We disagree violently on lots of issues. I think we are always right and they are always wrong, but they think exactly the opposite. That is what it is in a democracy. Let us be an example and let us show compassion and understanding. If we believe in good workplace health and safety not for just ourselves but for the staff of the parliament, the public service, the ministerial advisors and our staff as well, let us think about good industrial practices in this place. On our side of politics, we pride ourselves on a simple, fair and flexible workplace arrangements. We might disagree on a few issues on the other side such as industrial relations but I think in their of hearts that they know their employees should also be cared for. Most small businesses are family business, but most big businesses have human relationship advisors as well because it is important. This place needs to have a bit more emphasis on mental health, not just for the politicians, but for the staff who work with us as well. It is important that we be physically fit and also be mentally fit. The Prime Minister and the cabinet make decisions which affect people's lives every day as do backbenchers. I applaud the member for Moore and thank him for the way he has looked after me at various stages when I have been ill in this place. easier by any stretch of the imagination, but to make them more effective. My understanding-and I am sure the member for McMillan and the member for Banks can tell me-is that, when this Federation Chamber we are in today under its current name was created, the purpose was so that we could get through more work in reasonable hours. I am sure that was the purpose of facilitating the Federation Chamber. It was acknowledging that we had a big workload, acknowledging that we had many bills and many motions to get through but also acknowledging the fact that, once you get late into the evening, you are past being able to perform appropriately and effectively. That is why we have the second chamber. I have to admit that, while I have been in this parliament, I think there has been only one or maybe two occasions that we have actually met after 11 o'clock. I would also suggest that no politician is saying that their life is not 24/7 on call. At all levels of government, as members, we are there when needed for our constituents, probably local government more so than any other level, where we are able to respond. What we have today in the form of a motion from the member for Moore, Dr Washer, is the fact that we do not perform well when we have had long days. Just as we exhort drivers to stop and revive, this is what we are saying. We are not performing at our best if we are working long hours. In particular, I wanted to speak today in agreement with the member for Blair about the support staff. It is not about us. I remember working long hours in small business. Who has not worked through the night getting the BAS statement done? Who has not worked through the night getting that tender in? Often, when you check it the next day, you have missed some obvious points because you have been tired. But here in this chamber and this House are the staff. As the member for Blair said, it is not just a handful of staff, our personal staff, but literally hundreds of staff who are here for as long as we are. Those staff have to turn up again the next day. Those staff have families. Those staff have homes that they need to go to, and they do not sign on to work the long hours that we do. We know some of the pressures we are under but the staff who work in this wonderful parliament, who make things go smoothly for us, also have pressures. Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, we can look here to the clerks who assist you with your speaking responsibilities and their officers and also those of the whips. We can also look to the drivers. We talk about being so tired that we do not want to drive ourselves home but we have drivers who are in the Comcars to take us home so that we can front up the next day. We have security staff who work around the clock for us, and of course the Hansard staff who have to be here for as long as we keep speaking or putting motions. In fact, there are a whole range of people who are here supporting this parliament whom we need to be mindful of. And isn't that what the job of politicians is about? It is about thinking of other people and the effect of our decisions on them. That is why I very strongly support this motion. We talk about our role in speaking in the chamber and participating in the votes, but in this great electronic age we also have hundreds of emails sent to us. When we come down to Canberra we cannot stop doing our work. As the member for Blair said, we have speeches to",180,Private Members Business
181,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (12:57,"I also rise to support this motion, not to make our liveswrite and committees to work on but we also have our constituency work, and that must continue as well. As Dr Washer pointed out, if we are going to cope with all of our various roles we do need to draw a line in the sand at some time during the day. I believe we should lead by example. Indeed, the member for Melbourne, I note, in an inquiry into work-life balance, talks about the need for flexibility. SoI think everyone in this parliament is probably in agreement that we are not at our best after 11 o'clock at night and so, in the interest of making good decisions and in the interest of supporting the very hard working staff in this parliament, I urge everyone to support this motion. for 22 years, having been elected with the member for McMillan at the 1990 election. In that time. I have served on and off on the Procedures Committee. I was actually a member of the Procedures Committee when Neal Blewett was the then chairman and brought down the report that led to the creation of this chamber, which has subsequently been picked up by the House of Commons. As the member for Ryan has alluded to, this chamber was brought about to make us more efficient and more productive. Non-contentious legislation was to be referred to it, and so it was a better way of managing the affairs of the parliament. The trade-off was better working hours. At that stage we were successful. I led the charge within the government party room for better working hours in terms of the legislative program. We succeeded in having parliament in the main finish at 8 pm of an evening. Of course, on the last sitting weeks of each session or at Christmas we knew that we would sit longer. Sadly, that structure was abandoned on the election of the Howard government. The then Prime Minister John Howard and Ian Sinclair-there is no dispute about this; it was well intentioned-preferred the older hours. I think that was a mistake. The current sitting practice is a mistake, and I said so at an informal gathering of members of parliament of all political persuasions before the last Procedures Committee report-it has not, as I understand it, been picked up. The current sitting practice is bad for health. I agree with everything that the honourable member for Moore has said in relation to health, amongst other things. I know why he is adopting the minimalist approach but I do not support the motion because it takes a minimalist approach. I am only speaking for my actions here. I think there should be a complete overhaul. It does not mean less work for members of the parliament. It means better conditions for staff and members of the parliament. It means better productivity. I think all the private members' business that we have as backbenchers is a mistake. We do not need an hour's adjournment every day of a parliamentary sitting. The whips on both sides have to get people out to do the adjournment speeches. There are other ways that we can offset some of this so that government business time is not lost. I am someone who has always championed private members' business and private members' opportunities, but do not mistake an hour of adjournment debate on a night as quality debate or as providing quality speeches by members of the parliament. When I was shadow minister I was here at five o'clock in the morning and, during the native title debate I was here late at night, night after night, and at seven o'clock in the morning making speeches. We are walking around this place like zombies. That does not serve the parliament well. I think it is high time that the executive, the opposition executive and the backbenchers sit down and have a rational discussion in relation to our hours.",182,Private Members Business
182,Mr Melham (Banks) (13:01,"On 24 March next month I will have served in this placeThe problem with this particular motion is that an automatic adjournment can create problems for the government of the day. To me the automatic adjournment should be at 7.30 or eight o'clock of an evening, not 11 o'clock, and there should still be that flexibility where, if the government needs to go a little bit further, it should. It is not about working fewer hours. I was a legal aid solicitor and barrister before I came into this place. On one occasion I had 24 briefs to appear in front of the court on sentences and a mention. I did three trials in three days, three trials in four days. I coped well. In terms of making speeches I was more tired as a shadow minister and sometimes when I was a more active backbencher because of our sitting hours than when I was actually representing people whose liberty depended on my advocacy. Why? Because of the way we have structured our hours. Our hours are Monday to Thursday, then we leave and go home to our electorates where we have different hours. Then we come back, again, to different hours from the weekend hours, to a variation in relation to the way we conduct our business. Then we have two weeks off, when we are in our electorates and we are at functions late at night. I oppose the honourable member's motion because I do not think the motion goes far enough. This is my personal view; it is not the party's view. I do not think it is productive. I do not think it is good for business. I think that we have made sacrifices in this second chamber. It has worked well. There will be occasions where we need to sit beyond eight o'clock, which everyone can live with. But this automatic 11 o'clock at night adjournment is a joke. It is insane; it is madness. No-one else would cop it. We should not cop it. Debate adjourned. Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. Mr Lyons: I second the motion pro forma. Marriage Amendment Bill 2012, a bill for an act to amend the Marriage Act 1961 to establish marriage equality for same-sex couples and for related purposes. The bill is short and to the point. Its focus is on making an amendment to the definition of marriage that is now set out in section 5 of the Marriage Act 1961. The provisions of this bill Item1 of schedule 1 of the bill will amend the definition of marriage that is currently in section 5 of the Marriage Act to read: Marriage means the union of two people, regardless of their sex, to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. The bill also amends section 46(1) of the Marriage Act to reflect this new definition of marriage.",183,Private Members Business
183,Mr Stephen Jones (Throsby) (13:07,I move:,184,Bills
184,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke,Is the motion seconded?,184,Bills
185,Mr Stephen Jones,"TodayI am pleased to provide the second reading of theFreedom of religion In Australia, the separation of church and state extends to the law of marriage. Our laws of marriage primarily exist to regulate a legal contract in which the parties to marriage enter into this contract willingly. They are both free to enter into this contract and they comply with the laws regarding marriage so that this civil arrangement is legally valid. Our laws also recognise and respect the role of religious organisations to practise their faith, including their practices concerning marriage. Because Australia's proud tradition of religious freedom is such a fundamental tenet we subscribe to, the bill before the House today inserts a new subsection into section 47 of the act, to reinforce the existing provisions that ensure a minister of religion is under no obligation to solemnise a marriage where the parties to that marriage are of the same sex. This provision will absolutely ensure that the principle of religious freedom is maintained when it comes to the laws of marriage in Australia. This Marriage Act became Commonwealth law after Sir Garfield Barwick introduced the bill into this parliament in 1960 to provide for uniform marriage laws across Australia. In his second reading speech, Sir Garfield made the following observation: …it will be observed that there is no attempt to define marriage in this bill. None of the marriage laws to which I have referred contains any such definition. But insistence of its monogamous quality is indicated by…the provisions of the Matrimonial Causes Act which render a marriage void where one of the parties is already married and by a provision in this bill making bigamy an offence. As many of those in this place would well know, the definition of marriage in the Commonwealth Marriage Act is a relatively recent inclusion. Indeed, it was not until the Marriage Legislation Amendment Act 2004, introduced in this place by the then Attorney-General and current member for Berowra, that the Marriage Act included the current definition. In his second reading speech to the bill, the then Attorney set out the following reasons for inclusion of a definition of marriage: Including this definition will remove any lingering concerns that people may have that the legal definition of marriage may become eroded by time. Far from representing an erosion, this bill extends the right of marriage to same-sex couples. Far from eroding it, it recognises that marriage equality is now something that the majority of Australians are comfortable with and accept. While marriage is an old institution, it is not immutable. Practices and understanding of marriage have changed in accordance with societal norms and they will continue to do so. I believe this is reflected in the fact that the Commonwealth laws with regard to marriage have been amended by every single government in this place since their inception. Why this bill? At the end of 2011 the Australian Labor Party voted to change its policy to allow for equal access to marriage for all adult couples, irrespective of sex, who have a mutual commitment to a shared life. The ALP also voted to allow a conscience vote on any legislation due to give effect to this. The bill that I bring before the House today reflects that change in policy. Conclusion The aim of this bill is to end discrimination against same-sex couples who wish to have their relationship recognised by the state. In practical terms it will give same-sex couples the same rights and obligations in their marriage as I have in mine. It also sends a powerful message that our belief in equality and a fair go is not limited by a person's sexuality. I commend the bill to the House. Lobby and for the benefit of people of faith right across this country, just before the 2009 election, the Prime Minister made this statement: We have determined, as a Labor Party, that the Marriage Act will stay unchanged so marriage will be defined as it is in our current Marriage Act, as between a man and a woman, and we have also said that the Labor Party policy is we do not want to see the development of ceremonies that mimic marriage ceremonies and so that's the party policy and as Prime Minister, as leader of the parliamentary Labor Party, that's obviously my policy and that's what you should expect to see from the Gillard Labor government if we're re-elected. That is a pretty clear, explicit and unequivocal statement from the Prime Minister, from the leader of the Labor Party. To press the point, in the context of this interview, the interviewer-the Australian Christian Lobby's Managing Director, Brigadier Jim Wallacewent on to ask the Prime Minister: CanI just say that obviously one of the concerns of the constituency here is the knowledge that this was only, it seemed, upheld by direct intervention of the highest levels of the party at the last Labor conference. So you're saying that a Gillard Labor government will keep that policy in place? To which the Prime Minister replied, 'Absolutely'. Then she went on to say: I was personally and directly involved in this policy and its development at the last national conference. So it is very clear that at the 2009 election the Australian Labor Party made a solemn commitment to the electorate to support the legal definition of 'marriage'-that definition, as it is in the current Act, being as between one man and one woman. The Prime Minister famously made another promise less than a week before election day 2010 when she said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' And just like we saw that promise broken last year, this month we have seen another promise broken with the introduction of the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 by the Labor member for Throsby after Labor changed its policy at the national conference. And just like the broken carbon tax promise, this broken promise has come at the pushing of my good friend the member for Melbourne and also the Greens. It just shows, after the events of this morning, that in the Labor Party absolutely nothing has changed. We still have a minority government that does not know where it is going and that is completely driven and led by the nose by Senator Bob Brown and his Green colleagues.",184,Bills
186,Mr Christensen (Dawson) (13:13,"In a video recorded for the Australian ChristianInstead of hearing excuses as to why this change happened and hearing lines from the Prime Minister like 'I still support marriage as it is currently defined', the question needs to be asked as to why the Labor Party has gone awry on this issue. That is a decision the Labor Party has made. It obviously has the support of their rank and file and I assume the parliamentary party as well, or at least the majority of members. For the people who sit in churches every Sunday, who cast their vote for the Labor Party on the basis of the Prime Minister's statement, let me read that again: We have determined as a Labor Party the Marriage Act will stay unchanged, so marriage will be defined as it is in our current Marriage Act as between a man and a woman. I read that for those people who cast their vote for the Labor Party on the basis of this issuethis sacrosanct issue for them-not being changed, for the definition of marriage to be retained. What those people should hear from this government and from this Prime Minister is: 'Sorry. Sorry that we once again have duped you. Sorry that we said one thing before the election and now are doing a very, very different thing afterwards.' But the proposal by the Labor Party to change the legal definition of marriage is not just wrong on the grounds that it is a broken promise. It also flies in the face of Australia's international obligations, because same-sex marriage lends itself to more children being raised without both their biological mother and biological father as their parental figures. Every child deserves a mother and a father. Article7 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states: The child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents. Every child deserves a mother and a father. You know why? Because it works. A 2010 Australian Institute of Family Studies report entitled Families then and now: 1980-2010 showed that 72 per cent-almost three-quarters-of Australian families with children under the age of 18 years are intact biological families. That is about 2.1 million families in this country. We only need to look at other examples of where children have been robbed of this right to be raised by their mother and father, by their natural parents, to see what trauma it has caused them. When we look at the Aboriginal Australians who were removed from their parents, possibly with the best of intentions of the governments involved at the time, we can see the deep and lasting psychological scars that many Indigenous people still have to this day brought about by their removal through government policy. Last year's Senate inquiry into the donor conception system in this nation exposed the angst felt by many persons. One such person speaking publicly on this issue said: I was always really proud of being donor createdfrom time to time we do hear children of same-sex families say they are proudbut, once I had kids of my own, I realised what I had been deprived of. I have a fantastic relationship with my parents … but things are missing; things that couldn't be provided-identity, heritage, history. When I look in the mirror, I don't know who that person is. When I read those words from someone who has been robbed of the right to a mother and father I wonder to myself if we can honestly be sure that as result of this bill we will not be hearing from children of same-sex marriages in the future saying that they have been deprived of a mother or a father and talking about being robbed of their identity, their heritage, their history and their right to a mother and father. Marriage is all about family-it is all about children; it is all about creating a legal union between a man and a woman, providing permanence in their relationship and establishing a legal bond between those two people and their children. Yes, it is for the benefit of parents but more so for the benefit of children and, as a result, the benefit of society. The only way society can continue is through children. The only reason government is involved in the regulation of relationships through the Marriage Act is because procreation is the only way society can go on. If it were not for that fact, the government would not be playing in this field at all. This is a very important issue that has been neglected in this whole debate. The Labor Party need to come back to the Australian people with what they promised them before the 2010 election. That promise was that the policy would be retained-the Greens can have their policy, but the Labor Party policyspeaking to a private member's billseriousness of that as an issue. Party and at the last election(Time expired) towards marriage equality. Parliament now has before it three bills that, if enacted, would remove discrimination from the Marriage Act, and across the country support for equal love is now deeply felt and widespread. There is a sense of inevitability about the change comingthat love will, eventually, prevail. In fact, the Prime Minister is reported to have acknowledged this inevitability at a recent dinner at the Lodge with same-sex couples. Yet the path to marriage equality is still blocked-blocked by a Prime Minister frightened of more division in her party; blocked by an opposition leader unwilling to let go of the past; and blocked by a lack of courage amongst many in this place who know what is right but as yet are unwilling to stand by their convictions. As I have said, this is a pivotal moment but also a moment of great danger to those who seek to make marriage equal. There is a real danger that if we act too quickly and move too fast on progressing these bills, we will lose the best opportunity we have of bringing about lasting change. That is why the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill, cosponsored by the member for Denison and me, will be examined by the House and Senate inquiry before we move to a vote. That is why I have sought to work with other members in this place to put in place a single bill to end discrimination. I hope that the committee process can identify which elements of the three bills are the best and that we use the next few months to bring together a single bill. There are some differences between this bill and the Greens' Marriage Equality Amendment Bill-for example, the manner in which the bills deal with religious protections and the extent to which consequential change to related legislation can be made. These are small but significant differences that should be examined.",186,Bills

191,Mr Bandt (Melbourne) (13:23,"We have reached a pivotal moment in our journeyI say to the mover of this bill, the member for Throsby, and others in Labor, that there is nothing to be gained by pressing forward with this bill at this time and everything to lose. Labor forfeited the right to treat this issue as a government reform when it moved to a conscience vote, so this is a private member's bill. As we have seen time and time again in this place, the best chance we have of getting such a bill through this place is one that is cosponsored across the parties. SoI urge those in Labor who want to see marriage equality to slow down, take a deep breath and work with members across the parties to get this through. The reality is that we do not yet have the numbers in place to pass these bills-neither my bill, nor the member for Throsby's bill nor Senator Hanson-Young's bill. That is the fact of the matter. We do not have the numbers yet to pass these bills because the old parties are not yet willing to support full equality. Yes, Labor changed its platform; but it squibbed on real reform by allowing a conscience vote. At the moment, this has left the fate of marriage equality in the hands of the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, who has bound his cabinet against change and, as a result, has tied the hands of most of the Liberal members in this place. This is despite the Liberal Party's claim to support individual liberty and freedom. So we are in a dangerous situation, potentially, where a step forward too fast will mean that the last several years of campaigning could come to nought. There is no doubt that many in the old parties would like the push for marriage equality to fail. We know that there are those who would like to push this bill to a failed vote and then, perhaps, to blame Tony Abbott. There are others who have stated publicly that they would rather that parliament discuss a proposal for civil unions that would entrench two tiers of citizenship in this country. Without taking anything away from those who have chosen to participate in the civil unions just legislated in Queensland, we know that civil unions are not full equality. So there are potentially other agendas here. There are many in the old parties who want to get marriage equality off the agenda and they want to move forward to a losing vote on these bills. I want to make it absolutely clear that the Australian Greens will not be part of any such agenda. Every last member of our team supports marriage equality. We have been fighting for full equality for years and we are not going to give up now. SoI call on the member for Throsby and those on the government side who support marriage equality to hold off on a vote on this bill. Regardless of today's debate, we should not rush headlong to a vote that we will lose. The process that I have just outlined is what those who wish to marry would want, and that is the clear message from equal marriage advocates. Let us take time to build more support. This reform will surely fail if any one party tries to own it. In order to get this reform through we have to be prepared to share the love. The march to freedom and equality has never been easy. It is a road that takes many twists and turns. It must forde many streams and climb many obstacles. I believe that freedom's march can never be denied, because it is powered by one of the most powerful and fundamental of human values-that is, the power of love. It is the love of others and love of those close to you. It is the love of humanity and the love of one's neighbours and friends. It is the love of one's children and the love of one's partner. This is the persistent motivation that has driven history's struggles for freedom and it continues to be today. Regardless of attempts to deny it, this love will not be denied. In one of his most famous passages, from Corinthians, St Paul said: Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. SoI believe that, with love's perseverance, we will one day soon remove the barriers to equal love. But if marriage equality is to be achieved it will need love's patience as well. I want to thank the member for Throsby for his commitment to marriage equality and I say again: let us work together to get this done. On that basis and with those reservations I commend this bill to the House, I commend my and the member for Denison's bill to the House and I commend Senator Sarah Hansen-Young's bill for consideration. It is my fervent hope that, after the committees have inquired into these bills and reported on them, we will be able to move forward in a unified position joined, which is my greatest hope, by someone from the coalition benches who believes what they say when they say that an individual should have the right to do as they choose provided that it does not harm someone else. Debate adjourned. Sitting suspended from 13:31 to 16:00 Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012 Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012 Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. to which the following amendment was moved: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House is of the view that, in light of global economic uncertainty and existing pressures on Australian industry and jobs, the Government should not appropriate funds for measures associated with the introduction of a carbon tax to allow for the postponement of introduction of the tax until after elections have been held for the 44th Parliament and the Parliament has met."" nationally and in my electorate of Dawson. Contrary to what this government would have us believe, people are doing it tough. The Prime Minister and Treasurer have been eager to spruik the economy and to say that everything is so much better than it is in Greece, but they have failed to mention how this government has emptied the country's bank account and racked up the biggest debt we have ever seen. The problem with this drunken-sailor approach to running the economy is that it only works for so long-the money runs out, so the drunken sailor borrows more and more. Eventually the government will reach a point where it cannot keep borrowing money and will have to start paying it back. While this government points the finger at other economies around the world which are in dire straits because they spent beyond their means, the fundamentals that drive the economy long-term are getting out of control. People are hurting, and, with a drunken sailor at the wheelhouse, things are only going to get worse. People are scared of the carbon tax for a reason. They call it a fear campaign, but it is simply a matter of",188,Bills
192,Mr Christensen (Dawson) (16:01,"I rise to highlight issues of significance bothtelling the truth-and the truth is that people should be scared. Electricity will cost more under the carbon tax. Rates will cost more under the carbon tax. Food will cost more under the carbon tax. The truth is that everything will cost more under the carbon tax, even when families are already struggling. Businesses are also struggling. Here are some examples of how much more businesses will pay just for electricity under the carbon tax. Bushman's Bread in Mackay will see an increase of between $18,000 and $24,000 in its electricity prices under the carbon tax. Harrup Park Country Club will see an increase of between $39,600 and $52,800 in its electricity prices under the carbon tax. G&S Engineering will see an increase of between $63,000 and $84,000 in its electricity prices under the carbon tax-so we will be looking at an additional cost of $84,000 to that business for electricity because of the carbon tax. How does a small business or a growing business offset a cost such as that? Businesses in my electorate have already told me that they are going to have to look at cutting back on staff. The Prime Minister said last year about the carbon tax, 'It has price impacts. It's meant to. That's the whole point. If you put a price on something, then people will use less of it.' So another alternative for businesses would be to operate according to the reasoning of the Prime Minister, the Labor Party, the Greens and the collection of Independents, all of whom think that an increase in the cost of electricity for Bushman's Bread in Mackay will mean that the company will cut back and only bake half a loaf of bread or half bake a loaf of bread-one of the two. The problem is that this tax is a half-baked plan from a half-baked government that is half confident in its own leader. They do not even have a mandate for the carbon tax. Business owners did not give them the mandate; neither did the families they employ, who are already struggling. Families living in Mackay are bearing the brunt of the resources boom. It is a boom for some, but not everyone is working in the mines. The increased demand in the city has driven up prices as businesses compete for resources, especially labour, and people compete for housing. If you are not employed in the resources sector but are stuck renting an average home for $500 a week or more, you are going to be struggling. If you were not in the resources sector in nearby Moranbah, where rents range from $1,400 to $3,200 a week, you were squeezed out of town a long time ago. In the nearby Whitsundays there is one industry, tourism. How can a family not be struggling in this region when they have suffered several cyclones, including a direct hit, and had the tourism destination's image trashed by the media, creating the impression that all of Queensland was at one stage flooded out? To top things off, a tourist destination relying on international visitors will always struggle to come out of the global financial crisis when the skyrocketing Australian dollar is deterring overseas visitors and driving domestic tourism offshore. Tourism is an exporter and a price taker. If Australian tourist destinations cannot compete with overseas destinations then Australian tourism just does not do business. So why on earth would this government introduce a carbon tax which Australian companies in tourism, including airlines and marine operators, will have to pay but which their overseas competitors will not have to pay? That is driving business out of the country and locking the door behind them. The same applies to the northern parts of my electorate, where the entire economy of the Burdekin is underpinned by the sugar industry. It is our second biggest market in Mackay. Sugar is another export market, another price taker. This is another industry that will have to pay the costs of this ridiculous carbon tax and will not be able to pass on those costs to their overseas customers. Canegrowers, the peak body, estimates that the carbon tax will cost farmers more than $80 million in its first five years. So, if people are hurting now, worse is to come. This government made a big deal at budget time last year of the fact that the budget was all about jobs, jobs, jobs. With deference to the tourism industry, where the bloody hell are they? For the first time in 20 years Australia recorded zero jobs growth, and that is with a government focusing on jobs creation and before the carbon tax has even started. What will the carbon tax contribute to jobs growth? It will not boost jobs, that is for sure. Where are the green jobs going to come from? Nowhere-but we can see where the jobs will go. You cannot push business offshore, you cannot push industry offshore, you cannot push manufacturing offshore without pushing the jobs offshore as well. People in Mackay locked into big mortgages cannot afford to be unemployed. In the Whitsundays, the remaining businesses cannot afford to operate if the community sees further job losses. In the Burdekin, job losses would kill the town and destroy our nation's food production capacity. In Townsville, in suburbs like Wulguru and Oonoonba, we have battlers already struggling to make ends meet. How do they feel when they see the government imposing a carbon tax and on the other hand wasting taxpayer dollars? What do they feel when they read about this government delivering set-top boxes for $698 when they know they can walk down to the local retailer and get one for $19 off the shelf? It is no wonder these people feel that they are the forgotten families. They have had enough of the drunken sailor approach. They have had enough of this government pandering to a handful of minority interest groups in the capital cities. I am very fortunate to be in an electorate that is driving the economy of this nation. My constituents are proud of what they are contributing. The wealth of the country is produced by hard work and long hours put in by people in regional Australia. It is the wealth that is keeping the nation afloat. What they are not proud of is the disdain with which they are treated by this government. They work hard, they pay high taxes, they pay the high cost of living and the high cost of housing, and this government rewards them by taxing them more. They put the world's biggest carbon tax on everything and give these hard workers nothing in return. There is no compensation for people working in the resource industry, regardless of how hard they work or the fact that their real disposable income is often lower than that of capital city families who receive compensation. They want the government to stop wasting the wealth that regional Australia generates and to start investing in the regional infrastructure required for sustained wealth generation. They want to see a fair share come back to the region in the form of roads, in the form of a safe and reliable national highway and in the form of the same sort of social infrastructure that capital city families take for granted. Within the electorate of Dawson one of our most serious concerns is the condition and safety of our road network, a network badly damaged during a summer of natural disastersand again, this summer, there has been a lot of heavy rain in the north. I have spoken already in this place about local roads and how federal funding is needed. Peak bodies and government departments at local and state levels all agree that with the current funding levels local governments have enough money only for asset replacement. They simply do not have the money for capital investment in infrastructure and do not have the ability to keep slugging ratepayers to raise those funds. So how do we build new roads? How are we to reconstruct poor and dilapidated roads and roads damaged by heavy traffic associated with the mining boom in my region? Ratepayers cannot continue to be slugged through their rates. There is only so much money that each household has to contribute. We need to have a decent offer on the table from the federal government's roads funding program, Roads to Recovery. I do not care which colour of politics is in power, I will always be an advocate in this House for a minimum of $1 billion a year to go to the Roads to Recovery program to fund some of these roads. In addition to local roads, we have the Bruce Highway which last month was described by a RACQ spokesman as 'the most dangerous of the national highways in the country'. At about 40 deaths a year on average, it is a serious issue that the government needs to step up and improve. It is not just a matter of safety; it is a matter of reliability. Just within my electorate, the Bruce Highway has flood-prone sections that impair industry frequently for prolonged periods. We have the Goorganga Plains which cut the airport off from the tourism area of the Whitsundays. Today flights in and out of the Whitsundays have been cancelled due to a flooded Bruce Highway. We have Sandy Gully near Bowen where even a brief shower can stop workers from getting to the multibillion-dollar project in the north, Abbott Point. We have Yellow Gin Creek just before the Burdekin which is regularly flooded, cutting off access to Townsville. We have the Haughton River bridge, a small and unsafe bridge without proper guardrails. One area where the Bruce Highway also has difficulty is in Mackay due to traffic congestion. In addition to local traffic and highway traffic, we have an increasing number of trucks accessing the industrial hub and the port. We have a state government that has waited far too long to address the issue of connecting the northside residential areas with the southside and western employment areas. Now that upgrades have been made on some bridges, we still see congestion. The combination of a ring-road and a river crossing to connect the port with the industrial centre, while bypassing the city, will make the task of getting to work and getting things done a lot easier. It will free up other routes for more productive purposes. It will be faster, more efficient and more productive. I note with interest that the local state Labor member for Mackay, Tim Mulherin, recently said his idea for a ringroad would be a connector from the northern beaches of Mackay to the southside industrial area. They say imitation is the greatest form of flattery, because yours truly came up with the concept 18 months ago and put it out publicly after a discussion with the local mayor, Col Meng. I made it public during the election campaign. Maybe that is why the Leader of the House was looking at my website a few weeks ago, searching for more ideas. I can only guess that he got on Google and typed in, 'How to fix the Bruce Highway' to find my Fix the Bruce campaign. I have some advice for those opposite and the Leader of the House: stay tuned. For their information, the Fix the Bruce campaign will start in April and we will be encouraging the community to nominate areas of the Bruce Highway that need upgrading and to contact the federal Treasurer about funding it. It has become clear that the state Labor government and the federal conglomerate government are incapable of prioritising work. But we will compile information and use it when it comes to funding priorities when this government is sent to the naughty corner at the next election. While the state government has a main roads minister who would not know a ring-road from a ring hole, a minister too busy putting his left foot in and putting a press release out to fix potholes, the Liberal National Party in Queensland and the federal Liberal-National coalition have been putting together a plan. If that is their vision for the highway, they must have binoculars, because they are leaving things to the state government's 10to 20-year time frame. They are leaving this to be addressed for up to a decade or more, knowing they will be long gone from government by then and a long time from being in government again. We cannot wait a decade; we certainly cannot wait two decades for stuff to be fixed. We need a fix for the Goorganga Plains now. We need a fix for Sandy Gully now. We need a fix for Yellow Gin Creek now. We need the Haughton River bridge fixed now. We need a fair share returned to the region, so we can continue to produce the nation's wealth. The people of Dawson also need the social infrastructure and they deserve it. Just the social infrastructure promised during the election campaign would be a good start. I have growing concerns about the red tape and bureaucracy that the government is putting in place for local groups who were promised funding during the 2010 election campaign. That is a concern when you look at the long list of infrastructure that is needed. The Mackay ring-road I spoke of is a critical piece of infrastructure that will remove obstacles for the mining sector. An upgraded road network is also required in the industrial sector that services the resources sector. The upgrade should include Connors Road bridge and the duplication of Milton and Paradise Streets, taking access to four lanes. But infrastructure is more than just industrial needs; social infrastructure cannot be forgotten. Both of these projects-the ring road and the Paget upgrade-were outlined as priorities by Mackay mayor Col Meng when he recently outlined his wish list for the region with the state election there. The mayor rightly included important community and social infrastructure projects on his list. I note in particular the community's need for an upgrade to the show grounds, a $20 million redevelopment; and projects in the northern beaches of Mackay, notably a $6 million community hub and a $2.5 million injection into sporting infrastructure in that growing residential area of Mackay. The mayor knows, as do the people of North Queensland, that simply ripping money out of the regions through a mining tax or with the state government with mining royalties, not to mention through a carbon tax, is not sustainable in the long term. The government must recognise the needs of regional communities by allocating appropriate funding and getting value for the dollars that are coming out of these regions. Thank you. that encourages its citizens to expand their horizons and to dream big-a society that instils in its citizens the ethos that, with hard work, your goals, your ambitions and your aspirations are always obtainable. So embedded are these aspirational values in our culture that our generation has grown up understanding that homeownership will be reality and employment in our dream job a probability. Our generation has grown up believing that all of our aspirations are possible, because we have grown up in a country that understands the importance of fiscal responsibility, a country that has a strong society and a strong economy. But something is changing. In this country we have a Labor government that has walked away from the people it once claimed to represent. No longer can our generation afford to assume with careless confidence that our aspirations are understood and respected by the key decision makers in this country. This Labor government is betraying a generation of Australians by threatening our economic stability and way of life, and miserably failing to understand what this country needs. It is for this reason that I rise to speak today. The aspirations and goals of so many Australians are under threat due to this Labor government's self-serving survivalist nature. Instead of a respect for the forgotten Australians, the very people this government should represent, this government has chosen to pursue its own agenda, to focus internally on its own political survival instead of listening to the forgotten Australians-those hard working Australians simply trying to get ahead. This government spends most of its time listening to pollsters and spin doctors. The point is this: since this Labor government took power in 2007 home affordability and real household wealth have declined. Australians are not working any less than they were four years ago-working to own their own homes and maintain their lifestyles, the very things that they aspire to-but this Labor government have continually taken moves that have put real pressure on Australians achieving their aspirations. They have consistently made the lives of hard working Australians harder, not easier. If this Labor government were listening to those forgotten Australians, they would know that higher taxes and greater government intervention in our lives make it harder, not easier to get ahead. Let me put this into context how this Labor government has lost its way. It has delivered the four biggest budget deficits in Australian history. This government has turned a $20 billion surplus into $167 billion of accumulated deficits, by taking government spending from 22.9 per cent of gross domestic product to 26.2 per cent of GDP. It has managed to stack up a massive $133 billion of debt, equating to $6,000 for every Australian man, woman and child-a debt burden that will be carried across generations. Australians have watched as this Labor government has turned a $20 billion surplus into $100 million a day in borrowings with a $20 million a day interest bill-a bill that is having lasting damage on our fiscal position. Labor's addiction to wasteful spending is having a broad implications for Australians and Australian business. It is adding pressure to interest rates, which have begun to rise independent of Reserve Bank decisions. Debt, deficits and borrowing are nothing new for the Labor Party. As I have said in this place before, in my lifetime there has not been a single Labor budget surplus handed down. The Labor Party is heading towards its 10th consecutive deficit. Compare this with the 10 coalition surpluses out of 12 budgets. The truth of these statistics is clear: the Labor Party is under the influence of a long-term addiction to wasteful government spending. It is this addiction that has caused the four biggest budget deficits in our country's history. It is in Labor's DNA to waste taxpayers' money and produce budget deficits just as much as it is in the coalition's DNA to be prudent when spending taxpayers' money. Just like all addicts, this Labor government is making its best efforts to disguise its addiction. In a direct hit on the Australian people and the Australian way of life Labor is attempting to disguise its addiction by penalising the taxpayer. Over the past four years, Australians have been hit with 19 new and increased taxes. What that says to me is that this Labor government is making the aspirations of Australians less achievable in 19 ways. The costs of living are increasing for everyday Australians in 19 new ways. Home ownership is less affordable. Interest rates are going up. Real wages have declined. Real household wealth has declined. Net job availability has declined and productivity has stagnated. This does not paint a good picture for the future of Australia. There is a better way. We once again need a government that will scrap unnecessary taxes, cut wasteful spending and reduce the tax burden on business. Once again we need a government that is guided by a belief that governments do not have any money of their own; they only have the people's money held in trust. If Australians are to have every opportunity to achieve their aspirations, we again need a government that understands that a hand-up is always better than a handout. We need a government that understands that opportunity is always better than subsidy. We need a government that understands that all Australians should have freedom of choice and we need a government that rewards hard work instead of penalising it. We need a government that recognises that it may not have a solution to every problem, that all too often it is the problem. We need a government that does fewer things but does them better. These are the fundamental principles that will always guide us as Liberals. These are the principles that the Labor Party will never understand. While we will always believe that you know how to spend your money better than anyone else, the Labor Party will believe that the government know better than you. They will always be driven by a desire to spend more and more of your money. Let us look at Labor's record. We have seen a constant example of waste and mismanagement from a government that refuses to rein in its expenses on poorly planned and executed programs. Over the past four years, we have seen a program giving away set-top boxes at $700-something that could have been purchased and installed commercially for less than half the price. We have seen a billion dollars to install Pink Batts and then another billion dollars to pull them out again. We have seen school hall rip-offs, with a blatant disregard for taxpayers' money. All of this waste and mismanagement leaves Australians asking what the future holds for our country. This government speculate that they will repay $1.5 billion off their debt next year. Even if we are to believe this speculation, which seems highly unlikely based on their past record, even if we could count on this repayment, at this rate it will take 89 years to pay off the debt. That is like having a $20,000 credit card bill and paying $223 off the credit card in a year. At that rate, by the time Australia is once again in the black, I will be, potentially, 110 years old. That will see Australians of our generation destined to spend their entire working lives repaying this Labor debt, which was incurred in just four years. Australians are aware that we must take personal responsibility for our financial future, but Australians also rely on us as legislators to make this task as easy and as practical as possible. Australians do not expect or want governments to be acting in ways that will make this task more difficult. Yet this Labor government have left our generation to carry the burden of their reckless decisions and mismanagement across the course of our working lives. It is clear that this Labor government is out of touch with the aspirations of the people that it once claimed to represent. The last thing that the people of my community expect is that their hard earned dollars will be used to fund the waste and mismanagement of an inefficient and overly bureaucratic government. The locals in my community have a fair expectation that their government takes pressure off budgets, that their government facilitates a prosperous economy that has increasing job opportunities, that their government lives within its means, as they have to, and that their government values their money and delivers better services and infrastructure. Our country will face challenges in the future. Our generation will carry the debt burden of Labor. Our generation will see the challenges of an ageing population whereby we will inevitably have a much greater burden on government, drawing from a smaller tax base. We will face the challenges of a post mining boom economy. We as a nation must meet these challenges from a position of strength. We must take advantage of the opportunities that we now have. To meet these challenges we need to grow the productive capacity of the economy and we need to see more Australians earning higher real wages. It is here that we see the fundamental philosophical divide in our nation. While Labor still believe that they can tax a nation into prosperity, we as Liberals know the exact opposite to be true. As the great forefather of the Liberal tradition in this country, Sir Robert Menzies, said, 'We are a tax reduction party.' Menzies understood then, as the coalition does today, that 'real tax reductions would be the best of all incentives to increase effort, earnings and production'. As I said in my first speech in this place, it is the Liberal side of politics that is the side of opportunity. We are the party based on encouragement rather than on subsidy and on a hand up rather than on a hand down. It is because of these philosophical beliefs that we will always fight for lower taxes, smaller and more efficient government and the individual's right to choose. It is these principles and this core belief held by the coalition which underline the fundamental difference between the coalition and this Labor government. A coalition government will cut the waste and mismanagement; it will respect the money of the people of Australia. Under a coalition government we will see high productivity, job growth, sustainable development and a modern enterprise economy that eradicates barriers to opportunity and engagement. Under a coalition government the $133 billion of Labor debt will be paid down and the country will stop borrowing $100 million every day. We will put downward pressure on interest rates, helping Australian small businesses and families, easing the cost of living and rising operating costs for businesses. We in the coalition believe that we need to maximise every available opportunity to plan for our future. We believe that the key to a strong prosperous economy is to get spending down so that we can get productivity up. That means less borrowing, lower pressure on interest rates and less tax. The two sides of politics could not be further apart. Popular media all too often claim that the major political parties are moving closer together. This could not be further from the truth. There is only one side of politics with a strong plan for Australia's future. We believe in a nation of limitless opportunities, but we also understand that to achieve our aspirations we need to prepare for the future. May I, once again, look to Menzies. When Menzies launched the first Liberal Party campaign, he said: We need to return to politics as a clash of principles and to get away from the notion that it is a clash only of warring personalities. The modern Labor Party is nothing more than a clash of personalities, a modern political party devoid of any principles, driven only by pollsters and spin doctors. We on this side of the chamber are prepared to debate principles. We on this side of the chamber, continuing in the Liberal tradition, stand for lower taxes, smaller government and an individual's choice. Menzies was correct when he said 'We are a tax reduction party,' which stands in stark contrast to the 19 new or increased taxes of this Labor government. It is our commitment to these principles that saw the previous coalition government deliver a 20 per cent increase in real wages, a 100 per cent increase in the net wealth for each Australian and more than two million new jobs. Higher productivity cannot be mandated by government. It does not come from government interference. Higher productivity is born out of creativity and ingenuity of hard working Australians. It occurs when businesses are part of a strong economy and are set free from red tape. The coalition will achieve higher productivity by cutting red tape for small businesses, helping small businesses with their books by putting downward pressure on interest rates and operating costs. A coalition government will save $1 billion a year in red tape expenses by requiring government departments and agencies to set targets to reduce regulations and quantify the cost of their regulations. The coalition has a strong plan for Australia, a plan that will see a stronger economy by getting government spending down and productivity up. We will stop the borrowing and repay the debt, easing the pressure on Australians and allowing their aspirations to once again become tangible realities. As the elected representatives of the Australian people our greatest responsibility in this place is to make the lives of those we represent easier, not harder. The coalition will once again restore hope, reward and opportunity to Australian society. an historic event in the life of the parliament in that a Prime Minister has been challenged, and in the lead up to that there were conversations between the challenger and his constituency, which were the front and back benches of the Labor Party and, to a further extent, a jump to the hearts and minds of the Australian people through the press corps and any other medium that may have been opportune for the member to get a message across. In doing so I saw a light at the end of the tunnel, that the combined wisdom of the parliamentary party of the Labor Party was looking at a review of the carbon tax through the challenger. Having said that, it was a hope not only for Australia but for my electorate of McMillan and the electorate of Gippsland, where we are sitting on perhaps thousands of years of brown coal opportunity and all of the issues that surround the emissions controls that we need to look at as a nation, and which the world is also looking at. In the consideration that perhaps a change of leadership was to happen in this House today, one leader said, 'I would review the carbon tax if I became Prime Minister of this country again.' For me, that was a ray of hope that some consensus of common sense might come into the debate. Like all members of parliament I get bombarded from both sides of the emissions argument, and that is for us to deal with as we sift through the information we are given on any issue to try to come up with what is best for the nation, the Australian people and future opportunities. WhatI saw in this possible review was a clear intention that the road we have gone down at the moment with regard to the carbon tax is wrong for the nation on many counts. The main one is that at this time, when the dollar is at the heights that it is, our manufacturing is under pressure because of that. Growth opportunities for small businessthe ideas and the research and the development that have gone into possible new products that may go onto the market across the world born out of Australian ideas and opportunitieshave a pressure on them now because of the high Australian dollar. That makes it more difficult for them. Of course, in my simple thinking if you then invade that situation with a tax that will make us more disadvantaged, you are going to come to a place where the rest of the world must be",190,Bills
193,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (16:30,"TodayI cannot help but note that there has beenlooking at us and saying, 'Why, when you supposedly have all these things going for you, are you imposing a tax in front of what the world is doing without consideration of what it is going to do to your own economy, nationally?' You have the protagonist in the former Prime Minister saying, 'Look, there's an issue here.' So why did we have the tax in the first place? We did not have the tax in the first place because either of the major parties desired it. That was not the reason we had the tax. We had the Prime Minister of the day, Ms Gillard, before an election campaign only 18 months ago, say, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Why did she say that when the broad consensus of the leadership of the Labor Party at that time was, 'The carbon tax is not for this country at this time'? She was brutal and forthright in that election campaign. She said to the Australian people many times through that same press gallery, through television and however else she wanted to get that message across, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government that I lead.' So why did we get a carbon tax? On the other side, Mr Abbott said that as sure as light follows day there will be a carbon tax. But the truth was that both parties were saying that there would not be a carbon tax, even though they had said previously that we would move towards an emissions trading scheme. I spoke to an elderly lady the other day who said, 'Russell, we really should be doing something about our emissions.' There is concern in the community about our emissions. We get the story. But for the next 30 years we are reliant on coal. So we have some issues to deal with as a nation. Both sides of the House told the Australian people honestly that there will not be a carbon tax under the governments we lead. So why did we get a carbon tax? Why has this legislation come before the House? Why did one of the protagonists for the leadership today say, 'I'll review the carbon tax when it is put in place'? There is concern within our business community on two counts. One: do not say you are going to do something and then not do it and do not say you are not going to do something and then do it, because that confuses all of us as to how we go about our business. Two: now that we have got the tax, we have to deal with it. But now it is suggested by a future leader of the Labor Party that it would be reviewed with a view to reducing it in order to bring it in line with the rest of the world. So, instead of the carbon tax being $23, it would be $5. But, hang on, you have not got the money for the compensation that you offered the people of Australia, and they still want that compensation-but you will not have the money for it. We heard from the two previous speakers how this tax may affect individuals in their communities. That is not what I am on about. Why did we get this tax when the collective parliamentary wisdom said that we should not have it at this time because it will be detrimental to the nation? But, long term, the collective wisdom of the parliament was saying that we have to do something about our emissions. We have to do something because the Australian people gave us a hung parliament. A minority group was needed to form government. Out of 150 members in the House, one person in the House meant do or die for the Labor government. The deal was: you will give us a carbon tax or you do not get the member for Melbourne's vote. SoI say to the people of Australia and to the truck drivers who are moving across this nation at the moment, if you are feeling under threat it is not because of the collective wisdom of the parliament, it is because of a deal done with the leader of the Greens for a carbon tax. It is not an emissions trading scheme but a carbon tax set at a price that is four times the price that has been set in the rest of the world. In my simple opinion, we will be four times as disadvantaged in our dealings into the future as we would otherwise have been with an emissions trading scheme, which would balance itself with carbon trading around the rest of the world. So all the Australian people are held hostage for this three-year period to one vote on a most important issue that affects every family and every business-every butcher, baker and life maker. AndI do not think that is right. Personally, I am opposed to the carbon tax as it stands today. I am opposed to the carbon tax. I am opposed to the carbon tax because of the burden that it puts on my energy producers in the Latrobe Valley and therefore the workers in those industries-the threat to their livelihood and all that has gone before. Some would argue that CO2 emissions are not an issue. Others would argue that they are a future issue and that global warming is terribly important. I let the scientists argue. I am of the opinion that we should take out insurance and work towards reducing global emissions, but not throw ourselves on the altar of the green movement for the sake of holding this government together. Perhaps we should have just gone straight back to an election campaign again and had it all out, and let the Australian people decide, so that good governance could come back into this place. Now this government has done a deal with the Greens with one vote in the House, and we have a carbon tax that both parties said was inappropriate for Australia at this time. This is not the way we should be running the nation for the best. I have heard a lot about the best interests of the Australian people. A lot of cliches have been used this week that take just about anything to mean, 'We are working in the best interests of the Australian people.' I summon all the integrity that I may have to say that I hope they are working in the best interests of the Australian people with regard to our competitiveness overseas, our exports and everything we do, including our education exports. We actually need students from overseas to come here, have their education here, take it back and in turn make their own country wealthy. But outside of saying that, this carbon tax that we are burdening upon ourselves for only political reasons, not for the good governance of the nation, is wrong, and we should be stepping back from it. If the leadership of the Labor Party had changed today, we would have been changing that within a few months. We would have been saying: 'No, this carbon tax is wrong. Yes, we can move to an emissions trading scheme, but this carbon tax that we are imposing on people right across the nation is wrong. It is wrong for the nation. It is wrong for the best outcome for the Australian people.' I know there are people overseas looking at us today and saying: 'Why are you doing this? You are crazy. It's not to the benefit of your country.' We have not limitless resources anymore, although I believe this nation will be, once again, a wealthy nation. But one day the mining boom is going to be over, and we are going to be relying on what we produce, and what we sell, and what we grow and the other things we have on our side. What we have had on our side for a long time has been cheap electricity so we can manufacture. I am not talking about how we should be into old-fashioned manufacturing, because this nation needs to get the best it possibly can out of its education system, to put us at the forefront of what we may be exporting into the future, which is our intelligence, and we have been very good at it. SoI say to you, Deputy Speaker, today, on behalf of all Australians, that the government of the day should be taking the former Prime Minister's advice and doing a full review of our position with regard to this carbon tax, at risk of losing government. When will we have a government or a Prime Minister that puts the Australian people first, that puts the Australian economy first, that puts Australian business first? Because if you put business first, you put workers first as well-their health, their well-being, their future, their generations. I am keen today to make the point-I did not miss it. If Mr Rudd had been elected today, we would have had a review of this terrible tax. This tax is not good for this nation, not good for small business, not good for medium sized business and not good for big business. Therefore, it is not good for Australia. I plead with the government: have a review of this tax, have some strength, have the guts to stand up and say, 'All right, we know it's a deal with the Greens, but we are prepared to review it as a government.' Ms GAMBARO (Brisbane) (16:45): I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20112012 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012. These pieces of legislation give us a change to again highlight the massive waste and the irresponsible misuse of government expenditure by this Labor government. Underlying this is a complete lack of respect for taxpayers' money. Tax revenue is not government money; it is money given to the government by the taxpayers on trust. The men and women of Australia who work hard and pay their fair share of taxes have the right to expect that it will be spent on their behalf in a very responsible way. That is why it is such a shame that we continue to see their funds being abused by the Gillard government. We know that, since the election of the Rudd government in 2007, approximately $4 billion of expenditure has been wasted by Labor. The trend, unfortunately, continues. The very latest example is the set-top box scheme. This scheme, whilst currently incomplete, is running at approximately $700 per set-top box. That is roughly what was originally estimated. It is many times the amount for which they can be purchased at a retail level. We heard the revelations from Senate estimates that the NBN Co. has used the services of UMR Research, the Labor Party pollsters, to do polling. In an article by Lauren Wilson in the Australian on 15 February 2012, we see that the NBN Co. has spent $35 million on legal fees. That is an enormous amount of money. And yet this massive white elephant has only rolled out active broadband to approximately 4,000 customers. Then we move to the rebranding of the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. This little exercise has blown out by five times the original $42,000 that was budgeted for. You would never, ever get away with this in the private sector. It demonstrates that those opposite have no appreciation for a dollar, because hardly any of them have ever been involved in the management of a business. That rebranding followed the $31.5 million that was spent on government advertising trying to sell another white elephant, the carbon tax, to the Australian people. This was subsequently criticised by the Auditor-General. Then we come to the most outrageous of them all: the massive blow-out in the Department of Immigration and Citizenship's budget. Across the entire immigration portfolio, and not including last year's blow-out, the increase for the four years to 2014-15 is $759 million. This is $559 million more than, or almost three times, the $197 million the Treasurer and Minister Bowen told taxpayers the bill would be for immigration when they released the MYEFO for the period last November. In just two months the government appears to have blown out their estimates by almost $560 million. The blow-out revealed in these estimates takes the total budget blow-out from Labor's border protection failures over the three years since the 200910 budget to a massive $3.9 billion. And all of this is because of the fateful winding back of the Howard government's border protection measures. In direct contrast to the failed Labor policies, the coalition has a plan to stop the boats and therefore save money by reintroducing temporary protection visas and also restarting the processing of illegal maritime arrivals at Nauru. The shame of all this is that, because of the shameful waste and misappropriation, there are now so many worthwhile projects that will not be funded. I want to talk about some of these local projects that I have been made aware of recently and that I have been happy to support. I spoke in the House recently about the Mental Illness Fellowship of Queensland, which is in my electorate and is trying to get assistance to fund the redevelopment of a new headquarters in Herston. This organisation provides a tremendous service to people across Queensland that suffer from some form of mental health illness. Its new building will be a headquarters, providing mental health support and services. Given that this issue is so important in our community, I really do urge the approval of the application. There is another current grant application that has recently come to the attention of our office. It is by the Kelvin Grove State College. This fine institution is one of the area's oldest established secondary colleges and enjoys a fine reputation in the local community. The college accommodates approximately 1,800 students from prep to year 12 and offers a number of signature sport excellence programs. The purpose of their particular grant was for a rebuilding of their current tennis facilities. I understand Kelvin Grove's courts had not had a major refurbishment for over 25 years. This project will enable the college and the wider community to have access to four international-standard tennis courts which can be used both day and night on seven days a week. As the college is home to the Queensland Tennis School of Excellence, this refurbishment is absolutely necessary for a standard suitable for elite players. I also bring to the attention of the House, and express my support for, an application from the Sisters of the Good Samaritan Foundation for funding to assist with the marketing expenses of an important community educational program. The Good Sams foundation, as they are known, provide a wide range of essential community and welfare services in Brisbane. Their key role at the moment is to provide supported accommodation for women and children escaping domestic violence. The foundation plans to run a domestic violence awareness workshop, called Breaking the Silence, in a selected number of Brisbane schools and in the general community. This program will address an urgent and genuine need to promote a very difficult topic which is quite sensitive. The aim is to increase awareness and understanding of the many forms of domestic violence and to offer resources in such a way that the victim can remained unidentified and yet benefit from the courses provided within a session. Hopefully, through awareness we will reduce the number of future victims. The Good Sams foundation would like to supplement the workshop with printed brochures and marketing tools such as a banner and data projection for PowerPoint presentation. These items will be an ongoing resource to attendees and the foundation. NowI turn to Telecross, another very worthwhile initiative with a program of enormous benefit to the community. It is a program on which I have been working with the Red Cross for a couple of years. The proposal is to set up a system whereby a staff member or a volunteer is scheduled to ring every day an elderly person or a disabled person or an older person who is socially isolated in our community and ensure that they are okay. This is a wonderful idea and I am very supportive of it because there are many people living alone in their homes who do not have too much external contact. Say they fall or have an incident: many elderly people are often found in their homes many weeks or months later. This is a wonderful prevention program because it ensures that a phone call is only a short while away. The program has many community aspects and it involves volunteers. A large number of organisations, including the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, have indicated in the past that they will support the program. It is a low-cost service that will cover the whole of Australia. I estimate its cost at about $9 million and it will save us from the terrible scourge, and the terrible reports that we see, of elderly people being discovered in their homes many months or weeks after an adverse event. No society should go through that. We owe our elderly people our support. RecentlyI was at the Kitchener Road Childcare Centre. This is an occasional day care centre and this Gillard government has ripped $12.6 million out of occasional care funding. Occasional care funding gives mums a break if they need to go to a doctor, or if they need to have an operation. They do not want long day care funding, they just want a day here or there that will help them, a day where they can have a dentist appointment or do some occasional study. This is such a worthwhile program, and the Kitchener Road Childcare Centre has been going for over 40 years. It was a very solemn meeting that I attended. Some 60 parents showed up. They have already increased fees. They do not have the option of fundraising. They have looked at different ways to apply for government funding. They do not have the money to convert the centre into a long day care centre. They have funding available until 30 June this year, and after that their future is pretty uncertain. That centre needs $40,000 a year-a very small amount but it impacts on the lives of many families, parents and children. It is worthwhile programs like that that had money ripped out. Many families are being hurt. Then you look at the millions and millions of dollars that are wasted on programs like the pink batts program. That very small amount of money is providing so much community support. Programs like Kitchener Road Childcare Centre are so important to the local community and yet we see other programs where millions are wasted. The government continues on its misguided and incoherent policies, leading to mismanagement. You just keep reading about it and seeing it. As a federal member of parliament I constantly see these examples of incompetence. The budget deficit is now at $37 billion and rising. Each day it continues to grow. I have a little widget on my website reminding my constituents every day of the levels of debt that continue to rise under this Gillard government. The carbon tax and the recent private health rebate cuts will come into force on 1 July and they will further add to the cost of living for businesses and families in the electorate of Brisbane. But this government stumbles along blindly, too focused on itself and not on the real issues that face everyday Australian families. It prefers instead to wind the clock back 30 years and play that class warfare card and the politics of envy. This 1970s type attitude has no place in modern Australia. This country desperately needs an election to give the Australian people a say on who they want to lead this country through the difficult challenges ahead. I call on this government and I call on the Independents to do the right thing and allow an election to be held so that the people of Australia can decide what direction they want to go in. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). It certainly has been interesting to watch the theatre over the past week. We see a government tearing itself apart-not focused on the needs of the people of Australia, not focused on our future, but busy fighting amongst themselves over the leadership of their political party. We see a Prime Minister who has lost the trust of the Australian people. We see a Prime Minister whose word is not considered fair dinkum by most Australians. They have seen the promise the Prime Minister made that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led. They saw the promise that the government made to the member for Denison in relation to gambling reform. They saw the promised east Timor solution. On all of these issues, statements were clearly made and clearly articulated by the Prime Minister-an actual statement put not only in words but in writing with the member for Denison, promising that the Prime Minister, as a precondition to her forming a government, would support mandatory precommitment on poker machines. And what happened? As soon as it suited this Prime Minister, she abandoned that promise and we were left with just another example of how this Prime Minister cannot be trusted. We also see that the Australian people cannot trust this Prime Minister and this government with money. Before us today we have appropriation bills, and the theme of my contribution today will be the endless waste and mismanagement of this government, because whenever this government tries to fix something it seems to get worse. Whenever this government has a new scheme to save us money, we seem to end up deeper in debt. When this government plans to save the planet, we find that our jobs in our factories and in our businesses start moving offshore. Of course this is just a political game for the government with the aim of clinging to power just a little longer. But, for the people I represent, the government's dysfunction and mismanagement is having a real impact on day-to-day living. Full-time, wellpaid jobs are more difficult to find because employers are hesitant about the future, and interest rates are higher than they need to be because of the actions of this government. The actions of this government through new taxes are eating into family budgets and, on top of all that, the impact of the carbon tax is yet to be realised. To give you an example of how out of touch this government is, we discovered recently that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry which was allocated more than $100 million through these bills, recently spent $77,627 on rebranding. Consultants encouraged the department to change its mission statement to exclude the words 'agriculture', 'fisheries' and 'forestry'. Is there anything more absurd than to have a rebranding exercise that removed the words 'agriculture', 'fisheries' and 'forestry'? The farmers and fishermen in my electorate do not care how the department is branded. What they want is freedom from a carbon tax and some degree of confidence that the government understands and respects the work that they do. Of course, we know this government has failed also in the area of border protection policy, with an additional cost of over $330 million in this year alone. When the Rudd Labor government was elected in 2007, illegal immigration was barely a blip on the political radar or on the budget papers due to the Howard government's strong border protection policies. But, when the Labor government started to roll back the coalition's border protection policies in favour of a policy proudly authored by the now Prime Minister, the boats started arriving and costs started to grow-costs that are being met by the taxpaying men and women of",198,Wyatt Roy Longman 16 15 The Australian Society That I Believe In Is A Society
194,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (16:58,"I welcome the opportunity to speak onAustralia. The additional estimates released by the government recently show a blow-out of a third of the budget in asylum seeker costs: some $866 million to 2014-15. This is almost $560 million more than the figure released in MYEFO only two months ago. The immigration budget now is $2.7 billion for this year alone. Processing and detaining boat arrivals has become a multibillion dollar task which is draining funds away from more productive tasks. The government would not have had to rip $2.4 billion out of private health insurance if it had not dismantled the Howard government's strong border protection policies. The irony of the government's wasteful spending is that the Prime Minister promised before the last election that she would maintain spending restraint, yet everywhere you look there are cost blow-outs. Unfortunately, we have come to realise just what a promise from this Prime Minister is worth and we now know a promise from this Prime Minister is worth absolutely nothing. The member for Griffith knows the value of a promise by this Prime Minister. He knows more than anyone. Ms Marino: The member for Denison. from this Prime Minister. He knows all too well, with a document signed in blood by the Prime Minister to support mandatory precommitment. What happens when the pressure is on? We just walk away. With friends like that, who needs enemies? The Australian people now know exactly how much a promise from this Prime Minister is worth. That is why I concur with my colleague the member for Brisbane, who said, 'What is needed now is an election'-and it very much is. The people of Australia are sick of broken promises. The people of Australia are sick of having a Prime Minister they can no longer trust. The people of Australia are sick of hollow words. We heard all too clearly her promise in relation to the carbon tax, and many people trusted the Prime Minister at that time, to their detriment. Small businesses in my electorate are very concerned about that broken promise on carbon tax. The tourism industry in my electorate is very concerned about that broken promise in relation to the carbon tax. Unfortunately, the carbon tax which we were not going to have and which we are getting on 1 July is going to make it much more difficult for those businesses to survive and compete with competitors overseas. It is of great concern. We are seeing a total lack of confidence out in the community, and a major driver of that lack of confidence is that people have no faith in this government. The small business community has dramatically lost faith in business conditions and in this government because they see a government that is not in control. They see a government that is out of control and is too busy fighting itself to be concerned about the issues that are important. Increasing prices are flowing through to aviation. Qantas is having to increase its fares. Those fare increases have already taken effect for flights after 1 July, and that is going to have an adverse effect on travel to my electorate in the very important tourism industry. We see other countries defending their airlines against a ridiculous carbon tax. We see the Chinese and the Americans standing up for their airline industries. But what does our Prime Minister do? She just rolls over and plays dead. We do not mind slugging our aviation industry with a carbon tax. We do not mind one bit. We do not care if it is going to put people out of work. We do not care if it is going to have an adverse effect on our tourism industry. We are going to sit there and do nothing in relation to international airlines and we are going to actively work against our airline industry in relation to our local carriers. Many airlines around the",204,Wyatt Roy Longman 16 15 The Australian Society That I Believe In Is A Society
195,Mr Hartsuyker,"The member for Denison, as I said, knows the value of a promiseworld will be flying carbon tax free. Their governments were wise enough to realise that this is a tax that is bad for our country and that is not going to improve the environment one bit. Let me quote the words of Professor Garnaut in relation to the price rises under a carbon tax. Professor Garnaut said: These higher prices will require households to spend a greater proportion of their incomes to obtain the same goods and services purchased before the introduction of an emissions price. This will reduce households’ real incomes and purchasing power. I could not agree with him more. He has really belled the cat. This will reduce households' real incomes and purchasing power. Thank you to this government. Thank you to the Independents for supporting this carbon tax, which is so unpopular in their electorates. What does the government say? They say: 'Don't worry. Some of you will be 20c a week better off.' The Prime Minister says, 'Trust me.' Twenty cents a week better off! IfI were the member for DenisonI would not be trusting the Prime Minister that you could be 20c a week better off. IfI were the average Australian I would not be trusting this Prime Minister that I would be 20c a week better off. IfI were a small business person, apart from the impact on my business I would be very concerned about that 20c margin of error. Twenty cents! This is a government that said we were going to have a $22 billion deficit this year, and it blew out to $37 billion. They were out billions and billions in their budget forecast, yet their forecast in relation to the adequacy of compensation-and we will get to compensation in a momentdepends on a margin of error of 20c. I think average Australians are, rightfully, worried about this. As I said, they do not trust this Prime Minister and they certainly would not trust a 20c margin of error. Another issue that is of great concern is the wasteful spending in the NBN. The coalition agrees there is a need for high-speed broadband. Every Australian should have access to high speed broadband. We saw a project which, in the true way this government does things, started off at $4.3 billion-fibre to the node; a fairly workable solution. But then there was a rethink. A feasibility study was done by Senator Conroy and the then Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, on the back of a drink coaster on a flight to Perth, and what did we get? A $4.3 billion project blew out to a $50 billion project almost overnight. That would have to be the mother of all cost overruns. Ms Marino: And it is not over yet. over yet because day by day we see prices blow out. Day by day we see low take-up rates. Day by day we see the very business plan that underpins the NBN falling apart. The connections are not meeting up with what is anticipated, the speed of construction is nowhere near what is required to meet the business plan estimates, and the cost is blowing out. On April Fools' Day last year we saw that the tender process had to be abandoned. They had 14 tenderers, they went out to the market, and what did the market say? You have not got enough money, guys. You have not budgeted enough. It is going to cost us more. So miraculously, and again there becomes an issue of trust, through a magic process a contract was struckMs Marino: A magic pudding! do not know what it says; it is completely secret; it is commercial-in-confidence; but we have to trust this government that the contract with Silcar has not exposed taxpayers or the",205,Wyatt Roy Longman 16 15 The Australian Society That I Believe In Is A Society

197,Mr Hartsuyker,"Yes, it was a magic pudding. A contract was struck with Silcar. WeAustralian government to increased risk of cost overruns. We do not know what risks we have bought for this contract with Silcar, but I think it is a pretty fair bet that we cannot trust this government. I think it is a pretty fair bet and it is of great concern. Yes, we want high-speed broadband; but we want it done in a timely way and we want it done within a reasonable budget. A $50 billion budget, which is going north, is not reasonable, is not sustainable and is of great concern. Another concern is the fact that this project is not targeting the worse areas first, and that is a most important thing. It would be common sense to look at those areas where broadband is most deficient and start attacking them immediately. But what do we do? We have a largely politically motivated rollout that picked the eyes out of the politically appropriate sites and have a duplication of services where broadband is already adequate-we actually pay taxpayers' money; we pay Telstra and we pay Opel for nothing more than not to compete with the NBN. Now, if this project were so incredibly superior, as the government would make out, would you not think that market forces would drive people to rush in hordes to the NBN? They would be like barbarians at the gate, trying to get in and get connected. But what happens? We saw in Armidale a take-up rate of two per cent! Ms Marino: And 18,000 in total. fibre. We have got another 2,000 on satellite. We have got about 18,000 people connected but not using. So it is a pretty small total. And it is of concern that so much money has been poured into it without a feasibility study. This was a government that came to power promising total assessment of major investment decisions. We had Infrastructure Australia formedMs Marino: To let the sunlight in irradiated with a new warmth and a new glow and we were going to feel confident! What have we got? We have got a Prime Minister who cannot be trusted and a project that is running off the rails. It is north of $50 billion. Who knows where it is going to end? It is of concern. This government cannot manage money. This government cannot be trusted. This government should be facing the people. People should be offered an election so that they can pass their judgment on this government for all of its faults-too many to mention here in the 15 minutes I have available to speak. and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012, which are in front of us. I would like to use the opportunity, if I may, to discuss three important national issues which are confronting my electorate. My electorate is in suburban Melbourne. It is very much a middle-income electorate, 15 or so kilometres out from the centre of Melbourne. It is made up of middleclass families, hard-working people and small business people-aspirational people. So the issues which confront them, I believe, also are very likely to be issues that confront the broader Australian community. There are three issues particularly which they have been raising with me which I would like to touch on today: cost-of-living pressures, job security and manufacturing. The first, cost-of-living pressures, would be one of the issues which gets constantly raised with me when I am out in the community, and I am sure other members equally would have this issue raised with them.

200,Mr Tudge (Aston) (17:13,"I also rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012school fetes, it gets raised when you are at the footy or cricket clubs on the weekends. The reason is that people know that the cost-of-living pressures on basic household goods are rising more rapidly than their wages or pensions. These are not discretionary items; these are the necessary items which you and I and every family has to rely upon: petrol, food and groceries, electricity, water, medical expenses and the like. These are the things that are going up well in excess of wages or the official CPI indexation rate. The difficulties which constituents of mine articulate to me are backed up by the official statistics. When you look at the official statistics of some of these basic household necessities you see that they have gone up already by an extraordinary amount. For example, people's water bills have gone up by 46 per cent since 2008. Their electricity bills have gone up by 50 per cent since 2008-an enormous increase in electricity bills, which, of course, directly impacts on your household budget. It is something that you cannot not use, particularly in winter and particularly in a cooler climate like Melbourne, where you do need to have your heater on. If you are a pensioner, you are often in your house all day and you need to have your heater on. Gas prices have gone up 30 per cent since 2008; medical expenses have gone up 20 per cent since 2008. I think you are starting to get the picture, Deputy Speaker Oakeshott: the official statistics directly back up what constituents and local residents on the ground are telling me and telling other members in this chamber. There are many reasons why prices go up in excess of the CPI or of our wages. Of course, there are supply and demand issues which impact prices. But a government can also have a significant impact on prices through its policy settings. My critique is that this government's policy settings have been set in the wrong direction and so they are deliberately putting prices up unnecessarily. That is unforgivable. Yes, of course, prices will increase over time because of supply and demand pressures, but, when the government itself is causing prices to go up, that is what is unforgivable. I want to talk about a few areas where this government has done that. Let me start with the macro level, because at the macro level if you run large budget deficits, which this government has now for four years in a row-$37 billion this year, $50-odd billion, a further $50 billion the year before; the three biggest budget deficits in Australian history-that puts upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on interest rates. That is the first criticism that I have of the government. Its fiscal policy puts upward pressure on all prices and upward pressure on interest rates. My second criticism is at the individual level. When you look at individual items, again the government is having an impact on prices going up. Let me start again with electricity. High electricity prices is something that is hurting everybody, and it is particularly hurting pensioners and other people on low incomes or low fixed incomes. What is the government doing? To start with, some of its renewable energy policies, which have been poorly designed, are putting up electricity prices. On top of that is what is coming on 1 July, as all of us in this chamber know. From the government's own figures, the carbon tax will add an additional 10 per cent to the price of electricity. If you ask the electricity sector, they will tell you it is a 20 per cent increase. There will be a 10 per cent increase in the first year alone, let alone in subsequent years when the carbon tax is legislated to increase. So electricity prices will continue to go up through a measure of the government. That is my critique. Let me look at gas prices. Again, with the carbon tax, gas prices are forecast to increase by nine per cent in the first year alone and will continue to go up. Let us look at child care, another item that is not a discretionary expenditure. If there are two parents at work or if you are a single parent who works, you need to put your child into child care. What has the government done in relation to child care? The first thing they did was cap the rebate so that many families are hitting that cap. But that is not the worse thing. In my view, the worse thing they have done is change the childcare staff-to-child ratios. Whereas it was one staff member to five children, they changed it and mandated that, from 1 January this year, it must be one staff member to four children. As you can appreciate, in a childcare centre your staffing is your major operational cost so, if you force a childcare centre to go from five to one to four to one, you are in essence increasing your operational costs by about 20 per cent. That flows directly through to childcare prices. You could say that that is improving the quality of the childcare centre. But I ask what the government has to do with this when: (a) there is no categorical research that says four to one is better than five to one; and (b) why can't parents themselves decide in their own right whether they want four to one or five to one? If they are happy with five to one, they can go along to that and it will be a cheaper childcare centre. If they want four to one, I am sure there would be a childcare centre where there is a four to one ratio. I mention one childcare centre in my community. A woman I have mentioned before in this chamber, Mrs Kulkarni, has written to me saying that there has been a 21 per cent increase in the fees for her this year. She asked: Why are we being penalised for working hard and paying our taxes? The changes in staff-to-children ratios will not make a life-changing impact on my two-year-old now or over the next three years until he starts school. All of us were very happy with the care being provided before. But, no, the government here in Canberra knows what is best for my constituents in outer eastern Melbourne! That is what I find egregious. We have residents who are happy with the service and we have childcare centres happy with the service they are providing. But what does the government do? It has to get its fingers in there and say, 'Oh, no, it's not good enough for the childcare centre and not good enough for the parents; it's got to be four to one,' and as a result the prices will go up by 21 per cent. Thanks very much! What will happen then? Parents will pull their kids out and parents will not be able to work. We have a participation problem that is contributing to a lack of productivity, which is a problem. It is poor policy design like this from an overbearing government which is also contributing to price increases. Health care is the next item on my list. We debated this last week. Changes to the health insurance rebate will cause an increase in all health insurance premiums, which will go up by an estimated 10 per cent across the board, according to Deloitte. That will mean that some people will pull out and go to the already overburdened public hospital system, and for the taxpayer overall it will be more expensive. I fail to see how that is good public policy. It just adds to the cost-of-living pressures of everyday families in my electorate and, indeed, across Australia. It is not just the policy designs that have led to price increases; there have also been a number of targeted tax increases which have put up prices for everybody on things like cigarettes, motor cars and alcohol. Prices have been forced up for residents. The carbon tax will add an additional $400 to the cost of an Australian made motor car. It will not be added to the cost of a Hyundai, coming in from South Korea, but it will be added to the cost of a Holden, a Toyota or a Ford, which are built right here in Melbourne and South Australia. It is unbelievable. Do you think that will make a difference to the climate? Will the weather be different because we are adding $400 to the cost of an Australia made motor car? No, it will not. All it will do is make those motor cars more expensive for Australians and lose jobs in the Australian motor car industry. Not only have we had taxes increased but we have had benefits reduced. In the last budget many people had their family tax benefits A and B frozen. Over 10,000 people in my electorate alone were impacted by that. Even microbusinesses at the micro level-the lowincome, independent business owners-have now lost the entrepreneurs tax offset, which provided a little bit of tax relief for those microbusinesses earning less than $75,000 a year. At the macro level we have a poor policy setting. We have taxes up across the board, we have poor policy design in a number of areas-which puts up prices-and in many cases we have had benefits removed. All of those things contribute to cost-of-living pressures for everyday Australians both in my electorate and across Australia. That is my criticism of the government. Sure, there are supply and demand issues, but my key criticism is that they have put in place poor policies, increased taxes or removed benefits because they are trying to get control of their budget, which is presently completely out of control. In the last couple of minutes I have available to me, let me touch on job security and manufacturing. We know that job security is an emerging issue in this nation. The unemployment figure is at 5.2 per cent, but I believe that that significantly underestimates the real figure. Roy Morgan estimates that it is more like 10.3 per cent and, if you also include the underemployed, it is 17.8 per cent. Those are extraordinary figures. I am not suggesting that governments can just create all of these jobs. The government cannot create jobs; businesses create jobs. We as a nation need to make the business environment attractive for businesses to thrive. That means lowering taxes, getting the budget under control so that interest rates can be lower. It means a more flexible industrial relations system where individuals and bosses can come to some sort of agreement which is mutually beneficial for them both. It means incentives for R&D so that innovation can be the real driver for productivity. It means generally creating a sense of hope for our business community that there will not be another hit around the corner, which is presently what many businesses currently think. If you put those sorts of things in place, that is how you get productivity, job creation and businesses to thrive. Indeed, that is how we will best support our manufacturing industry. It cannot be sustained by having the government throwing money at it. It will only be sustainable in the longer term if those businesses are profitable in their own right. We can help achieve that by creating a strong business environment. Ms MARINO (Forrest-Opposition Whip) (17:29): Unfortunately for the people in my electorate and those right around the country these bills, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20112012 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012, are the latest evidence that the Labor government is utterly incompetent. It cannot manage the Australian economy and it cannot even manage its own programs. These bills are classic and practical examples. The government created a massive problem when it changed the coalition's proven strong border protection policies. In fact, the total blow-out in asylum seeker management costs since the 2009-10 budget, revealed in the latest estimates, is $3.9 billion. Over 15,000 people have arrived as a result. You have raised some important issues, member for Aston, and I ask: who was paying? I think we know-our electricians, our plumbers, our teachers, our nurses, our truck drivers, our farmers and our small businesses are all paying for this. Once again the Labor government is imposing more cost and more debt-$3.1 billion alone in these bills-on hard-working, aspirational Australian taxpayers. The government is doing this simply because it is dreadfully incompetent and absolutely addicted to wasteful spending. This government is borrowing $100 million every single day just to feed the greatest net debt our nation has ever seen. It has borrowed $136 billion and counting, which is larger than the disgraceful debt legacy of the Hawke-Keating Labor era. It also has cumulative deficits of $167 billion. They are appalling figures. In 2007, Australia's total budget was $272 billion, but, as a result of the government's spending, it is expected in 2011 to be $370 billion plus. That is an increase in spending of $100 billion-40 per cent. Also, the government has lifted the gross debt ceiling from the 2007 level of $75 billion to $250 billion. The government has disgracefully wasted billions on its pet projects such as pink batts, which cost $2.5 billion and counting and is still wasting taxpayers' dollars even in this misnamed 'clean-out phase'. I see in one of the newspapers that nearly a quarter of the jobs in the program now are either unsafe or substandard, so it is still costing. I believe the Australian people deserve to know the full extent of this out-of-control but tragic debacle. The judicial inquiry called for by the shadow minister for climate action, environment and heritage, the member for Flinders, is needed. The government, however, does not learn by its mistakes; it is a repeat offender. Just look at the reckless spending on settop boxes. The cost of each one is now estimated to average $698, which is almost double the government's original estimate and more than the cost of a digital TV with a 106 centimetre screen. The set-top box program is so hard for pensioners to access that they often give up and themselves pay $100-a sum which includes installation-for a set-top box. We also know that the government has spent nearly $1 million on legal bills so far for the alleged corruption investigation into the member for Dobell. This Labor government, as we have seen this past week, is far more interested in its own survival than it is in the welfare of the Australian people. That is an indictment of it, and it is its legacy. This Labor government will be remembered for all the wrong reasons well into the future. Let us look more closely at the appropriations in these bills. According to the government's own latest estimates, there has been an additional budget blowout in asylum seeker costs of $866 million. As a result, the government has come back to this parliament to seek an immediate appropriation of $330 million to cover the shortfall in last year's costs and the expected increase for this year. On top of this, the government is asking for an extra $759 million over the four years from 2014-15. In 2011-12, the immigration budget will cost Australian taxpayers $2.73 billion. That is $1 billion more than the $1.69 million it cost in 2007-08. This stands as a towering monument to the incompetence of the Gillard government, whose failure has to be subsidised by working Australians. In many cases these working Australians, who are underwriting Labor's failures, are the very people-those aspirational Australians-who are under attack by the Gillard government for working hard to support themselves. Average working families on standard incomes are being hit again and again to subsidise Labor's waste. They were hit by the baby bonus means test and by the family tax benefit means test, and they will be hit by the carbon tax ahead of us-all of which the Labor government promised was never going to happen. 'Trust us,' the government has said before each election. The government will also hit hard working Australians with their private health insurance costs, and I am waiting to see what will happen with private school costs. The small business sector in my electorate and across Australia is in the direct firing line of the government. Given the over 12½ thousand pieces of legislation introduced by the government, small businesses are virtually being red-taped into bankruptcy. Small businesses are doing it tough-we know there are, I think, 10,000 fewer than last year. And the South West is no exception. This would probably come as no surprise to members on our side of the House, who maintain very close relationships with their small business operators, but it must be news to the government or they would be acting to ease the burden on small businesses, which are the foundation of the Australian economy and employ millions of Australian workers. The coalition take their issues very, very seriously, and we have formed our own committee to examine the impact of government regulation on the small business sector. During a recent walk through central Bunbury to talk to business owners in my electorate, I met several who were having to close their doors. These people should have been able to concentrate on their businesses, on making a profit to be able to employ people, instead of having to concentrate on government red tape. Let me turn to what would be an appropriate expenditure that could have been addressed by the bills before the House, in the expenditure, had the government not wasted billions and billions of dollars. There are so many good projects out there that could and should be funded, and now is a prime opportunity to invest in the infrastructure needs of the South West. Such investment would not only secure the economic future of the region but would ensure good planning and social outcomes. Of particular importance is the transport infrastructure that is needed in the region and which I have raised repeatedly in this House. The billion-dollar blow-out in border protection alone-one of those billions-would have funded the infrastructure needs of the South West for a generation, including the delivery of the vital Roads to Export plan. The region is a major exporter of alumina and mineral sands products. It will become a major coal exporter-but only with adequate investment in transport, as identified in my own infrastructure plan and in the Roads to Export plan developed by the South West Development Commission, the South West regional development authority and the Bunbury Wellington Economic Alliance. The region will also only maintain and expand its tourism status with investment in safer roads, additional rail and a genuine regional airport able to take larger aircraft with the possibility of direct interstate flights. The Capes region has been identified as a prime location for a larger regional airport, and it would be a visionary investment in the South West. These are some of the projects that could be funded through the waste of Labor's spending. After a two-year campaign to fix what was a disgraceful, independent-youth-allowance form of discrimination, which the Labor government arbitrarily inflicted on students and their families, the government was forced to change their rules-only to treat those same students badly again. The untrustworthy government told the Australian community that they would end the discrimination, but basically there is a parental means test for students seeking independent youth allowance. These are the students who already have to face anything from $15,000 to $30,000 a year more in costs just to go to school, just to go to university in a city, and these are costs that metropolitan and urban students do not have to find. For those outerregional students, it is the first time that this means test has been applied, and it is just another attack on working families in my part of the world, in rural and regional Australia. It took a two-year campaign to end the appalling discrimination that we saw with youth allowance. What was even worse in this one was the number of young people who actually changed the courses they were taking while this was in place because they knew their families could not afford to send them on to university. Two years ago I raised in the House the threat posed to the environment in my part of the world by phytophthora dieback. I have been disappointed by the lack of government action on this looming biodiversity disaster. Last year an update on the impact of dieback was given to the Committee for Climate Change, Environment and the Arts, which I hope will provide some greater impetus for the government to take action. The need to manage this insidious disease cannot be overstated, and I am seeking a far greater effort. I want to see a detailed, comprehensive map, including the South-West Land Division, assembled as quickly as possible. We need to know exactly where dieback is and where it is not on both state-held and private land. Following the comprehensive mapping of dieback, we must develop a planning and management toolbox that tells all landholders how to manage and reduce the spread of dieback in their specific areas. We also need to join the international science community and invest in research to find newer and better control mechanisms, including a treatment that can eliminate dieback from infected plants. These are just some of the programs that could have been funded simply with the waste that we have seen generated by this Labor government. Ahead, particularly for small business, is the issue of the carbon tax. In spite of what has been said, there are many small businesses who, for many reasons, do not have the capacity to pass on the additional cost of a carbon tax. There are farmers who fit into this category. Dairy farmers are absolute price-takers. They have to cool millions and millions of litres of milk every year, and they are going to have to bear the cost of the carbon tax. I would like to see whether the major supermarkets are planning to pass on any additional return or price to the dairy farmers who are supplying them with milk, because they are having to meet the additional cost of cooling the milk as a result of the additional cost of electricity, which will be at least 10 per cent-I would say even more. When transport, including that run on diesel, becomes part of this equation, as we know it will in 2014, the cost of the carbon tax is going to be far greater and certainly more than was projected for farmers and people living in rural and regional areas. We know how far loads are carted around Australia and we know the size of the freight task. So this tax is going to impact on small communities right around Australia, particularly those in my electorate. It is going to impact directly on small business. A whole raft of businesses are really concerned. They do not have confidence right at this moment. They do not have confidence in the policies of this government. They do not have the confidence to invest in themselves into the future. They do not have the confidence to continue employing people. Last week I and other people from a range of businesses attended a meeting of transport operators, earthmoving operators and those involved in servicing that sector in my electorate. There was an incredible level of uncertainty and concern there. There was uncertainty around the carbon tax and the liability facing their businesses. They will have to either buy the expertise or employ people just to deal with this issue, to run the ruler over their businesses and to see what this tax is going to cost them, what their liability might be and how their businesses are going to manage going forward. So there is a lot more ahead for small to medium enterprises as a result of the carbon tax. As I said, the appalling thing for people right around Australia and particularly for those in my electorate is the untold waste and mismanagement. I am sure every member would be able to identify many other purposes for that waste. We would have far less debt if there had not been the waste that we have seen from this government. The lack of confidence right around this nation is a result of the decisions made by this government. to concentrate on the need for agricultural skills now and particularly in the future. Two weeks ago we learnt that the University of Western Sydney will, for the first time in 100 years, no longer offer a degree in agriculture at its Hawkesbury campus. With fewer than 10 enrolments for 2012, the course is not viable and the university has been forced to suspend it. According to reports, the number of campuses offering degrees in agriculture in 1989 was 23 and the number now, I believe, is around nine or possibly 10. Further investigations have also revealed that fewer than 700 agricultural science students will graduate nationally this year. The amazing thing is that every one of them can get a job whether through corporate agriculture, commercial positions in agribusiness or working for government. Mind you, governments, particularly state governments, are employing fewer and fewer people. This government actually cut its graduate program at one point-until public outcry forced them to stop that. We need agricultural scientists. We need researchers from the point of view of biosecurity and quarantine. There is nothing agriculture needs in the future so much as those people with the ability to scientifically protect it or have the knowledge and the experience to scientifically protect it from the biosecurity angle. This is for two reasons. One, the greatest selling point that Australian agriculture has is our virtual disease-free situation. We are lucky enough to be the world's largest island continent. But it is not just that. It is also because we need to protect ourselves from those things which enter the country as well as those things which leave it. The only thing that has kept agriculture out there over the last 40 to 50 years has been the increases in productivity it is able to generate. Up until about eight or nine years ago it had an annual growth rate of something over three per cent, which is phenomenal and probably greater than anything any of the developed nations of the world have ever had. In the last few years it has plateaued out, not just because of drought. In recent times we have had a far greater influx of bio-issues for our departments to worry about. The truth is that state governments have to a large extent abdicated their responsibility. More and more this is an issue that the federal government has to deal with-but not this one. It is not dealing with it. Degrees and courses in agriculture are imperative, particularly in research. We have to start encouraging this, whether through scholarships or whatever it might be. We have to work",207,Wyatt Roy Longman 16 15 The Australian Society That I Believe In Is A Society
201,Mr John Cobb (Calare) (17:43,"In speaking on appropriation bills Nos3 and 4, I wantwith industry to increase the number of people doing ag science and postgraduate research. There is a lot a federal government can do with the state governments. We have to get them back in the game. However, this does seem increasingly unlikely with the current federal government's inherent ignorance of all things agricultural. I hesitate to say that they have a down on agriculture. I think it is just total carelessness. Their knowledge of things commercial and things which agriculture actually needs is quite staggering. Some of them are so careless you would think that they could not do it on purpose-it is just ignorance. But the list is growing-biosecurity incursions which have not been dealt with, myrtle rust and the Asian honeybee. There is a lack of transparency on foreign ownership. And, on the live cattle ban, not one action taken by this government has frightened Australian business, be it corporate or small business-they could sell razor blades, face creams or steel-like the overnight ban on the live trade to Indonesia, without talking to the customers. If they can do that to something which cannot be stuck on the shelf for six months until it is convenient to sell, what the heck would they do to something that can be stuck on the shelf for six months? Not one action frightened Australian business so much as that, let alone the offhand way in which they dealt with the country in question. The passing of the carbon tax-I do not know whether it is ignorance or whether they realise what they are doing-will have a greater effect on agriculture than on almost any other business, even though they say we are not involved in it. Everything we do is involved with the carbon tax effect-it is on everything we buy or transport or whatever. Also, the comments by both the current minister and the previous minister about how the milk price war would not do any harm to anyone and was good for consumers show total and careless ignorance about how the market system works and how dairy farmers are affected by this, and dairy farmers will be very much affected by the carbon tax. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan failed to deliver an environmental water plan that shows how they will achieve the environmental outcomes. They have decided they have to take all this water from productive outcomes. You may say, 'By God, that must have taken a while,' but it took just 12 months for all those things to happen. Two weeks ago we learnt that the department had changed its mission statement. The mission statement used to say the things you would expect a specific department within government to do: talk about agriculture, its needs, its aspirations, its need for trade, its need for good practices et cetera. Now it says: We work to sustain the way of life and prosperity of all Australians. Well, hooray, that is what every government should say. But for a specific department to remove any reference to its reason for existence does make you wonder. What hope does agriculture have when even the government and a specialised department are turning their backs on it, are totally deaf to its needs and are not even aware that that is what they are doing? Agriculture in Australia drives $155 billion a year in economic production. It is over 12 per cent of the GDP. We might not ride on the back of it any more, but by heavens we contribute to it. It generates around 1.6 million Australian jobs and $32 billion a year in exports. That is in farm exports. They are creating-along with the small business sector in Australia, in particular-a genuine lack of confidence. This is terribly sad because this should be a challenging and exciting time for agriculture. In the last 8 years particularly, the UN and everyone else truthfully says that commodity and agriculture prices have risen. It is not because we have gone from six billion to seven billion in 11 years. That is part of the reason, but it is not the big reason. They are not saying the future is great because they are talking about nine billion in the next 20 or 30 years or so. They may be reasons. But the real reason is that in the past 20 years our nearest neighbours, Asia and South-East Asia, have developed a very significant improvement in lifestyle by middle income earners, whether it is Indonesia, China, India or whatever. Previously, when we have had a lift out of Asia it was caused by Japan or Korea. The actual lift in possible market gain by China, India and Indonesia is probably something like 15 times as strong as what is already happening in Japan and Korea. It is not because of the size of the populations. It is because they are getting used to the meat that weA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 17:54 to 18:02 Farmer-and I hope this current government, with its renewed Prime Minister, as it were, can start to grasp that this is the Australian Year of the Farmer-the whole of Australia does not need to worship farmers, or try to set farmers on a pedestal, because they do not want that. But agriculture does need the people of Australia to realise that it is not just a matter of going out there, putting something in the ground and, by and by, selling it. It is enormously difficult to be a farmer, having to meet what our nation deserves and expects in the name of quality, in the name of biosecurity, in the name of food safety, in the name of productivity. We do need an agricultural sector that can continue not just to meet our expectations. The fact is that we set a benchmark in the world's exports not just for quality and not just for our products being virtually disease free. The fact is that, while we are nowhere near one of the world's biggest producers, we are number 4 in the world's largest exporters of agricultural commodities. That is because we are only 20-odd million people but we grow three or four times as much as we need ourselves. We are not in any way, shape or form going to run out of food, but we have to make sure we continue to produce what we do. We need to set a benchmark around the world so that those with the necessary degrees, with the necessary research capabilities and with the necessary abilities can continue to help farmers grow more with the same or less moisture on the same soil as they had before. We can only do this if we have not fewer graduates from university but more. One of the great things that corporate agriculture does in Australia is employ a lot of these people. The family farms perfect what the larger corporations do, but we still need those with the resources to try them. They also employ those who have the ability to come up with new products and new ideas. This government must be cognisant of the fact that it has totally ignored-as much carelessly as deliberately-the needs of agriculture. In the three years that I have been responsible in the coalition for agriculture, I think I have had the head of every faculty in Australia that has run an agricultural course say to me that they need more encouragement, particularly from the federal government, including encouragement for young people to enter agricultural science and the like through the universities and further education that Australia has to offer. Agriculture has an enormous amount to offer the country and the world, but it needs the right people in the right place to do it. It needs this government to act. We are committed to",214,Wyatt Roy Longman 16 15 The Australian Society That I Believe In Is A Society
202,Mr John Cobb,"Government rolls on. I think that in the Australian Year of theencouraging students and encouraging R&D. This government has cut the personnel involved with biosecurity and quarantine. It has cut the money available. It has taken out a whole department from the area. This is incredibly dangerous. Nothing makes me as nervous as this government's attitude to quarantine and biosecurity. (Time expired) Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (18:06): Defence have a record of getting things wrong and attacking detractors who tend to be accurate with data. Defence needs comprehensive reform and needs a defence minister with the guts to take it on. Unfortunately, of late-and I am not just talking about this government-we have not had defence ministers who have done this. When I was in the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, we would continually hear from Defence, when we were looking at projects, that they accepted that things had been awry six or 12 months in the past but that things were hunky-dory now. Then we would find, six months or 12 months later, that in fact things were not hunky-dory. The excuse would always be 'complex systems management'. Look at some of the gas trains in the north-west, for instance-they involve complex management, and yet they manage to get things right. Look at how quickly the motor industry manage to get a new car up and going without having a huge amount of problems at the outset. They are quite complex pieces of equipment. I will go to the Joint Strike Fighter as a case example. First of all, let's have a look at the history of costs associated with this program and test how accurate Defence has been. The best estimate by the United States Air Force as of last year for the average procurement cost of a Joint Strike Fighter was $133 million. Defence have stated in the past that, as they will be buying early in the cycle, theirs will cost about 10 per cent more, so about $146 million. In fact, the Selected Acquisition Reports say that the cost will be about $154 million per JSF, which in the Australian context means about $170 million. Just to reiterate, USAF says $146 million; the Selected Acquisition Reports say about $170 million. Now let's have a look at Defence's history on this. In 2005, Defence said that the so-called 'unit recurring flyaway cost' would be about $50 million, while the USAF at the same time said that it would be around $80 million. So, really, in the Australian context at that time, it should have been $88 million. Defence were out almost by a factor of two. A group called Air Power Australia said in 2006 the procurement price would be $165 million per aircraft. In 2009 Defence talked about $70 million unit recurring flyaway cost when the United States Air Force, using the same measure for what is called 'low rate initial production batch 6', had $117 million per. APA now estimates that in the acquisition they will probably cost around $215 million each. They do have various allowances, plus and minus, in their figures. As can be seen, Defence have been third rate in their costing estimates compared with Air Power Australia. Remember that Defence are supposed to have access to all of this good information directly from Lockheed Martin and that they have people in Washington DC working with the United States Air Force and congress. They have been hopeless with their costings. They have been third rate in their costings, but they have claimed that in fact they knew the true price. When you think about that, if they did know, then they have chosen to mislead parliament by what they have said. Let us have a look at schedule. When are we going to get these Joint Strike Fighters? In 2005 Defence said that they would achieve what is called 'initial operational capability' in 2012-13-in other words, this year. In 2006, the year later, Air Power Australia said that IOC would occur in around 2020. In 2007, the year after APA was saying 2020, Defence said it would be around 2014-15. In fact in 2008, the then head of the Defence Material Organisation, Stephen Gumley, said on schedule: 'It is not something I lose much sleep about.' That is a real worry. In 2011 Defence said that initial operation capability would be in late 2018. Remember it was only back in 2005 that they were saying it would be in 2012-13. Once again, it was a dud projection. We are supposed to believe their assurances when, by their own definition, with a 10 per cent increase in costs and a risk management matrix used by DMO being almost certain-in fact in this case it has eventuated, and then some-you have extreme risk. That is their own definition: extreme risk. The schedule has slipped by six years, from 2012 to 2018, and Defence says that that 12-month slippage is 'extreme risk'. Yet they are blithely going on as if there is no problem in the world with this. There are dud predictions wherever you look, but we are supposed to take Defence's word at face value and trust them. The problem is that they have actually acted as Lockheed Martin's salespeople and simply accepted their assertions on cost, schedule and capability. Where is the supposed role of Defence acting with due diligence and accepting caveat emptor? With the JSF program in the United States, just in the last 12 months the director of operational test and evaluation has written a damning report on the Joint Strike Fighter. Similarly, a quick look review which was conducted was similarly damaging in its assessment. But Defence seem to be as happy with this program as pigs in mud. Due to the Super Hornet purchase, this dud decision to purchase the Joint Strike Fighter has already cost us billions. By Chief of Air Force's own optimistic admission, the Super Hornet will be overmatched in the region by 2025, yet this is Defence's plan B. I recall discussing this in committee with DMO head Stephen Gumley. He said about the schedule slip with the JSF, 'It hasn't cost us anything', forgetting about the opportunity cost associated with the Super Hornet. We would not have needed the Super Hornet if the Joint Strike Fighter had arrived on schedule. The problem is that, apart from cost increases and schedule slippages, Defence has given us no idea whatsoever. Where they would say, 'Hang on. This now is unacceptable and this is something we shouldn't proceed with', they were assuring us that capability is good; whereas analysis that I have seen, having looked at the data myself, this capability is certainly nowhere near what it should be. Similarly, when looking at another Defence acquisition debacle, the Super Seasprite, you have a waste of over $1 billion. This helicopter ended up being scrapped. They had numerous warnings, notably again from Air Power Australia, from 1998 that they had to spend 20 per cent to 25 per cent of acquisition budget on test and evaluation or else abandon the project. The project was very, very risky and this was deemed to be the level of spending required. Defence ignored the advice and carried on for around 10 years on this project and, as I said, it was scrapped. If the advice had been heeded there would have been over $1 billion in savings. How do Defence treat those with expertise who give good and timely advice? In the case of Air Power Australia's Peter Goon and his company Australian Flight Test Services the answer is to blacklist the company. This has been confirmed by retired Air Commodore Garry Bates, who similarly, along with the likes of Air Vice Marshal Peter Crisp, have felt the ire of the Defence hierarchy for daring to question. In the case of Australia Flight Test Services the Blunn review said that they must be paid for the work that has been done. Years later this has still not been paid, as Defence are wanting non-related issues signed away by Australian Flight Test Services before they will pay them. This is an unconscionable action. Defence should engage their critics professionally and thereby save a lot of money for a small outlay. Instead, they state that they will not professionally interact with, for example, Air Power Australia, despite their clear historical superiority to Defence in costing and schedule at the very least. Defence have similarly acted negatively towards RepSim, despite Mike Price, one of their principals, having been written a commendation by General David Hurley, now Chief of Defence Force, for simulation work that they have done. RepSim similarly have dared to question the Defence line, showing that the joint strike fighter will be shot down at a rate of three to one by Russian designed Super-Flankers, and this is not even the Russians latest design. We have also seen a problem with communications within Defence-for instance, with night vision goggles. When I went to Afghanistan and also when the committee met with the commandos, they stated that their night vision equipment was outdated and they needed more up-to-date gear. Yet the Chief of Army, when he spoke to the committee, was unaware of any concerns. We find similarly that the DLA Piper review that was similarly supposed to look at abuses in and by Defence seems to be used as a cover-up mechanism rather than as a mean to transparency. I know of two cases of abuse, and I registered with DLA Piper, yet they ignored me in my role as a federal MP letting them know of abuses with prejudice. How much more would they ignore others with prejudice who are not MPs? Indeed, there was a little rudeness in my dealings with them, and I am aware of far worse with others. So much for Defence wanting to clean up their act. The problem was highlighted by ex-Chief of Air Force and exChief of Defence Force, Angus Houston, who stated: I cannot and will not do anything that would cause embarrassment to former and present senior Defence portfolio officials. Causing embarrassment to senior officials as opposed to getting good acquisitions, good capabilities for our men and women who are out fighting in war zones at the moment! Defence needs to put feedback loops into their organisation and engage professionally with those with demonstrated expertise as a matter of urgency. It is interesting that in a report from the Australian National Audit Office in 1998 they were talking about life cycle costing. The report said: Defence policy has been set for life cycle costing for some time, but there appears to be little toplevel enforcement or encouragement at present for the use of LCC throughout the acquisition life cycle. There are also few incentives for the middle management to adopt life cycle costing principles by making investments now to save operating costs later. We are now 14 years past this and nothing has improved-in fact, if anything it has got worse. Defence really need to clean up their act. They need to reform. They need to put processes in place whereby they can interact with those out in industry who do have the expertise required. The security of Australia and the lives of our troops, our sailors and our airmen depend on it. 4. These are important bills relating to the management of our nation's economy. It is through appropriations bills that we the legislators and decision makers elected by the Australian",216,Wyatt Roy Longman 16 15 The Australian Society That I Believe In Is A Society
203,Mr Alexander (Bennelong) (18:20,"I rise to speak on appropriation bills Nos. 3 andpeople establish how we want our nation's finances to be spent. This is the vehicle to tell our nation what our priorities are and what kind of legacy we want to leave for future generations. From the views I hear from my constituents and from what I see as their representative, this legacy is becoming an increasingly poor one. Program after program of waste is implemented by this government as the policies that we really need are left on the sidelines in the too-hardbasket, and we all suffer. This is a modern-day version of Nero fiddling while Rome burns. Earlier today in question time the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport referred to our nation's 'infrastructure deficit'. As the member for Bennelong I am keenly aware of this issue and I have spoken many times in this place about the need for urgent attention to fix this disease. With five of the 10 most congested roads in New South Wales, made worse by the community's total dependence on buses as their only source of public transport, this infrastructure deficit is having a major effect on our local community. Average speeds of under 10 kilometres per hour during peak hours mean that our nation's productivity is squashed and that the important time for mums and dads to have with their loved ones is thoroughly impacted. The other major infrastructure concern that has threatened my local community is the inappropriate development of high-density housing in suburban areas ill-equipped to deal with this increase in the local population. This concentration of people in areas without access to public transport or local shopping facilities only further exacerbates the problem of congestion on roads as families are forced into the car just to buy their groceries or other daily items, making it even harder to find an end to this worsening nightmare-after all, it is pretty difficult to put out the fire when more fuel is being continually added. These high-density planning decisions were forced upon the local community by previous state governments, using part 3A powers under the New South Wales Environmental Planning and Assessment Act. This gave the planning department and the state government two centralised authorities with little understanding of the local needs and capability of the local area the power to overrule decisions made by local government to prevent inappropriate development. During the 2010 election campaign, I campaigned loudly and strongly on this issue, visiting example after example of totally unsuitable high-density residential blocks being built in tiny streets with no parking and no access to transport or shops. I joined with local councillors and state opposition MPs and marched down these streets and called on the New South Wales Labor government to let the local government do their job and to put the same faith in the local representatives that the people do to make the best decisions in the interests of the local community. It was clear for all to see that intervention from state and federal authorities over decisions of the local council representing the wishes of the local community was unacceptable, improper and simply bad policy. It was undemocratic. In March last year, this campaign climaxed as Barry O'Farrell was swept into power. His first act was to get rid of part 3A and to put planning decisions back into local hands. I look back with great pride at this campaign because it was a perfect example of people power, of the will of the people being represented and of the trust in the local representatives. Recently this issue manifested itself in the proposed redevelopment of the Ryde Civic Centre, a decrepit seven-story building perched on a key intersection directly opposite the massive and magnificent Top Ryde City Shopping Centre. The current building was once an icon in the local area but, like what happens to the best of us, age has taken its toll. An amount of $700,000 has recently been approved to ensure a reliable power supply and council has estimated that a further $12.5 million will be needed just to maintain the current structure over the next five years. And so, since 1995, discussions have taken place about ideas of redeveloping the site, of bringing the seat of local government into the 21st century, of a structure that will have room for all council employees to be housed in one building and of a new icon for our local region. Of course, such development ideas do not proceed without tension. Despite elected representatives from both Labor and Liberal joining together to promote the idea, a local action group has been formed to oppose the redevelopment of this site. This is democracy in action, as concerned members of our community have attended council meetings and participated in real grassroots politics. For someone who is too often stuck in somewhat surreal disconnected halls of Canberra it is very fulfilling to hear the stories of real democracy in action. Aside from any individuals latched onto disgruntled voters as a way to pursue their own personal political ambitions, I offer my support to all those residents with genuine local concerns who wish their voices to be heard and who wish to participate in this democratic process. This is not a partisan issue, as elected representatives from both parties have supported this development. It is a political issue, wrapped up in a bigger question about the future needs of our local Ryde community and how we want to get there. I remain strong in my view, just like I was during the 2010 campaign, that these local development issues are the domain of the local council. It would be inappropriate for me to become vocal on one side or another, just as it was for the previous state government to become involved by overruling local planning decisions. Yet these planning decisions affect my local constituents and me personally as a Ryde council ratepayer. SoI have taken an active interest in being across the issues, speaking with local government representatives from both sides of the argument, including holding a 2½ hour meeting in my office with the council general manager and development director. During this meeting I pressed the need and sought assurances for a rigorous and transparent community consultation process, ensuring that all proper planning procedures are followed and that it remains in line with local environment protocols, unanimously supported by all local counsellors. Whilst some redevelopment design possibilities have been tossed around, I understand that it will be up to the private developer to propose and the local council to approve the final design, shape and appearance of the structure. I have faith that the local representatives will be making these decisions in the best interests of the community and will fully respect the local amenity. The philosophical approach to this concept that I do support, whether it be in Ryde, Epping, Macquarie Park or Eastwood, is that the focus of residential development should be around major shopping centres and bus terminals. By giving people the ability to travel to their work and perform their shopping duties without the need to take a car is a huge priority that deserves our support. So much of this local region has been destroyed through the demolition of street after street of suburban residential homes to build five-storey apartments, with no concept of supporting infrastructure. I personally experienced this several years ago, when my family home was gobbled up by developers, who gave us two choices: either sell to us or lose the value of your property because you will be next to apartments on all sides. As an elected representative it is my duty and my goal to help my constituents avoid the need to personally endure such a distressing experience. The way to do this is through proper planning, ensuring there is logic, as well as supporting infrastructure, surrounding the decision to build higher density living. Planning is not what happens when a problem is overtaking a situation of our own making, when growth outpaces infrastructure. Good planning and timely commitment to appropriate infrastructure would in fact prevent such a situation occurring. Across my local community and across the nation we see examples where, time and again, this has not happened. As a result our cities suffer from either a serious infrastructure deficit, whose solution requires a multiple spend to rectify through retroactive installation, or an excessively high cost of living, which combine to destroy our productivity, competitiveness and quality of life. It is a confounding situation that we find ourselves in a country where our single biggest asset is land, yet through these oversights we have produced, to our detriment, the most expensive cities in the world to buy real estate. It may be uncomfortable to come to termsDebate interrupted. Australian Year of the Farmer Debate resumed on motion by Mr Scott: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) the Australian Year of the Farmer 2012 provides an opportunity to celebrate such achievements and to further strengthen the connections between rural and urban Australia; (b) Australian farming families play a vital role in our society and it is important that we all recognise how much farming affects our lives; (c) Australian farmers have a central role in delivering domestic and global food security; (d) Australian farming families and the associated agricultural industries are involved in producing, processing, handling and selling products from 136,000 farms across the country; and (e) Australian farms and the industries that support them generate more than $405 billion each year; and (2) calls on members of the House to recognise: (a) the Australian Year of the Farmer and the vital role that Australian farming families and their associated agricultural industries play in keeping our nation fed, clothed and sheltered; and (b) the significant contribution that Australian agriculture makes to the nation's economy. Deputy Speaker, in this, the Federation Chamber, as it is officially now. What an appropriate place the Federation Chamber is to speak on this year being designated the Australian Year of the Farmer since, long before Federation, farmers across this nation were feeding our population and also contributing to many other countries who needed food from Australia, clean and green as it is. This is going to be a year-long celebration of the vital role farmers play in feeding, clothing and housing all Australians. It will really give us an opportunity to celebrate these achievements. At the same time, it is important that we strengthen the",219,Wyatt Roy Longman 16 15 The Australian Society That I Believe In Is A Society
204,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa,"Second Deputy Speaker) (18:30): Thank you, Madamconnection between rural and city folk across this nation. Getting those connections is also an important element of celebrating the Australian Year of the Farmer. This motion, and the Australian Year of the Farmer, recognises the important role that farmers play in our food and fibre production. Our city cousins-and people in our regional towns, for that matter-go down to the supermarket or the local store and buy their food, and we want them to connect to the role that farmers play in providing that produce and to get the connection between the paddock and the plate. Not only is it important for our city cousins and those in larger regional areas, but it is also important that children at school during this celebration year of the farmer gain an understanding of where our food comes from. Food does not just come off the supermarket shelf; it has an origin. As we work through this year celebrating the farmer it is important that we are able to get that connection across not only to our city cousins but also to schools across this country. Australian agricultural products and related industries inject more than $405 billion into our national economy. Australian farmers provide food for some 60 million people both in Australia and around the world each and every day. They provide food for 22 million people in Australia, and 98 per cent of our food in Australia is provided by Australian farmers. The rest of it is of course exported. The sector provides direct employment for more than 300,000 people in our nation who live and work in regional and rural Australia. But the complete agricultural supply chain, including the affiliated food and fibre industries, provides jobs for some 1.6 million Australians. That is a vital part of our national economy. In fact, one in six working people work in the agricultural, food or fibre industry in Australia. The former Prime Minister and members of the government might say that they saved us from going into recession during the global financial crisis. But whilst there were initiatives taken by the government, which I acknowledged at the time, the agricultural sector continued to grow during that very tight economic circumstance of the global financial crisis. We had one quarter of deficit growth. In the quarter after that we were saved from going into a technical recession because the agricultural sector continued to grow. That is another reason to celebrate the importance of our farmers and our food producers across this nation. Both within and beyond our borders, Australian farmers are making a significant contribution to addressing the global food security and supply issues. When we sit down at the dinner table tonight, and around the world as families sit down around their dinner tables tonight, there will be another 240,000 mouths to feed. There will be another 240,000 mouths to feed tomorrow night. What that means is that this calendar year there will be another 40 million people-net population growth-globally. We have got to start to focus on this issue of global food security. There will be another 240,000 mouths to be fed in the world today, and another 40 million this year-that is the net number-and these are figures that have come from the OECD and the United Nations. The population is expected, globally, to grow from the current 6.5 billion to some nine billion by 2050. Of course, the other interesting thing is that the United Nations is predicting there will be a 40 per cent rise in food prices by 2020 because, as the squeeze starts to come on, supply-demand factors will come in. So not only are we celebrating this year, the year of the farmer, but there are great challenges ahead for us and our farming communities as well as for government. I think it was the CSIRO who stated, and the UN has also stated, that in the next 40 years we have got to produce 50 per cent more food than we produce today if we are to meet this challenge. And that is against the backdrop of those countries where there are huge population bubbles, where the soil types have been farmed since before the birth of Christ. They are old-ancient-soils. They have lost lots of their organic matter. Many are in semi-arid or desert areas. And do they have a capacity to increase food production? The challenge is before us all. I want, as a Nuffield scholar myself, to acknowledge the great role that the Australian Nuffield farming scholarships have played in the Australian agricultural industries. This year there will be some 21 Australian Nuffield scholars travelling overseas and looking at agriculture and the focus on agriculture globally, not just in our own backyard. I have two from my own constituency going this year: James Walker from Longreach and Natalie Williams from Jericho. Andrew Dewar is from Clifton in the east of my electorate; a vegetable producer, he is completing his scholarship which he was awarded last year. Nuffield is making a significant contribution to giving farmers an opportunity to study overseas, to look at the trends overseas, to gain an understanding of the great challenges ahead, and I know that all of those Nuffield scholars who come back will be able to take up the challenge that is before us. I commend Lord Nuffield for the foundation he established so long ago, and I am very privileged to have been one of the recipients of a Nuffield scholarship prior to coming into this place. I wish them all well and I know they will make a difference. One of the things that we have got to do in this country is to increase R&D funding. What we have seen under this government is a reduction in R&D funding, and that is not what we should be doing, because R&D will indeed give us an opportunity to progress our agricultural production. It is also about developing new varieties, making sure that we can produce food in the era of potential changes to our climate. So R&D is indeed essential as we go into the next 40 to 50 years with this huge global challenge in front of us. I want to touch just quickly on the families of my electorate of Maranoa. In fact, 22 per cent of the workforce in Maranoa, based on the 2006 Census figures-it would have changed recently with the resource sector-had worked in the agricultural sector. A quarter of the state's beef and cattle enterprises are located in the electorate of Maranoa. My own home town of Roma boasts the largest store cattle selling centre in Australia-sometimes they tell me it is 'in the southern hemisphere' but I will say 'in Australia' here. Much of the Australian sheep industry and the wool industry is based in my electorate. Meat goats are taking a much bigger place in the Charleville abattoir in western Queensland, which is processing up to 15,000 goats per week, and goat meat has the largest percentage of meat consumed of any of the meats in the world. Goat meat is the most popular in the world, and 15,000 of goats are processed in the electorate of Maranoa each and every year. There is cotton production across the Darling Downs and Dirranbandi and border regions. We have barley, of course essential in beer production, which I noticed would interest many of my colleagues. Around Dalby in my electorate we have sorghum, which is also being converted into ethanol. All the feedstock from that goes into an intensive animal-livestock feeding industry. We have fruit and small crops in the east of the electorate. Something like 10 per cent of Queensland's avocados are produced in the electorate. The story goes on. In fact, 95 per cent of Queensland's apples are produced in the electorate of Maranoa. I commend all members of this House to talk about this throughout the year. This is the Australian Year of the Farmer. I commend the directors, Chairman Philip Bruem and the Managing Director Geoff Bell. I also acknowledge Glen McGrath who is the ambassador and Her Excellency the Governor General Quentin Bryce. This is a year to join together to celebrate the Australian Year of the Farmer. (Time expired) Maranoa, Bruce Scott, in recognising the vital contribution that farmers around Australia make to our society, to our economy and to our way of life. To celebrate Australian farmers for the 2012 calendar year is testament to the valuable contribution that farmers make. Without farmers, Australia would not experience the wonderful standard of living with quality, fresh locally-grown produce that we enjoy. Farmers provide us with so many quality items: fresh vegetables, meat, dairy, grain, wool, eggs, fish, cotton and timber items. I feel that all too often people consume their meals without a thought for those tireless workersthe farmers-who work the land to grow and harvest the wonderful produce that we find on supermarket shelves, in fruit and vegetable shops and in the butcher shops. I recently had the pleasure of welcoming the federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator the Hon. Joe Ludwig, the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and member for Braddon, Sid Sidebottom, and the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry and member for Lyons, the Hon. Dick Adams, to my electorate for a tour of the north-east region of the state. This area is prime farmland, home to numerous dairies and cropping farms. The group toured the north-east, visiting the Headquarters Road Dam, the Razz Rhubarb farm and Bridestowe lavender farm. The fantastic potential of the north-east of Tasmania is largely due to, and certainly to be improved on, the four irrigation projects that we discussed-one being the finished Headquarters Road dam and another that is near completion. Another topic of discussion was the Scottsdale DSTO joining the CSIRO and the University of Tasmania to value-add to the products being produced in the north-east. I was particularly impressed to see the joint venture between Razz Rhubarb and Bridestowe Lavender Estate to produce lavender and rhubarb jam-an example of the innovation and creativity of the farming region. Razz Rhubarb is run by Jerrod Nichols, the son of Maureen, former manager of North East Soldiers Memorial Hospital in Scottsdale. He is an impressive, innovative representative of farming in my electorate of Bass. Jerrod farms rhubarb along with other products, including squash, poppies, potatoes and pyrethrum. He has wonderful fresh products and by working with the Bridestowe lavender farm is creating other avenues for using rhubarb, including lavender and rhubarb jam. Another product produced in the north-east is Rhu Bru, the most refreshing of drinks. If you have not had Rhu Bru you are really missing out. It is a great drink-fantastic. You should go to Scottsdale and buy some Rhu Bru. Jerrod is keen to promote quality Tasmanian products not only to the nation but also to export markets. He has a great vision and one that needs to be further encouraged to promote the great Tasmanian produce. He places great emphasis on the importance of fresh produce, not cheaply imported canned or frozen products. I was pleased to bring the minister, the parliamentary secretary and the chair of the committee to this electorate for them to witness first hand the high level of innovation and potential that the region has. With good soils, reliable rainfall and available water, there is great potential for further development in this region. Farmers have always been innovators and adaptors of new technology and have had to, and are willing to continue to, endure the",222,Private Members Business
205,Mr Lyons (Bass) (18:40,"I rise tonight to support the motion of the member forharsh and unpredictable elements that Mother Nature throws at them. Farmers endure all of the elements-droughts, floods and fires-and more of these elements can result in bumper crops or massive heart breaking devastation. But farming life goes on, and it is at times like these, when you see the farming communities rally together to beat adversity, that you note the terrific community spirit in these communities that pulls them together. It is a terrific example of the mateship that is so often referred to as being an important element of Australian society. It is a pity that manufacturing and processing of produce is now almost exclusively controlled internationally, resulting in farmers becoming price takers with little bargaining power in the selling of their produce. This does not lead to efficiency, nor does it allow for improved quality of products. The trouble is that the international processors tend to go for price rather than quality, which can affect farmers and put them in a difficult economic position. To help rectify this and to support Aussie farmers, I encourage all Australians to buy locally, to buy Australian products, because if we do not there will not be Australian farmers of our fresh local produce that we all enjoy so very much. We are beginning to see too many cheap vegetable imports. Australians need to ensure that when they are purchasing items from their supermarket they are purchasing Australian-grown products, not those from our overseas counterparts. Even though they may be cheaper in price, we do need to buy locally and we do need to encourage others to buy locally. We need to educate our children about farmers and their vital role in society. With 2012 being the Australian Year of the Farmer, there is no better time for this to happen. I have heard stories about children not understanding where milk actually comes from. It is important that they do know and they understand what farmers do and contribute to society. Let us start educating our children and educating our communities to support farmers and recognise exactly what they do for our nation. They provide fresh produce and products for everyone to enjoy. There is no better way to enjoy vegetables than to eat them fresh, straight from the farm to your plate. Farming is a special way of life for so many around Australia. Some farms are handed down over generations. Other people have bought into farming. As a nation we need to encourage new people into farming. The exciting career options for young people in the agricultural sector need to be constantly highlighted to ensure that our farming communities remain strong and resilient into the future. We need to support our farmers into the future, to support local projects, to buy Australian produce, thus supporting our Aussie farmers. Our farmers are the providers and without them we would not have the fantastic fresh produce that we have today. I encourage members of this House, all electorates and all Australians to recognise, as the member for Maranoa has said, the 'vital role that Australian farming families and their industries play in keeping our nation fed, clothed and sheltered' and the wonderful contribution of all farmers in our great country, to make our economy great in this, the Year of the Farmer. Farmer and I take great pleasure and honour from commending my colleague Bruce Scott for introducing this motion, which I support. Bruce, like me, comes from a region which has a long history and is a very agricultural area. Calare is actually far older than Maranoa. The electorate of Calare is the first place that Wentworth, Lawson and Blaxland found when they",225,Private Members Business
206,Mr John Cobb (Calare) (18:48,"I rise to speak about the Australian Year of theheaded over the hills from Sydney. It is probably the oldest place where mining and agriculture began in a serious way in Australia. Mr Adams: Tasmania! is not only some of the most magnificent country in Australia but also one of the earliest places of European settlement in Australia-the oldest place outside the Sydney basin. It has some of the most magnificent farming land in Australia, be it broadacre, horticulture, fruit and vegetables, cropping or, particularly, sheep and cattle. It is the most magnificent grazing country I think I have ever seen in our fair land. Mr Adams: Have you been to Tasmania? year. While I know Australia loves its farmers and understands that without them there would be nothing to eat and far less to wear, few appreciate what is involved in creating those products. Farmers often deal with mother nature-we deal with her wrath. We think of that in terms of drought but, as we have seen in the last couple of years, mother nature can be pretty savage at the end of a great season and bring frost, hail or too much of a good thing at a time when we are about to strip. Farmers deal with these issues, whether drought or the absolute devastation of seeing something that you have waited years to grow come to grief. They understand and face the challenges that their industry offers. The last thing agriculture needs is a myriad of totally impractical regulations from local, state and federal governments-particularly from governments which are mistakenly of the belief that they are going to solve the environmental problems of the world. Often these things are going to do little to improve the environment. Having had to travel to Brazil and the US at the time of the BSE crisis, I can tell you that farmers in Australia, Brazil and the USA-and I suspect in most parts of the world-are far more worried about a government's reaction to environmental issues, whether climate change or anything else, than they are about the issues themselves. Emissions are an example. Climate change scientists and politicians love pointing at agriculture. They see it as the scapegoat and also as the solution, while ignoring the fact that the worse pollution is produced in the world's major cities. A classic example of this is Labor's carbon tax. In their wisdom, the government imposed a threshold. The inclusion of businesssize triggers in the carbon tax essentially penalise the largest emitters. However, agriculture's largest emitters such as dairy factories and abattoirs have already scaled up production and made efficiencies in their use of energy, whether gas or electricity, which means that they have already lowered their emissions per tonne of beef processed or whatever probably as much as they reasonably can. The government's legislation means that businesses will now have a disincentive to increase efficiencies. They will simply move to smaller operations and greater emissions per unit of production, with the net result actually being higher. This government is creating a cliff face. Once businesses hit 25,000 tonnes of emissions they are suddenly hit with a kind of tax none of us ever dreamt of. Anyone around that figure, or maybe even up to 30 per cent, is going to say, 'I think maybe we will take a day off a fortnight or a day off a week. It won't be in the interests of lowering carbon emissions but it will certainly save us a heck of a lot of money'.",226,Private Members Business
207,Mr John Cobb,Tasmania got other things that we will not talk about right now. This,227,Private Members Business
208,Mr John Cobb,"I love Tasmania-after Calare. It is high time that farming had itsAnother example of ludicrous government policy-and I mention this because agriculture has enough to deal with without bureaucracies and governments making it harder-is that, while heavy road vehicles have an exemption from the carbon tax, rail freight does not. This will be a $20 million impost on the rail industry, forcing more freight such as grain onto country roads and decimating them. The fallout from this ridiculous government policy is enormous but Labor does not seem to get it. Farming, like most businesses, is increasingly based on large production with small and variable margins. For the last 50 years, broadacre farming in particular has kept its head above water by increased productivity, but this has flattened out. The coalition is continuing to push the government to increase its contribution to agricultural research and development to revitalise the industry, to give it every advantage and improve productivity. However, Labor most definitely has not given up but has simply never faced up to it, with the agriculture minister recently telling Japan that Australia has little chance of increasing agricultural productivity. I cannot believe an agriculture minister in Australia would say that. For my whole life I have heard that the world's increasing population will make farmers more prosperous. Recently, the emergence of Asia has heightened this expectation-by recently, we mean in the last 30 years or so. The truth is that the emerging middle class in Asia is certainly having an incremental effect. But despite the hype, farmers recognise there is no overnight transformation. There will always be challenges for the sector, particularly from global trends. However, poor government policy seen throughout 2011-the carbon tax, the way live exports were dealt with, the basin plan, inadequate biosecurity, foreign ownership and food labelling arrangements-continued to put agriculture on the back foot. The shortage of graduates and skilled workers in the agriculture sector is a function of this Labor government's failure to stand up for this sector. Productivity and innovation are central to profitability. Unless we continually get renewal in the sector and keen, fresh new minds applying new ideas, we will not keep up that productivity which has kept Australian agriculture where it is. This needs to be supported by a government willing to stand up for it. The malaise is so bad in the current government that the agriculture department has removed agriculture from its primary mission statement, and is now: We work to sustain the way of life and prosperity for all Australians. That should be a government mission statement, not a specific department within it. Labor's indifference to agriculture is trashing the agricultural brand, undermining the industry, and is our nation's biggest threat to food security. The 2012 Year of the Farmer is a chance for the agricultural sector to explain the need for government to help with research and development, to educate researchers, agronomists and rural scientists towards increasing efficiency and productivity, and to have people with the ability to look after Australia's biosecurity and quarantine. We absolutely must have those people. In 2012, we the coalition will continue to support policies that give better outcomes, such as reviewing the competition and consumer laws. We also plan to finalise the development of our policies on coal seam gas, food labelling and foreign ownership to make sure our farming communities indeed get a fair go. Let us hope that all Australians urge every level of government to realise the need for practical solutions in agriculture. However, at this point in time only the Gillard government can remove its blind spot on agriculture and take the lead by using 2012-the Year of the Farmer-to be proactive and adopt policies that support rather than hinder our farmers. During the global financial crisis, it was not mining but our farming economy that at the end of the day stopped us going into an official recession. Agricultural production in this country drives $155 billion a year in economic production. That is still, in this day and age, over 12 per cent of GDP. There are over 1.6 million jobs involved, and exports in agricultural are $32 billion plus a year. I believe the Australian Year of the Farmer can be a rallying point to explain to mainstream Australia the realities confronting their(Time expired) Year of the Farmer. We should be positive. We should not be talking about being ruined. We should be talking about positive things that farming is doing in Australia and the future of farming, and not talking it down like we just got from the last speech. I welcome this discussion on the Australian Year of the Farmer, for 2012, which was brought to this place by the member for Maranoa. I thank him for giving me the opportunity to tell some of the good news stories, especially in my state of Tasmania. I believe this is a very important time to recognise the role that farmers play in our economy. There are quite a few changes taking place in the agriculture industry, as there always has been, but they are getting faster. It is an area where jobs are growing and we need to encourage more young people to see that there is a future in the farming industry working on farms, working in growing and in owning farms. RecentlyI had the opportunity with some of my Tasmanian colleagues to show the federal minister, Joe Ludwig, around our electorates to show what was happening there. We visited three electorates and covered some of the major areas of enterprise in agriculture and forestry, starting with Kelly's Sawmill, down at Dunalley-he is also a farmer-where we inspected new processes of timber engineering using smaller and thinner pieces of wood to make structural timber, which of course is one of the futures for the timber industry. We also met the Dalys, a farming family who grow potatoes. They are now growing and marketing new species of potatoes and undertaking research into the best products and species for niche markets and also for the major supermarkets in Sydney and Melbourne-the best high-product potatoes anywhere in the world, I would think. The last enterprise I visited in Lyons with the minister was Tasmanian Alkaloids, in Westbury, who process poppies. This is a highly successful industry that is still working on the edge of their markets exploring new directions for their industry. That, of course, goes out to the world. This industry employs more scientists than any other rural industry. It is in the forefront of our economy. There are many fantastic enterprises that now exist and will be part of the future of Tasmania. They certainly value our farmers in my state of Tasmania. Part of the success story is in fact because Tasmania has taken up the challenge of drought-proofing Tasmania, probably starting with David Llewellyn, a past state member for Lyons, who was the minister for primary industry. He saw that we needed to get irrigation schemes up and running if we were going to compete in the food market. In fact, Tasmania has 10 per cent of the rainfall that falls",227,Private Members Business
209,Mr Adams (Lyons) (18:59,"Doom and gloom is not what we should be doing in theon Australia, and we have around 1.5 per cent of the land mass. This gives us a natural advantage over the rest of Australia. We must take up that challenge and that advantage. Tasmania is now building irrigation schemes in public-private partnerships. The public contribution to the construction cost of the schemes comes from a pool of $220 million allocated for this purpose by the Tasmanian government and the Australian government. The private contribution comes from primary producers through the purchase of tradeable water entitlements and, of course, from putting the infrastructure in on their own farms-buying the pivots et cetera. The public contribution recognises that these water developments are beyond the resources of farmers alone and that in addition to benefiting individual farming enterprises it will benefit regional communities wherever possible. The public support relates not only to the capital construction but also considerable commitment to ensure that Tasmania has a good future in agriculture, as do our farmers. We now have to deal with the fact that, while we have good, rich soils, a good climate and a sustainable water supply, we lack and must have skilled workers. This is something that has been addressed recently with the announcement of $4.5 million to build the Agritas Trade College in Smithton in Tasmania. This will allow many young people to train in Tasmania and to study in an environment in which they can get work in the future. (Time expired) Ms MARINO (Forrest-Opposition Whip) (19:04): Agriculture in Australia is a $155 billion a year industry that underpins over 12 per cent of our nation's GDP, with the majority of that being exported. Of this about $640 million worth is produced in my electorate of Forrest. The industry directly employs 318,000 and also underpins the jobs of millions of Australians in food delivery and service. There are 136,000 farms throughout Australia that produce 93 per cent of the food we eat. I take this opportunity to thank the farmers for their hard work in keeping our plates full of quality food whilst helping our economy. We know that it was the ag exports that kept Australia out of recession. It is important for this parliament to recognise the value of Australian farmers and food producers-something that the Labor government has repeatedly failed to do. Australian farmers have not been supported; in fact, they have been assaulted. I ask this government and this parliament: do we want to keep agriculture, food production and manufacturing strong in Australia or will we continue to allow it to be undermined and undersupported? I understand the need to provide Australian families with high-quality, safe food and I understand the economic pressures on family budgets that mean families need that highquality, safe food to be as affordable as possible. Australian farmers have a worldwide reputation for producing safe and high-quality food products. In the report on food safety entitled Food safety performance world ranking 2008, Australia was one of the top-fiveperforming OECD countries for food safety standards, all of which were rated as superior. Australian farmers are also amongst the most efficient in the world, quick to embrace new technology and improved farming practices. As a farmer, I understand that Australian farmers can only continue in their business if they can achieve commercial returns that allow them to maintain their own families and businesses. Australian farmers have been subjected to a cycle of diminishing returns. According to the Western Australian department of agriculture, the broadacre region of WA averaged a rate of return to capital of around two per cent over the period 1989 to 2002-03. In comparison, the non-ag business world usually works on a minimum acceptable rate of return or hurdle rate of 12 per cent. The number of Australian farming families on the equivalent of welfare incomes, despite working long and hard hours, is of significant and pressing concern for this parliament. And the number of Australian farming families with a negative income is a national disgrace. The reasons range from vertical integration, market concentration and market power to issues to do with the supply and value chains, all leading to poor returns on investment driving the current generation of farmers out of considering food production and keeping the next generation away. We constantly get the government and the ACCC seeming to suggest that farmers have no right to make a profit. Farmers are the cannon fodder who become collateral damage in the supermarket war for profits and market share, with no support from either the ACCC or the government in this place. On top of this, Australian farmers have had to deal with the Labor Party's dreadful mismanagement of the live export trade. The bungling of this government on the question of live exports to Indonesia has done great damage to our international reputation and great damage to the farm sector, particularly in Western Australia. I commend the member for Maranoa for his motion and I really do want to congratulate and thank Australian farmers for the job they do. There are some people in this place who understand how hard you work, how well you do your job and what a great job you do in feeding our nation. I simply hope that in the Year of the Farmer this government might actually stop being a part of the problem faced by farmers and start acting to assist them. In that time is left to me I want to mention that I am seriously concerned about the Public Health Association of Australia's report suggesting it might be environmentally less wasteful of energy and water for some products such as dairy to be imported from New Zealand rather than produced locally. I am glad that Jock Laurie said that showed a lack of understanding and that Australian farmers are much more environmentally responsible, with a focus on water use, reduced carbon footprints and long-term sustainability. The PHAA fail to recognise this and, in my view, clearly have no respect at all for the job that our farmers do. I would say: shame on them. a region that is renowned for its rich agricultural diversity. Blair is a regional and rural seat located in South-East Queensland. It is full of areas that are familiar to people these days, some notorious like the Wivenhoe Dam, the Somerset Dam, the Lockyer Creek, the Bremer River and the Brisbane River. It is a beautiful but often dangerous place in South-East Queensland. Towns such as Toogoolawah are known for producing the nation's best beef. The saleyards are legendary in the Brisbane Valley in South-East Queensland. The meat works in my electorate at Kilcoy, Dinmore, Churchill and Coominya employ thousands of people and are integral to the success of farming regions west of Ipswich. Around Esk, there is dairy and beef farming. In the lower Brisbane Valley, around Minden, Patrick Estate and Coominya, horticulture is keen. Jimna was built around the forest industry. Coolana and Kilcoy produce gourmet-quality cheeses and olives, while the regions around Marburg and southern rural Ipswich produce wines. This is an area proud of its history of farming, with strong agricultural values.",229,Private Members Business
210,Mr Neumann (Blair) (19:09,"While not a farmer myself, I have lived my whole life inOur farmers continue to contribute to the economic lifeblood of our region. We have generational farmers in the Ipswich and Somerset regions-families who have helped to build the area and make it what it is today. You can see that from historical documents. You can find located at state schools like Haigslea the names of families that continue down through the generations. Doing mobile offices at agricultural shows in my electorate at Ipswich, Marburg, Rosewood, Lowood, Esk, Kilcoy and Toogoolawah, I can see the pride on farmers' faces when they display their beef cattle or honey and other produce that they have grown on the land. It is a great testimony to their courage and commitment. Many of these farmers have been to hell and back in the last 12 months, with 279 agribusinesses flood affected in the Somerset region. The export from Australia's farming community, particularly in South-East Queensland in my electorate, is considerable. It contributes to the national wealth of our country and employs literally thousands of people. I was instrumental in securing a $100,000 grant to the Somerset Region Business Alliance to provide advisory services to primary producers and small businesses impacted by the flood. A business expo was successfully run by the SRBA to assist local farmers and small business operators. Thousands of people attended it over a number of days. This was a very successful enterprise and it goes to show the initiative of a federal Labor government committed to the farming and rural sectors. The funding was made possible under the Small Business Advisory Services-National Disaster Assistance program. The Somerset Region Business Alliance has worked hard to promote local businesspeople, particularly those who work on the land. This is a very challenging time. The high dollar makes it even more difficult. I want to acknowledge the great work of people like Paul Heymans and Deb Ribinskas and others who worked tirelessly to help local businesses in these farming communities remain connected, informed and skilled. The Ipswich Business Enterprise Centre also received $100,000 to help small businesses throughout the Ipswich and West Moreton region. The centre has been providing assistance to businesses from Goodna to Grandchester through to Grantham. Our farmers require training, innovation and skills so that they can deal with the challenges they face-challenges of climate change, food security and global food shortage. I used to represent the Lockyer Valley, so I met with many farmers who were flood affected during my time as their member. I know the challenges they face from the floods that impacted on the Lockyer Valley. I am proud to see this federal Labor government investing in quality education. One of the great initiatives in my electorate was that undertaken by the Kilcoy State High School, which ensured that science and technology had real relevance to the agricultural industries around it. Last year, I proudly opened the Kilcoy State High School's $1.6 million science centre. You might ask: 'A science centre? Kilcoy is a rural community.' I picked up Kilcoy in the redistribution, and the funding to the school was made possible by a federal Labor government under Building the Education Revolution-opposed by those opposite, sadly. The science centre takes technology out of the classroom and onto the farm. I have been there to see what they grow and produce. The school's new facility connects the rural areas to the science and technology areas. This school is directly training tomorrow's farmers, offering them Certificate II in Rural Operations, and year 10 students went on an agribusiness excursion last year to the MackayWhitsunday region. This is a school blessed by the BER, which was opposed by those opposite, and it is tailoring its needs in a rural setting, equipping students for agricultural careers in the future. For too long the famers and landholders of Ipswich and Somerset were neglected by the coalition, who took their votes and their money and their support for granted. I am proud to be part of a federal Labor government that is investing in regional education and training. People who study in the regions tend to stay in the regions. While developing farmers for the future it is important to make sure that they stay in those regions and contribute to those regions. It is encouraging to see our universities embedding localism by offering educational opportunities that connect the skills of the local communities in regional and rural areas. Universities in and around my region have developed strong partnerships with local rural communities. This federal Labor government has increased the total regional loading for universities to $249.4 million to help these campuses continue operating. We have committed $265 million to provide 20,500 students in regional areas greater access to the youth allowance to make it easier for them to go to university. I have seen the benefit of that in my area. In the Somerset region, we have dozens and dozens of kids getting youth allowance for the first time. We have invested $176 million in building trade training centres, which help rural as well as urban people. This investment makes a difference to the students in Blair, many of whom travel into Ipswich to get training at wonderful trade training centres, like the trade training centre at St Edmunds in conjunction with Ipswich Grammar School and Ipswich Girls Grammar School, and Woodcrest State College in conjunction with Redbank Plains State High School. The Ipswich Region Trade Training Centre, which will be established in Ipswich itself at Ipswich State High, will have people coming from regional and rural areas. It will have students from Lowood State High, Rosewood State High, Bremer State High and Bundamba State Secondary College. Kids from urban backgrounds and kids from rural backgrounds will be getting training in mechanics, in plumbing and in other skills, and there will be training in rural industries as well. The Riverview Springfield Trade Training Centre will provide opportunities for students of St Peter Claver College and St Augustine's College at Augustine Heights. It is important to note that kids from rural areas come into Ipswich because that is where they get their secondary education. We are determined to make sure the kids who come from rural backgrounds get quality education. That is why we are investing such an amount of money in universities like the University of Queensland Ipswich campus and the University of Southern Queensland. I note my good friend the member for Oxley and I secured about $49 million for a campus right on the border. The member for Oxley and I lobbied very hard to make sure that that funding came to the University of Southern Queensland. We provided it because we know that kids from rural backgrounds go to that university. We are providing the funding for their tertiary study and we are providing the funding for their secondary study. I want to ensure that kids from farming backgrounds get access to the biggest marketplace in human history, and education is the key. Our Australian farmers in rural and regional areas will benefit from the kind of assistance we are providing. The NBN is warmly welcomed. I know it has been trialled in parts of my electorate, in the Brisbane Valley. I have seen it being trialled in places, for example at the computer business of Paul Heymans. Our investment in the Ipswich Motorway and the Blacksoil Interchange are critical for farmers in the western corridor as well. I cannot wait for the carbon farming initiative that will benefit people in my electorate. I have spoken to many farmers who are looking forward to having another source of income, and sadly those opposite should hang their heads in shame because once again they are opposing help for farmers. Dr STONE (Murray) (19:19): We are told it is the Australian Year of the Farmer. Many people in rural Australia really wonder if this is a sick joke, as they stare at their overdrafts and listen to the banks hammering on their door saying, 'Won't you sell your water? You owe us $1 million, your farm cannot be sold. But the government has just put out another tender in the Murray-Darling Basin and if you sell your water, sure, that means the end of your dairying but you can pay down some of your debt to us.' Those same farmers go to the supermarket. If people from the government had gone to the Coles supermarket in Kialla, which is in my area, they would have seen magnificent Australian plums selling for 50c a kilo. No-one can grow plums for 50c a kilo. You cannot grow them, pick them, pack them, prune them, store them, refrigerate them and put the sticky labels on them-that is, they simply cannot be producedfor 50c a kilo. Yet Coles is skiting about its 'down, down, down' 50 per cent cheaper prices for fruit and vegetables. You might ask, 'Why are the farmers selling their product at a loss?' The answer is that Coles and Woolworths between them own 80 per cent of the supermarkets in Australia, so the farmers have no choice. They cannot sneak off to a grocery ombudsman-or, as some have asked for, a supermarket ombudsman-and talk about the unconscionable use of market power by Coles and Woolworths. Where else would they go to sell their product? Fifty cents a kilo is below the cost of production, but at least the fruit does not fall on the ground. Also, they have a conscience: they know that a lot of pensioners can probably buy fruit for the first time at that price. The farmers are going broke, but someone is going to get a beautiful plum to take home. The carbon tax, which was mentioned by the previous speaker, is a joke. How many business enterprises in Australia other than the farmers would be made to comply with an act which required a covenant on their business for 100 years? But that is what Labor's carbon sequestration initiatives are all about. In addition, farms are going to be hit by the increased cost of utilities and the extra cost of wages with the new industrial laws about after-hours work. All that is a real problem. It makes farming less viable every day, yet here we are talking about the Australian Year of the Farmer and the need to celebrate it! We should celebrate the fact that the farmers of Australia on the 136,000 farms in this country are producing $405 billion worth of enterprise each year. They are not only producing that value at the farm gate but also generating jobs in transport, in food manufacturing, in retailing and in marketing. They generate export earnings which come back into the country. They do a magnificent job. In the course of their day-to-day activity of growing food and fibre in this country, the farmers also perform environmental services-that is, they produce the fresh air, the decent soils and the water quality, and they kill the feral animals and destroy the weeds. No-one else in the Australian economy does that. There are not enough public servants to go around, and no-one is paying public servants in the states or the Commonwealth to perform those environmental protection services anymore. The farmers do that work, but they cannot do it when they are near to being broke, and so many of our farmers-particularly those in the eastern arc of Australia-are doubly in debt as a result of 10 years of drought and then floods. We have to celebrate the extraordinary resilience of farm families, who battle on in the face of blow after blow, many of which are delivered through bad government policy. Think about the current exchange rate-the $1.06 and $1.07 exchange rate of the Australian dollar against the US dollar. Why isn't this government managing the dollar down when it is rendering not just farming export activity but also the activity of all our manufacturers less competitive in global markets? By the time the dollar comes down, if and when it does come down, we will already have lost so much of our manufacturing in Australia-and, quite frankly, you do not get it back. The country will be deskilled, and we will not make anything anymore. On the subject of deskilling, I point out that-contrary to what the previous speaker, the member for Blair, tried to claim-there has been an enormous decrease in the number of agricultural science and agribusiness graduates. This means that there is an enormous shortage each year of skilled people entering agribusiness. They ask themselves: 'Why would I? My father was a farmer, and his father was a farmer. Why would I suffer too? The risks are too great, and the returns are too small.' I am a sixth generation farmer myself, besides many other things. My brother and sister are farmers, and my only son is a farmer. I see what they do every day to try to produce good food and fibre for this country. Enough is enough-they deserve a decent set of policies in this country and a decent break. What they do should be respected. Let us celebrate the farmers. (Time expired) Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (19:24): I am very pleased to join members in the debate on this motion to recognise the Australian Year of the Farmer. I note it was put on the Notice Paper by the member for Maranoa, Bruce Scott. The member for Maranoa and I have shared the duty of representing many farmers in the central western parts of Queensland in this place. SoI am happy to support him in this motion. He states in the first point of his motion: … the Australian Year of the Farmer 2012 provides an opportunity to celebrate such achievements and to further strengthen the connections between rural and urban Australia … I am very proud to inform the House that coming up in Rockhampton in just a few months time is the Beef Australia Expo, a proud supporter of the 2012 Year of the Farmer initiative and a feature event of the Year of the Farmer Queensland Road Show. This will be the ninth Beef Expo-so the ninth time that Rockhampton has welcomed beef producers from around the world to our triennial Beef Expo. There are some new members here, so in case you have not heard me say this before, Rockhampton is the beef capital of Australia, a tag that we wear very proudly and never so proudly as when we do host that world's beef producers and researchers to our Beef Expo. This year we are expecting more than 70,000 people to go through the gates at Beef Australia in that week 7 May to 12 May. The theme of Beef Australia 2012 is innovation, collaboration, inspiration and celebration. When you look at the program for the week you can see just what a high-quality event this is, and what a truly international event it is. It really does celebrate and recognise and promote the full breadth of what the beef industry is all about. This is a very high-tech industry, it is a very innovative industry, and I am pleased to say that in Central Queensland it is a very strong and growing industry. To highlight the very international nature of the event, the proceedings will kick off with the Bayer and Bioniche International Beef Cattle Genetics Conference. That is a very important focus of the event, and it has grown as the beef expos have evolved over the years to focus on the full spectrum of the industry. I am pleased to say that the federal government is supporting the expo this year-once again supporting it very strongly-to the tune of over $2 million. I am hoping that the agriculture minister is able to make it along to the Brisbane launch of the expo next Thursday evening because he will get to hear first hand from the chairman, Geoff Murphy, and the CEO, Roger Desailly, just how progress is being made and how the $2 million is being spent to ensure that this year's expo is one to remember and continues the tradition of beef expos in the past, which are getting bigger and better every single time. I would like to tell the House that the good news for the agricultural sector in my electorate does not start and end with the beef industry. I was in Mackay last week and had the opportunity to meet, as I do regularly, with the chair and CEO of Mackay Sugar, which is the company that runs three of the sugar mills in Mackay. They told me that they are making terrific progress on the very exciting cogeneration project that they embarked upon a couple of years ago. They are putting in a $100 million investment to the Racecourse Mill, which will use the waste product from sugar cane milling, the gas, to produce the equivalent of one-third of Mackay's electricity. They are able to do that thanks to the renewable energy target which this government increased by way of legislation a couple of years ago. They will be ready to generate and sell electricity-they have already got the offtake agreement signedvery shortly. So, well done to Mackay Sugar. I look forward to seeing you grow and prosper. (Time expired) Debate adjourned. Apology to the Stolen Generation Debate resumed on motion by Ms Saffin: That this House: (1) recognises, on 13 February 2012, the fourth anniversary of the apology to the Stolen Generations; (2) affirms the sentiment expressed by this House on 13 February 2008, as a significant step to build a new relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians and recognise the suffering caused by past injustices; (3) expresses its support for members of the Stolen Generations and for the activities happening across Australia on 13 February to mark the anniversary of the apology; (4) recognises the significant efforts of groups including the National Stolen Generations Alliance and the National Sorry Day Committee to support and work for the interests of members of the Stolen Generations; and (5) notes the new special collection that will be established in the Parliamentary Library of historical documents presented by the National Sorry Day Committee, which documents our nation's shared journey toward reconciliation and the ongoing process of healing and justice for members of the Stolen Generations. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (19:29): I rise to speak to this motion. I thank the honourable members who will also speak on it. It is a little bit after the event, but not too far after it. When it was listed it was appropriate to have it on the record. This motion is in recognition of the fourth anniversary of the apology to stolen generations on 13 February 2012. The apology was a milestone in reconciliation and healing in Australia. The apology to stolen generations was the right thing to do and it was long overdue. I remember the debate in the community and how, after it was done, people felt good. That was true right across Australia and even beyond our shores. The notice taken of it internationally and regionally took a lot of people by surprise. That feedback came to all of us and it reflected well on Australia. The impact of the apology to stolen generations has been significant. It is significant symbolically. People often have a debate about symbolism and what is practical. Symbolism is important. It is a key feature of our society and of communities. We recognise, celebrate and commemorate through symbolism in every walk of life. It is no different for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I sometimes get a bit annoyed about the debate, because we have to recognise there is a place for all. Symbolism and putting things right are important, as is healing. Recognition of a wrong done is a way to help the healing. Goodness knows there needed to be healing. Symbolism is something the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists raised in talking about constitutional change, as my colleague the member for Hasluck would know because we were on the expert panel. The college talked about constitutional change in relation to the impact that it would have on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The college said: It would have a positive effect on self esteem and improve mental health. We all know that if our self esteem and our mental health improve, there are good practical, individual and societal outcomes as well. I am linking doing something that is symbolic to the impact that it can have on people and communities, and the flow-through of that is practical. It is important that we remember that. On the fourth anniversary, on 13 February 2012, a few initiatives were undertaken. It was the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and the Minister for Disability Reform, Jenny Macklin, who launched on that day the documents that will be kept as a repository. She talked about how those documents will reflect our history and the ongoing journey we are taking to continue the process of healing. Yes, there is healing, but I would rather talk about reconciliation, because reconciliation is important. What the minister said on the day was that these documents represent a story of courage and determination-a determination to provoke the public consciousness of our nation and get recognition(Time expired) the member for Page concerning the fourth anniversary of the apology to the stolen generation. The apology to the stolen generation was a very important landmark in our nation's history-for our history records that, since early last century, an estimated 50,000 children, most of them children of mixed Aboriginal and European relationships, were forcibly removed from their mothers and put in orphanages or given to European families. Although those engaged in this policy thought that they were doing the right thing and were acting in the best interests of child welfare at the time, we now understand that this was a great wrong that caused untold harm to those forcibly taken from their families and to the mothers who were left with no knowledge of their children's whereabouts. Although an apology of behalf of the government and this parliament will never ever take away the pain and heartache suffered by those families, this was an important step in addressing the appalling gap between the living standards of Indigenous Australians and the rest of our nation. Although we must learn from these mistakes of the past, we must also",231,Private Members Business
211,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (19:35,"I rise tonight to speak on the motion moved byrecognise that there will always be times when a government is required to intervene to protect children, as we have seen with the bipartisan intervention in the Northern Territory. However, removing a child from their mother must be the very last resort, only undertaken in the most extreme circumstances. Although we must confront the past, we must deal with the issues that we face todaynamely, that on average Indigenous Australians remain socially and economically disadvantaged compared to the Australian community as a whole. In seeking to close that gap, our goal must be to lift Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders' life expectancy, educational achievement, health and social well-being. But most of all we must lift their economic opportunities. Therefore, while motions like this are well intended, we must be very careful not to perpetuate a culture of 'sorry'. If we are going to close the gap, we are not going to do it with welfare handouts and ongoing 'sorry' motions but by providing economic opportunity and celebrating the success of our Indigenous community when and wherever it occurs. Therefore, to lift Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders' economic opportunity, we should be using our time in this place to highlight areas where the Aboriginal community is succeeding on the international stage, such as in the art and fashion worlds, as they are today, for today Aboriginal art is internationally renowned. It helps promote Australia to international audiences and it provides an invaluable addition to our tourist sector. It is estimated that Aboriginal art contributes $500 million per year to the Australian economy and is one of our leading export industries. Aboriginal art not only creates real wealth; it brings economic prosperity, provides meaningful employment opportunities to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and reinforces their identity and traditions, and has aided the maintenance of social cohesion. The creativity of Aboriginal art adds economic value. The evidence is that, prior to 2007, the record at auction for an Indigenous art work was $778,000, paid in 2003 for a Rover Thomas painting, All that Big Rain Coming from Top Side. In 2007 we had the first single Aboriginal artwork break the magic million-dollar mark, when a work by Emily Kngwarreye, measuring three metres tall and six metres wide and bursting with colour, called Earth's Creation, sold for $1.056 million. That record was eclipsed only a few months later when, in 2007, Clifford Possum's epic work, Warlugulong, was purchased for $2.4 million by the National Gallery. It is not just Aboriginal paintings that are setting the trend; it is also Aboriginal fabric design. TodayI am wearing a tie designed by Maureen Nampijinpa Hudson, a well-respected and accomplished Indigenous artist, titled Crow Women Dreaming. Hudson began her artistic career in 1981 and her works are now highly sought after by collectors around the world. I encourage all members to show their support for the masterful creativity of our Aboriginal art by wearing ties and scarves designed by Indigenous artists when making speeches in this parliament. The commercial success of our Aboriginal art is one avenue that brings respect and dignity to Aboriginal communities, and it assists in providing economic development and opportunity, thereby assisting to build new relationships between the Indigenous and nonIndigenous communities. (Time expired) generations motion before the parliament and I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this",237,Private Members Business
212,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (19:40,"I thank the member for Page for putting this stolendebate. I hope it does say something that there are two members speaking from the North Coast of New South Wales, an area quite often forgotten in debate around Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples when looking at demographics and where people live. More than 50 per cent of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders live in a corridor on the coast between Sydney and roughly Rockhampton. The very large Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities of the East Coast are an important part of the story of Australia. I am very pleased to once again make that point to the House. I hope to see more work done in public policy on the east coast of Australia. I was not in the parliament when the sorry speech took place. I was travelling through Sydney airport the day after. It was really noticeable that there were many people travelling home from that speech. People were 10 feet tall. Walking through the airport, I saw some very proud individuals on the back of the sorry speech and the sorry day and the significance of that to their lives. That really drove home to me the message about how important that moment was, not just for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders but for all Australians as a step on the journey of reconciliation and building the best possible Australia for all of us. I have heard simple words. I have heard it called symbolism. We just heard some reflections that we do not want to build a culture of sorry. I do not think that is what this was about at all. It was something that should have been done a long time ago and it was long overdue and I am glad it was done. But, on the fourth anniversary, it should not be the only bit of work on the journey of reconciliation. Whilst it was one important step, it is one part of a myriad of work that community and government are doing, and trying to do, in partnership with community. I often hear people in politics talk about the government doing this, we do that and theyas in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders-should do something else. I hope we all in public policy recognise that some of the best work in recent times has been done not in Canberra and not in public policy but in the hearts and minds of many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, who understand their history better than any of us and are determined through a whole number of ways to build a generation of change. I think that is some of the most exciting work being done within all our communities. It really does not involve us much at all. It is a determination by a community that for a long time has been marginalised for a whole number of reasons by the Crown but, despite that, shows incredible resilience as individuals and as a community and as a culture. So whilst sorry and the sorry message were incredibly important I would hope the resilience of the world's longest-standing culture is remembered above all, and I am very confident that we live in a generation where it is going to shine and, hopefully, we in public policy can keep up with community delivering a standard that Australians should celebrate, not feel in any way guilty about at all. parliamentary colleagues in speaking on this motion. I think one of the most important things that should always be remembered is that when the Hon. Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister delivered the apology it served as a catalyst for the change that occurred within the immediacy of that apology-and that was the healing process. It was a bringing together of so many Australians who have walked together for some time, building relationships and forging change. But I think the more important element to this was the reform work that commenced after that, and that reform work was the COAG reform agenda, because out of that came a",238,Private Members Business
213,Mr Wyatt (Hasluck) (19:45,"I want to acknowledge the words of my threenumber of initiatives. There were seven agreements under financial relationships with the states and territories, but more importantly there were 26 national partnership agreements. All of them have measures that are both tangible, that have reality to them and that go to the core of the delivery of government services. I also believe that Sorry Day now should be a celebration of the jewels in the crown of achievement that is occurring across this nation. I think, importantly, there are many things that are now working, driven in partnership or driven exclusively by people whose passion to make a difference is transforming the mindset that prevailed for a long time. The other important thing in all of this is that the long-term thinking and beneficial gain that will be made through the initiatives implemented by the government will have a long term consequence in that they are enabling young Aboriginal Australians to walk a pathway that many of us of my age fought for. In that journey what they will achieve in closing the gap will be much more significant because they have helped shape it as well. One of the greatest things we can do is to look at all of the agreements and at the national partnership agreements and then measure the success of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders against all of those measures, not just the Indigenous ones. When we measure against the societal measures for each of the NPAs and each of the agreements and we have gap-closure in those fields then I believe we can truly say that we are closing the gap. As one of my colleagues referred to, 75 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people live within urban populations. In many senses when you look at the NPAs they are targeted and focused on rural and remote regions. I have no problem nor challenge with that, but if we are to address the urban context then the application of the seven agreements and the national partnership agreements will certainly see us close those gaps. But we have to change our thinking in respect to it. We should not talk about mainstream services, because mainstream services really are government services; it is how we access Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into that whole gamut and that whole range of services that states and territories and Commonwealth governments provide through the agencies. I would rather see at the end of 10 years that we can tick that off in the national partnership agreements and we can honestly say as a nation, 'We have made substantial gain and progress.' Because when we say that and we can tick off on that it means we have achieved the closing of the gap based on merit and not based on the fact that we have had to pour more money into targeted national Indigenous agreement arrangements. They should complement the work we do for broader society. Certainly the discussions we had at different times when the expert panel was meeting was on one of the other elements that I think is absolutely critical, and I made some comments this morning in the chamber-that is, we have to have Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as equal partners at any table at which we negotiate new arrangements, the delivery of services, policy development and the things that will make a difference to their lives. I hope that in 20 years time we have Australians looking for an Indigenous family heritage linkage and they can proudly say, 'We have Aboriginal heritage within our family.'

Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians Debate resumed on motion by Mr Oakeshott: That this House: (1) supports the unanimous recommendations contained in the report of January 2012, titled 'Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in the Constitution: Report of the Expert Panel'; (2) calls on the Prime Minister to hold a referendum on Saturday 24 November 2012 that will: (a) repeal section 25 of the Constitution; (b) repeal section 51 (xxvi) of the Constitution; and (c) contain a new section, 'section 51A' along the following lines: Section 51A Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples Recognising that the continent and its islands now known as Australia were first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; Acknowledging the continuing relationship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with their traditional lands and waters; Respecting the continuing cultures, languages and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; and Acknowledging the need to secure the advancement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; the Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; (3) proposes together, the repeal of section 51 (xxvi) and insertion of section 51A; (4) inserts a new section, 'section 116A', along the following lines: Section 116A Prohibition of racial discrimination (1) The Commonwealth, a State or a Territory shall not discriminate on the grounds of race, colour or ethnic or national origin. (2) Subsection (1) does not preclude the making of laws or measures for the purpose of overcoming disadvantage, ameliorating the effects of past discrimination, or protecting the cultures, languages or heritage of any group; and (5) inserts a new section, 'section 127A', along the following lines: Section 127A Recognition of languages (1) The national language of the Commonwealth of Australia is English. (2) The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages are the original Australian languages, a part of our national heritage. Speaker, I would like to hang a T-shirt over the front here, which I am sure other members participating in this debate may also like to do. It is the education campaign that is a part of trying to get constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is the You Me Unity campaign and people can go to the website to engage. The Australian Constitution is more than 100 years old and has provided a durable framework for the governments of the nation.

214,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (19:50,"With your indulgence, Madam Acting Deputythe time of the formation of the Commonwealth, and Australia's first Prime Minister. SoI live in a community that recognises the place of the Australian Constitution and its importance to the development of Australia as a whole. However, I do think it is reflective of the time and the interests of the men who drafted it but, since the 1967 referendum, it still makes no reference to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people whatsoever. It was drafted at a time when the legal status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people was in question, so much so that some references suggest that the legal status of an Aboriginal person was no more than that of flora or fauna. I would hope that we in Australia today can do better. We in Australia today have an opportunity to make some small changes to our Constitution and to do some unfinished business. This is not about three per cent of Australia's population making a claim on our crown document. This is about 100 per cent of Australia finding a path where we recognise our stories of the past, for good and for bad, and finding a way to form a partnership for the future. Our lead document should refer to our unique and oldest culture in the world. It should celebrate some of the extraordinary parts of that culture, whether that is Aboriginal languages, culture and heritage or whether that is, by inference, Dreaming, connection to land or connection to place. These are all part of the Australian story, not just the Aboriginal and Torres Islander story. So, again, I look for celebration through this process of You Me Unity trying to get a referendum question put to the Australian people and for a majority vote in support of the question put. I was humbled to participate in the expert panel. The work was outstanding. The panel was co-chaired by Mark Leibler and Pat Dodson, both excellent men doing excellent work, and I thank them for the work they did. I thank all panel members for their considerations and reflections and for looking at the bigger picture when at times it would have been very easy to get lost in some of the personality clashes in a room of 22 people or in some of the conflicts over detail in what is a complex issue to try to resolve. Between May and October last year over 200 consultations were held throughout Australia in 80 locations. The panel received about 2,500 submissions. The consultation was extensive. I take this opportunity to reaffirm to the House that this is not some elitist push; it is not some left-wing latte-drinking waste of time and money; it is a groundswell in Australia that wants this issue dealt with. Ordinary people want this issue dealt with. Communities in regional areas with quite large Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations want this issue dealt with. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves want this issue dealt with. I hope we respect that and I hope we as public policy makers do what we can to put a referendum to the people and do what we can to get a majority yes vote. It matters. the Constitution is coalition policy going back many years. The coalition has a proud history of support for constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. A move to have something meaningful and worthwhile included in the Constitution preamble was seen as a good starting point. Making constitutional change is a difficult process. To date, 44 referenda have been held, of which only eight have been carried. To ensure that a referendum including Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders passes and, for that matter, one recognising local government would require taking the people along with the spirit of why change is considered necessary. This would not have been easy in the past, nor will it be a",241,Private Members Business
215,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (19:55,"Having the first Australians recognised as part ofsmooth passage if and when constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders is put to all Australian voters in the future. The preamble of the Constitution is not subject to interpretation by the courts, and that is an important factor when this issue is being debated and decided. That is why there was a move to push for suitable recognition within the preamble wording. In 1999, however, the coalition's referendum proposing a preamble inclusive of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders was defeated. Further proposals for constitutional recognition were taken by the coalition to the 2007 election. However, Labor under Kevin Rudd won office. A 300-page report was released on 19 January 2012 by an expert panel of 19 people. If adopted, it would seek to place recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia's history by appropriate words being included in the Constitution and to remove all provisions of the Constitution which are plainly of a racially discriminatory character. The suggestion is to include, as proposed section 51A, words effectively recognising that Australia was first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders; acknowledging their continuing relationship with traditional lands and waters; respecting their continuing cultures, languages and heritage; and acknowledging the need to secure their advancement. These are admirable sentiments-words which go to the heart of what most fair-minded Australians would agree to and uphold. Proposed section 116A, prohibiting racial discrimination, and proposed section 127A, recognising their language, are also on the surface reasonable and timely. As an aside, but important in the context when talking about Aboriginal language, I must praise the extraordinary work of authors and compilers of A New Dictionary of Wiradjuri, Stan Grant and John Rudder, both from my region. They have been diligently working together since 1997 to see Wiradjuri language learned and spoken again. Stan also works with youth who are getting their lives together at Tirkandi Inaburra, near Coleambally, a community-run development and educational centre offering Aboriginal boys aged 12 to 15 a residential program aimed at reducing future contact with the criminal justice system by strengthening cultural identity, self-esteem and resilience. The centre is having a positive impact on the lives of those who have been mentored there. Indeed, the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs, Nigel Scullion, who visited Tirkandi Inaburra on 2 December last year, believes the concept ought to be replicated right across Australia. On the matter before us of constitutional recognition, Senator Scullion is on the record as saying: … special clauses about discrimination will lead to a much wider debate about multiculturalism and I think the debate will really ambush the process. He is right, of course. As to the recent announcement of the expert panel's report, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'My aim is to achieve unity.' The slogan on the T-shirt just displayed by the member for Lyne reads: 'YouMeUnity.' We all want unity. Importantly, all Australians want to see respectful and adequate recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. As I said in my inaugural speech: Nationally we need to do more for Aboriginal health to increase the life expectancy and standard of living of our first nation people. Help needs to go where it is most needed. Words are one thing-spoken, as in saying sorry, or in a document such as the Constitution-but genuine, urgently needed actions, such as better health, more affordable housing and greater job prospects for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in rural and remote areas, are of critical importance if we as a nation are to truly achieve unity and harmony. The money is there to achieve such goals; it just needs to be apportioned to where it is most needed. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (20:00): I would like to thank the honourable member for Lyne for putting this motion before the parliament so we can speak to it. I am very familiar with the content of the motion because it is the recommendations from the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians. I served on that panel with the honourable member for Lyne, the honourable member for Hasluck and Senator the Hon. Rachel Siewert, from Western Australia. I would like to read some of the things I said about it in a statement. I made at home, in my local community. I was asked, 'What does all this mean and where do we go to now?' I would also like to talk briefly about the grassroots campaign that is starting with Reconciliation Australia. In December 2010 I received a telephone call from Minister Jenny Macklin asking me on behalf of the Prime Minister whether I would serve on the expert panel. I said yes, feeling excited to be given an historic opportunity to be part of a process that could be of both symbolic and practical significance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and all Australians and that could also contribute to reconciliation and healing. As a long-term member of the Australian Labor Party, the apology and constitutional recognition are two of the policy positions that we have debated, discussed, come to and promoted for a long time, so I felt quite privileged and quite pleased. Constitutional recognition had the support of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Independents, the Greens and everyone else in the parliament at the time, so we started from a good base, particularly with the two major parties supporting it. That was a really good basis to go into the expert panel with. Of course the debate was always going to be, and always will be, around what form that takes, which is as it should be. There were 22 members across a spectrum on that panel. I said earlier today in another debate in this place that it was challenging. It was wonderful and it was challenging to be part of a group of such strong minded people, all with views, who have all made a great contribution to Australian life. Some of them are known and some are not so known. The cochairs, Mark Leiber and Patrick Dodson, did a wonderful job keeping us focused on recommendations which were meaningful and which would gel with Australians but never losing sight of what we had to do, which was give meaningful recognition in the Constitution to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The four principles that we adopted were that whatever we came up with had to be legally and technically sound; had to be of benefit to and in accord with the wishes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; had to be capable of being supported by an overwhelming majority of Australians from across the political and social spectrums; and had to contribute to a more unified and reconciled nation. It was no easy task to sit around and come up with something that was meaningful. There were 200 public consultations across 84 communities. Two were held in Grafton and Lismore. The honourable member for Lyne and I conducted the one in Lismore. Like anything, we started off at the time saying we wanted Rolls-Royce, which is normal, whatever it may be. But people would say, 'Look, we do want this recognition and we don't want this to fail. We want this to get through. So we want you in the parliament and you the parties to do something that actually gets through. We want this. This is the time to do it.' That was agreed by everybody in all of the consultations that we had. To achieve this, there was absolute agreement all across Australia to remove section 25. Most people do not know it, but when they do get to know it of course they say that this is something that just has to go. I would like to commend, You Me Unity-yes, I have the t-shirts, yes I have the badges, yes I have all of those things for the great(Time expired) National Party, I want to put on record that the Nationals hold the strong belief that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples should be held in high respect by the community for the special and unique contribution that they have made to the nation, not only in its ancient history but in its current identity and its future prosperity. The Nationals believe that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, like all Australian citizens, are entitled to self-determination to pursue economic prosperity and social cohesion free from constraints and without prejudice. In that vein, we believe that the Australian Constitution should make reference to Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and we encourage the government, the parliament and all political parties, for that matter, to foster public discussion on changing the preamble to reflect the importance of the place that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people actually hold in this nation. But at the same time we recognise there is a need for a shift in policy direction; a shift from the old government-knows-best approach to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people being able to take responsibility for themselves and their families. When I talk to people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent in the Mackay region and right throughout the Dawson electorate, they say to me that this is what they mean by self-determination. So while I strongly support the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in our Constitution and strongly support the repeal of any sections based on race or race powerssection 25, section 51 and subsection 25-I do not support their replacement with another clause that will simply perpetuate discrimination. What they should be replaced with is a clause banning the federal government from actually making laws based on race. There have been many success stories in improving the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people when they were able to gain access to the same services as many others in our society. We see our nation's first people establishing long-term employment and conducting happy family lives without the need for anything further from government when we can get them into the mainstream. I believe we have to ensure that mainstream government services are delivered in an culturally appropriate manner according to the clientele, of course. But we should begin that move to providing services in a mainstream delivery fashion rather than by the multiple specifically Indigenous assistance programs which are out there. This will not be the outcome if we have a clause placed in the Constitution which allows governments to continue with discrimination, whether it is positive or otherwise, toward Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Keeping these separate systems in place is really just creating a silo for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues instead of addressing the needs of them with all other Australians, and ensuring that when government policy is",242,Private Members Business
216,Mr Christensen (Dawson) (20:05,"As a member of the federal parliamentarydirected at improving the lives of all Australians that that includes Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This view is partially shared-not fully I have to say-by Noel Pearson, who does say that if that section of the Constitution is to be removed and an antiracial discrimination clause is not included, then Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will go backwards. Another respected Aboriginal Australian, Warren Mundine, goes further in his opposition to proposals to make laws for the advancement of Aboriginal people. He fears that that would lead to protection for predatory traditional customs such as child brides. He calls it a Pandora's box. Before this got to this parliament, people were talking about it in the Samuel Griffith Society which I was associated with in the past. Lawyer and former Dean of the Melbourne Law School, Colin Howard, put that these sections of the Constitution should be pulled. He said that it is high time that laws based on race be recognised for the irrational nonsense that they are. In saying that while there is a lot of good, he pointed out that race as a basis for making rational law is self-contradictory, because there is only one race and that is the human race. I agree with Dr Howard that we need to erase racism and discrimination from our Constitution even if it is reverse racism. (Time expired) Debate adjourned. General Motors Holden Plant, Elizabeth, South Australia Debate resumed on motion by Mr Zappia: That this House: (1) notes that the General Motors Holden plant in Elizabeth is an iconic South Australian industry directly employing around 2500 people; (2) acknowledges the important contribution the General Motors Holden Elizabeth plant makes to the South Australian economy and to the broader Australian manufacturing industry; (3) recognises the importance of the visit to Detroit in January 2012 by the Minister for Manufacturing, Senator the Hon. Kim Carr, and South Australian Premier, the Hon. Jay Weatherill, in securing the long term future of the General Motors Holden Elizabeth plant, and commends both of them for their efforts in support of the jobs of thousands of South Australians; and (4) condemns the Coalition for the uncertainty being created by its policy to cut $500 million from the auto industry. will note that there are four parts to it. In the course of my remarks on this matter, I will try to touch on each one of those four parts. The first notes that the General Motors Holden plant in Elizabeth is an iconic South Australian industry that directly employs around 2,500 people. In recent times, there has been considerable public debate about the economy and jobs in Australia-rightly so, because the two are linked. A strong economy means more jobs, and if people are working it is a sign of a strong economy. A strong economy and jobs mean security for Australian families. Long-term jobs and economic security are important not only to Australian families but to whole communities and the country as a whole. The notion that we are debating goes to the heart of jobs and economic security for tens of thousands of people not only in South Australia but right around the country. If General Motors Holden's operations in Australia were to cease or even be scaled back there would be a cascading effect through other employment sectors and, in turn, through communities across",245,Private Members Business
217,Mr Zappia (Makin) (20:11,"In moving the motion that stands in my name, the House the country. The Gillard government well understands that. The South Australian government well understands that. The only political party that does not seem to understand that is the coalition, both here in federal politics and at state level in South Australia. These coalition parties do not understand the importance of the automotive industry to South Australia and to the nation as a whole. That is why earlier this year the Minister for Manufacturing Senator Kim Carr and South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill travelled to Detroit in the USA to speak to executives of GM and Ford in order to secure a long-term future for GM and Ford operations in Australia. Senator Carr and Premier Weatherill should be commended for doing so, and that is part of my motion. They should be commended because their trip to the USA sent a very clear message to all about the importance of the car industry to Australia. It is important as an industry sector and it is important to the lives of tens of thousands of people who directly depend on it. Their visit to Detroit and the USA sent a very clear message to the people that work in that industry gave them hope for the future, knowing full well that around the world the automotive sector is finding it very difficult right now. If ever there was a time when political leadership was needed, securing the long-term future of the Australian automotive industry was such a time. I commend Senator Carr and Premier Weatherill for making the time to go and speak directly with the heads of the automotive sector in the USA. Those who argue that we should stop supporting the auto industry take a simplistic, narrow-minded view of its importance to our economy, to the creation of jobs and to the lives of workers within that industry. The GMH plant at Elizabeth effectively started off in 1958, and it has been critical to the economy of Adelaide's northern region for nearly 50 years now. Today, as I said earlier, the plant employs about 2,500 employees. It makes about 90,000 cars a year, and I recall that only a few years ago the figure was almost double that. In the last decade alone, it has generated hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in the new automotive supply industries in Edinburgh Parks, located adjacent to the GMH plant and providing GMH components on a just-in-time production system. I am very familiar with that because it happened during the time that I was mayor of the city of Salisbury and I know how important it was not only to GMH but to the region as a whole and to so many other industries that are reliant on those businesses that have established themselves at Edinburgh Parks. It truly is a multihundred-million dollar investment, which today generates and creates thousands of jobs. Each of those businesses there not only today support the automotive industry but industries around the country. So the importance of those industries extends much further than just the region within which they are located. The direct and indirect jobs created would, as I have said, run into tens of thousands. But there is a broader effect on the region when jobs are lost, as we have seen in other communities around the country. I am sure that the member for Riverina would understand the impact of what happens to communities when jobs are lost because, apart from the jobs being lost, what we also then start seeing are higher social costs-people defaulting on their mortgages, health costs rising and the like. That would certainly happen in the region that I represent if GMH was not there or started to scale down its operations. When members opposite criticise the government assistance to the automotive industry, consider what the alternative social costs would be if we do not support that industry and it collapses. Even doing a very basic calculation of income tax lost in one year alone if the plant were to close, you would soon find that the amount of income tax revenue lost to the government would probably be far, far greater than the assistance that is being talked about. That is without looking at unemployment payments, training packages and losses in other industry, and that is simply from that plant alone. Yes, it is true that some employees might find alternative work in the long term, but that will not happen straight away. Even if it does happen, they will need reskilling, because the employees we have at GMH at Elizabeth are very highly skilled employees but they are skilled for the job that they were doing. Their skilling was part and parcel of their training over the years as part of their employment with GMH. It would be an absolute shame to lose those skills altogether. I have talked about the indirect job losses that would also flow as a result of the GMH plant closing because the automotive industry in this country underpins much of our engineering and advanced manufacturing expertise. The skills and know-how that emanate from the GMH plant flow through to other industries. That would all be lost. But, of course, there are other implications and I just want to quickly talk about a couple of them. One of them is this: if that plant closes, the exports from that plant close. The sales of Australian made cars in Australia also decrease, and that means more imports. So we reduce our exports and we increase our imports. That affects our balance of trade and then there is a flow-on effect in other economic impacts. The automotive industry in this country employs some 46,000 people directly and around 200,000 or more indirectly. Then if you put on top of that all the manufacturing jobs that are somewhat associated with the automotive industry, it is a huge base that is entirely reliant on it. When we talk about support by the government for the automotive industry in this country, it is important that we put it into perspective by comparing it with what is happening in other countries. I am sure my colleague here the member for Wakefield, who has spoken on this issue on many occasions, will talk about that comparison. It is clear to me from the figures that I have seen that when we put on the table what this government is putting on the table in terms of taxpayers' dollars-which equates to around $18 per person in Australia-and we compare that with what is happening overseas-with figures of up to $265 per person in the USA-we start to understand that the money that is being requested is not unreasonable. Furthermore, whatever the government puts on the table is usually matched three or four to one. So, again, what it is really doing is bringing money into this country. The last point I want to make refers to the condemnation of the coalition for their particular position on it. The automotive industry does not operate on a year-to-year basis. They need a five-year forward plan program in place. They need to know today what is going to happen in five years time in order to make the necessary changes and investment. For the coalition to say that they are going to cut $500 million out of the government's support program for the automotive sector in this country is to create uncertainty for the whole of the community and uncertainty for the industry. Let me assure members of the coalition that the people I speak to understand that. The communities that I speak to understand that, the journalists who have written about this story understand that and, certainly, the workers at GMH understand that. The coalition should be condemned for creating the uncertainty they have in the minds and the lives of those families living in the region I represent and which the member for Wakefield represents because of their intention to cut $500 million from government assistance to the automotive industry in this country. (Time expired) Elizabeth is an iconic South Australian industry. It is an important manufacturing base, the vibrancy and well-being of which is the very pulse of this nation's manufacturing heartbeat. The fact that GMH directly employs around 2½ thousand people is proof enough of just how vital it is to the Australian economy. The indirect benefits that GMH brings to its home state and to the country generally are enormous. It is one of the most trusted automotive brands worldwide. The fact that Australians can drive a product built right here with care and precision, using Australian standards and Australian workers, instils a deep sense of deep achievement and pride in all of us. The January 2012 visit to Detroit in the United States of America by the Minister for Manufacturing, Senator Kim Carr, and the South Australian Premier, Jay Weatherill, seeking to secure the long-term future of the General Motors Holden Elizabeth plant, was essential. It was the very least these important players in the whole equation could have done. They did what would be expected of them. They need to do anything and everything to support the jobs, direct and indirect, of thousands of South Australians. I agree with the member for Makin, who said that when jobs are lost there are high social costs to a community; people, unfortunately, end up defaulting on mortgages. Unfortunately, when jobs are lost our Prime Minister describes them, passes them off and dismisses them as 'growing pains'-a very unfortunate thing to say. I believe the member for Makin when he says that the automotive industry underpins much of Australia's engineering and manufacturing expertise. He is right; he is so correct. As he pointed out, quite correctly, fewer homemade cars means more imports. This affects, as he correctly pointed out, our balance-of-trade figures. But one of the greatest threats looming large over the Australian manufacturing sector is the carbon tax. To take effect from 1 July, the carbon tax will hit manufacturing hard, including the automotive industry. It will send many Australian jobs offshore. As a nation, we neither can afford nor need a carbon tax. The timing of it simply could not be worse. With European economies in meltdown and the United States of America facing such fiscal uncertainty it is simply unfathomable why this Labor government is pushing ahead with its carbon tax, which will hurt Australian families, which will hurt Australian manufacturing and which will hurt car makers such as GMH at Elizabeth. The national divisional secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union vehicle division, Ian Jones, put it bluntly yet accurately when he said: … the Prime Minister does not understand manufacturing's importance to the economy. This Labor-Greens Alliance does not understand the importance of manufacturing. It has let the Prime Minister forge ahead with the carbon tax in order to stay in power. It is a tax which will affect all industries and do nothing to help the environment. The Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers chief executive officer, Richard Reilly, said: We are going to be impacted by a carbon tax, and our competitors won't. This government will impose a $460 million carbon tax on the automotive industry at a time when we should be bunkering down against the global downturn and doing everything we can",246,Private Members Business
218,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (20:21,"Certainly, the General Motors Holden plant into sustain and even to boost local manufacturing. In the 2010 election the coalition was upfront and honest with the Australian public about a $278 million cut from the Green Car Innovation Fund. Labor, however, slashed $885 million from the fund only months after the 2010 election-yet another example of a broken promise from a broken government. Labor has broken $1.4 billion in promises to the car industry. It has jacked up luxury car taxes and made changes to the fringe benefits tax. In my electorate of Riverina the Wagga Motors dealership is seeing up to $15,000 dropped from the drive-away price of luxury imported cars as the standard model now includes all elements that were previously added extras. Wagga Motors dealership principal Scott Braid said: We have to rely on turnover now (to make significant revenue), not up-selling to better packages. The Aussie dollar pressure is pressure on the manufacturer's margin and also our own. The last thing Wagga Motors and other regional dealers whose margins are already under pressure need is for GMH in South Australia to be hit hard. The last thing regional motor dealerships need is for families to feel the full brunt of an unnecessary and unaffordable carbon tax to make buying that next vehicle an unrealistic option. The Automotive Transformation Scheme is the biggest fund from which assistance is given to the auto industry, and it is a retrospective scheme. Certain parameters need to be achieved: production outcomes, investment in research and development and investment in plant and equipment. At Senate estimates this month it was revealed that at least $34 million may have been paid out in breach of Labor's own car industry funding legislation. In the words of the shadow minister for industry, innovation and science, the member for Indi, reacting to the Senate estimates leak, the government were saying: 'It's okay; you don't have to comply with any of these requirements for funding. If there is money left over in the fund, well, it is up to us. If you're nice to us we might give it to you.' This government is borrowing $10 0 million a day. How can it make these promises? The coalition has provided generous support to the car industry when in government in the past. A plan was put together by the Howard government that was to run from 2002 to 2015, with a Productivity Commission review in 2008, underpinned by set parameters and guidelines with transparency, as with all things that administration undertook, being a hallmark. However, former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd abolished the plan in 2007 and in doing so stripped $1.4 billion from the car industry. On 23 January 2012 Toyota announced it would be axing 350 jobs at its Altona North factory. That is one in 10 jobs by mid April-literally a decimation. On2 February 2012 another 100 jobs were lost at Holden. These are jobs that Australian families can ill afford to lose-families who pay taxes, families who have kids at school, families who just want job security for the future. The manufacturing minister's stewardship of his portfolio, both in opposition and in government, has been underwhelming. He has been found to be wanting. He, along with the Prime Minister, said he wanted to be a minister in a country that still made things. That is a view all of us in this place should share. But, given what is happening and what this Labor government has in store, it is going to be a bumpy road ahead. In recent times, 75,000 workers have lost their jobs while being promised job security in the manufacturing sector, and the Prime Minister brushes this aside as 'growing pains'. On 3AW radio station earlier the minister himself said about manufacturing jobs, 'I wouldn't say anyone's job was safe.' Months later, the union movement itself was telling us that the manufacturing sector is in crisis. That was courtesy of the Australian Workers Union. So we have a sector in which no job is safe, according to the minister, and sector that is in crisis, according to Labor's own union movement. This is not an ideal time to be foisting a carbon tax on the manufacturing industry and the largely unsuspecting people of Australia. I say 'unsuspecting' because just prior to the 2010 election the Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' And we all know that the government, in order to keep faith with the Greens and to keep faith with the regional Independents and to keep in office, has now turned around and imposed a carbon tax on an unsuspecting Australian people. The Prime Minister's words on the future of the car industry and business innovation at her so-called major speech on 1 February this year are hollow, because they lack credibility. The Prime Minister raised the role of sovereign risk in current global instability, but she failed to mention her own broken promises to the car industry, which have sparked that very reality here in Australia. On 27 June 2011 GM Holden's chairman and managing director, Mike Devereux, said: We cut a deal with the Prime Minister back in 2008 and then, mid-way through, the rules of the game changed. … it certainly worries a multi-national parent when sovereign risk begins to be something that is bandied about in terms of doing business in Australia. How true those words still ring today. If the Prime Minister had a genuine interest in the car industry, in manufacturing or in innovation she never would have broken her promise not to introduce a carbon tax, which will be a $460 million burden on the industry. She would not have broken $1.4 billion of car industry promises. She would not have dumped manufacturing from cabinet. She would not have crippled government support for business research and development and she would not have completely failed to stem the worse rate of manufacturing job losses in Australia's history. This is also a Prime Minister who has such a poor understanding of the car industry that she ridiculously claimed Cash for Clunkers was a groundbreaking program and that it would have changed the way we live. Both of these programs have since been axed as part of the trashing of an amazing $1.4 billion of Labor broken promises to car makers. Manufacturing jobs in the automotive industry are important and we should do everything we can to help them. But, unfortunately, the Labor government is not. member for Riverina. It was more about ranting about the carbon tax. It was a strange combination between a broken record and a parrot banging on about the carbon tax. I do not know what you are going to do come 1 July. I do not know what you are going to talk about. This motion has very ably been presented to the Federation Chamber by the member for Makin, who is a great champion of the car industry-if you will allow me the pun. He has been, for a very long time, a bit of an icon in his own right in the northern suburbs. As mayor of Salisbury-I was fortunate enough to live in Salisbury for a while-he was a great mayor and a great defender of jobs and the culture in the northern suburbs. He was a great defender of the northern suburbs against some in the media. So it is understandable that he is in here defending the issue of Australians having a choice of Australian cars. When you get to the",249,Private Members Business
219,Mr Champion (Wakefield) (20:31,"We just heard a rather interesting speech from thebottom of this whole debate it is about whether or not Australian consumers are going to have an Australian choice when they go to the car yard to buy a car. Those opposite want to buy BMWs and Mercedes, let's be honest about it. They want Australians to be buying Hyundais and Great Walls. That is their future vision for Australian manufacturing. You only have to listen to the member for Mayo, and others, who talk about being played for fools by Detroit. What they really want to do is eliminate the Australian option. This is despite the great success story that is the Australian car industry. In the middle of the global financial crisis we got a second model at Holden's Elizabeth plant, the Holden Cruze. And everywhere you look Australians are buying this fantastic small car. And you still see the Commodore and the Holden Commodore ute. People want to buy them. They want that choice. The member for Makin talked about the sorts of extreme subsidies paid in other countries and the sorts of tariff arrangements in other countries. This is not a level playing field. It is a distorted market and we must compete in the real world, not in some fantasy world of a level playing field invented by pointy-headed economists and those opposite. It is a fiction. We must compete and we must provide assistance-co-assistance and co-investment-to ensure that we get the next model Commodore and Cruze and from this plant, which is worth two per cent of South Australia's gross state product and which employs 2,500 directly and thousands more in my state. Most importantly, you cannot imagine the town of Elizabeth without car manufacturing. Elizabeth is the town where I was born and I do not live too far from there now; I live in the city of Salisbury. But it is impossible to imagine Elizabeth without car manufacturing, it is impossible to imagine the South Australian economy without car manufacturing, and it is impossible to imagine this nation not manufacturing cars-just impossible. This is about patriotism. It is about an Australian consumer having the right to own and drive around in an Australian car built by Australian workers. Those opposite want us driving around in BMWs-well, I should correct myself: they want to drive around in BMWs. They want workers to be driving around in some garbage-some of the cheap imports coming in are poorly made rubbish in the main-and they want to outsource our car industry. That is what their plan is for this industry: they want to send it on a slow boat to China. This government intends to make sure that we keep building cars in this country, and that is why we will oppose the coalition's $500 million cut, which is just the beginning because as of 2015, and they have made this quite clear, it is a billion dollar cut. It is a billion dollar cut to send Australian jobs on a slow boat to China. Make no mistake about it, that is their policy. That is their intention. That is their commitment and that is what they will do if they are elected to office. (Time expired) Dr STONE (Murray) (20:36): I agree with the mover of this motion that the General Motors Holden plant in Elizabeth is an iconic South Australian industry directly employing around 2,500 people. I acknowledge the important contribution the General Motors Holden Elizabeth plant makes to the South Australian economy and the broader Australian manufacturing industry. But, at that point, I depart from simply acknowledging those facts in relation to the automotive industry. I want to draw the mover of the motion's attention to another iconic Australia industry that is being absolutely ignored by this government. I think we need to consider that other industry in the light of the support that is being given to automotive, because the problems of these two sectors are very similar. What are these problems? One of them is the costs of doing business in Australia, particularly the impending carbon tax, which will mean that any industry that is export exposed and energy intensive, like the car industry, is going to be looking at incredibly increased costs and loss of competitiveness. Then there is the daily increasing inflexibility of the Australian workforce. There are high labour costs in Australia, but in the past our productivity has made up for that. Unfortunately, with our productivity stalling and the inflexible workforce with the amazing union dominated conditions that now prevail in any workplace, the automotive industry is suffering. There is the surging dollar, and this government is refusing to pay attention to the incredible difficulties any exporter has with this unmanaged surging dollar. We have got skills shortages in this country and then we have a lack of local demand for local automotives compared to some other products being imported into Australia at much more competitive prices. What other sector has similar constraints and problems but is, in fact, much bigger than the iconic automotive industry in the value it delivers and the numbers it employs? Let us look at Australian agriculture. Let us look at food manufacturing. Australian farmers and allied sectors generate $133 billion a year in production, equating to 12.1 per cent of GDP. The gross value of Australian farm production at farm gate totals $41.8 billion a year. Australian farm exports earned the country $32.1 billion in 2008-09, representing 11.9 per cent of total exports and 14.7 per cent of all Australian merchandise exports-and that was in drought years. Australian agriculture is an Australian icon, just like automotive. It supports the jobs of 359,900 other Australians. These jobs are in farming and related industries across our cities and our regions. Like the automotive industry, agriculture is a real job multiplier. Farmers occupy and manage 54 per cent of Australia's land mass and they are on the frontline of delivering environmental outcomes on behalf of the broader community. Australian farmers spent $3 billion on natural resource management over 2006-07. They manage weeds and look after the soil and the land mass, native vegetation and so on. Australian primary industries have led the nation in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by a massive 40 per cent between 1990 and 2006. So what I am saying to the mover of this motion is how come automotive is getting this beaut helping hand from the Australian governmentMr Georganas: Because it provides jobs. Dr STONE: I think I just identified how many jobs are provided by agriculture. You cannot compare the two. If agriculture, like the iconic South Australian General Motors Holden plant, is also creating jobs and battling to stay competitive with the high cost of wages, high energy costs, the high dollar and the difficulties with workplace relations right now, I just ask for a level playing field. I just say hang on, take the blinkers off. I know not many rural people vote Labor-in fact very few-but that should not be the governing principle behind who identifies where the needs are and who does not. Of course the South Australian General Motors Holden industry is an icon-most people who are more than half a century old have had a Holden at some stage during their lifetime. But we also have agriculture and we want to eat Australian food in the future, so I ask this government to get a life, look beyond South Australian marginal seats and understand that there are other icons that deserve some attention. Murray's speech, indicating that she does not support the automotive industry. We know that when agriculture has droughts and floods and when there are important issues facing the agriculture industry, governments of all persuasions always provide assistance. We know that for a fact-it happened in the floods last year and it has happened in droughts-so it is absolutely absurd for the member for Murray to talk about providing assistance to the automotive industry, which provides jobs for blue-collar workers who live in the cities, who cannot afford to buy land and who cannot go out and start an agricultural business. This industry provides jobs for thousands of people in my electorate, in the electorate of the member for Makin, in the electorate of the member for Chifley and in the electorate of the member for La Trobe. These jobs provide income for people to pay their mortgages, to send their children to school and to ensure that they have the ability to progress themselves in life. We know that farmers do produce a lot of our trade, and they have my support. But to turn around and say that the automotive industry does not require supportDr Stone: I didn't say that. asked why was it that the agriculture industry did not get support-but they do get support. In bad times, like in droughts and floods, all governments, Liberal and Labor, provide funding to assist agricultural industries. I speak in favour of the Australian automotive industry, including the iconic brands and the models that have been produced in South Australia by Holden over many years. I say this because I have first-hand experience. The first-hand experience I have is that my father migrated to this country in 1954. He came off a ship in Port Melbourne and on the second day of his arrival he went to Fishermans Bend and landed a job with General Motors-Holden's. He stayed there until 1979. He was able to earn a living and ensure that his family was looked after. He worked on a production line in very bad conditions in those days. Regardless of what the conditions were like, it provided a living for many thousands of people in this country. The Australian automotive industry continues to employ thousands of Australians in our electorates all over the country. These jobs are required in all facets of car production, from design right through to the production line and exporting, benefiting the livelihoods of many tens of thousands of Australians across the country. I speak in favour of the proud role of this government, our Labor government, and that of previous Labor governments that recognised the importance of this industry-and it is an important industry. It employs thousands of people across the country in every single seat, even in rural seats. This industry has invested in making itself a success story over many, many years and has a strong prospect of continuing the wealth generation of this country for years to come. I just gave you a brief example of my own connection to the automotive industry. It is said that there are some 46,000 Australians employed in car manufacturing around the nation today and another 200,000 Australians that are reliant on this industry continuing in Australia. Within South Australia, where General Motors Holden has its Elizabeth plant, there are some",251,Private Members Business

221,Mr Georganas,"The member for Murray used the example of the two industries and2,700 people directly employed at this site, supporting over 5½ thousand other jobs-and I am being very conservative in those figures-in the manufacturing of the components used by Holden in the building of cars on that site. This is not an insubstantial industry, this is not an insubstantial workforce, but it is a highly competitive industry which many countries find difficult to sustain. Australia is only one of 13 nations across the globe which has all the skills that are required in manufacturing a motor vehicle. It has all the roles, all the jobs here to produce 21st century automobiles. This is a skill set that we value on this side of the parliament. This is a strategic position that Labor sees as important for Australia to defend and to maintain, unlike those on the other side-and we heard the vitriol from the member opposite earlier. Towards this end Labor governments will continue to assist this industry, and I am very proud that this industry will be assisted by this Labor government. (Time expired) moved by my colleague the member for Makin-not, obviously, as a South Australian MP but recognising that we share an interest, as a number of us do on this side, in the future of manufacturing in this country. The electorate of Chifley relies more on the manufacturing sector to provide jobs for local residents than many other electorates around Australia, and just as many as my colleagues here. The latest available census statistics show that over 10,000 people who live in Chifley are employed in manufacturing, accounting for about 16 per cent of total employment. That is considerably higher than the 10.6 per cent average across Australia. As the Australian economy grows it must do so in a way that includes and supports a vibrant manufacturing sector. Holden-and for that matter Ford and Toyota-are crucial to sustaining manufacturing in this country. The sector itself, as has been reflected on, employs around 46,000 people and another 200,000 people in related manufacturing and service sectors. It consumes-and this is a staggering amount-$1.3 billion in locally manufactured iron and steel, $440 million in polymer products and $157 million in chemicals. And while much has been made of the extent of government assistance to the sector, automotive manufacturing contributes significantly to the overall economy. Holden employs almost 5,000 people, each of whom contributes to the economy through their own taxation and spending. Holden itself estimates that it pays more than $40 million a year in income tax, $2.1 million in fringe benefits tax, $17½ million in payroll tax and $2.1 million a year in property tax. This is a sizeable contribution by this firm. Australia is only one of 13 countries in the world capable of producing a car from design through R&D to assembly. It is imperative that we hang on to that capability, because it is inherently linked to our ability to innovate. Labor invests in the car industry through programs aimed at improving productivity, global competitiveness and clean technology. During the height of the GFC Labor kept the automotive industry afloat through the $5.4 billion New Car Plan for a Greener Future. It is something that I am proud of; it is something a lot of government members are proud of. Compare that with what the member for Warringah, the Leader of the Opposition, would do. He would cut $1.5 billion in future support from the industry when it needs it most. What does that do to confidence in future policy settings? This policy is not universally accepted in coalition ranks. I understand that there are many members opposite who voice their concerns about what the coalition is proposing to do. The",254,Private Members Business
222,Mr Husic (Chifley,"Government Whip) (20:47): I rise to speak in favour of the motionopposition's policy will make it impossible to attract new investment in vehicle models and will put an end to the process of R&D and capital acquisition, the development and adoption of new technologies and the creation of more jobs in the industry. The Prime Minister has given the assurance that, while ever Labor is here, we will be making cars in Australia. Those opposite make a big deal about the level of industry assistance we are providing, but I would remind them that this is a global industry and we do need to look at what other governments around the world are doing to support their sectors. Australia has a five per cent tariff imposed on passenger motor vehicles and parts, and that is the third lowest in the autoproducing world. Tariffs in the EU and the UK stand at 10 per cent, compared with our level; in China, 25 per cent; and in India, 60 per cent. Research by the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries has found that Aussie car makers are receiving less than $20 per person in government support. In the UK it is $25 per person; in the US, $250 per person; and in Sweden, as much as $350 per person. That is a huge difference, as reflected on by my colleague the member for Hindmarsh. When Holden's parent company, General Motors, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009, the United States government purchased a 60 per cent stake in the new GM company. During this time, GM Holden continued to stand on its own two feet, without any support from its parent company, and that is a sign of its economic health. The local automotive industry is facing some significant challenges at present, which will exist for some time. On the face of those challenges, such as the high dollar, the rising cost of input materials and the collapse of consumer sales in major export markets hit by the GFC, the last thing we need to do is remove support and say to the 46,000 workers in this sector that they are not valued. Debate adjourned. Debate resumed. That grievances be noted. Workplace Relations the rule of law, free to allow business innovation and free from the excesses of government intervention has been the cornerstone of more than half a century of Liberal thinking by prime ministers Menzies, Holt, Gorton, McMahon, Fraser and Howard. Menzies best set out the Liberal Party's philosophical genesis on this in his reflections in Afternoon Light. He made the following points: Socialism means high costs, inefficiency, the constant intrusion of political considerations, the damping down of enterprise, the overlordship of routine. None of these elements can produce progress, and without progress security will turn out to be a delusion. These views did not represent a belief that private enterprise should have an 'open go'. Menzies recognised the responsibilities of the state to provide social and economic safeguards. Through the prime ministerships of six Liberal leaders these principles have remained consistent while being appropriate in their flexibility to allow for the contemporary time and history those prime ministers governed.",255,Private Members Business
223,The Deputy Speaker (Ms S Bird) (20:52,The question is:,256,Grievance Debate
224,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (20:52,"Industrial relations policy that is fair, bound byToday, I want to outline the following areas where I believe Australia desperately needs industrial relations reform. These reforms are essential to productivity, international competitiveness and the Australian concept of a fair go. Whilst in the midst of an unprecedented moment in the political history of this nation, we still face daily challenges that demand our immediate attention. To not redress the inadequacies of current policies is to hold Australia back for longer and prevent us from fulfilling our potential as a nation sooner. In 2010, the coalition put out the call to business to speak up and voice their concerns on Labor's IR laws. My colleague the member for North Sydney said he thought it was hugely important that members of the business community engage more directly in the policy debates that will shape Australia's economic future. Mr Hockey said in the Australian: The squeaky voice will get the oil in this parliament and we need advocates for mainstream change to balance against sectorial interests. He also made a point of backing the right of his coalition colleagues to debate changes to Labor's work laws to boost productivity. He said: People are entitled to their views and I would be disappointed if colleagues were afraid to debate significant policy issues. Well, the squeaky wheel has spoken. It spoke up in the same article, with comments by Michael Chaney as Chairman of the National Australia Bank and Woodside Petroleum. It has since spoken up, with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and other peak industry groups representing their members' businesses and every day since it has pleaded, with phone calls, letters and emails from small business operators nationwide, imploring federal members of parliament on all sides of this House to stand up and do something on behalf of people who do the right thing by the law and by their employees in this country and who ask only for a fair go in return. Australian industrial relations reform is stuck in a stagnant policy quagmire on both sides of politics. The government have been derelict in their duty to present responsible legislation. Instead, the Gillard government has been so regressive in its arcane attitude towards a modern-day, globally responsive and flexible Australian workplace. The attitudes of the Hawke and Keating governments towards necessary reform would be a welcome breath of fresh air in today's parliament. It is essential that, as a matter of priority, the Liberal Party articulate a clear policy position on industrial relations. People are crying out with ears primed and bated breath for an alternative that takes account of global and modern times, that is forward thinking and outward looking and that, in essence, is fair and reasonable. Australians have seen what they do not want. They are now desperately waiting to hear something that our nation does need. Among a number of truly concerning actions brought to and decided by Fair Work Australia, we only need to glance back several short months to the recent action brought against Qantas. Like so many disputes under the current Labor regime the issue was the cause of the dispute, not the quick solution that eventually came at the end of that notorious weekend at Fair Work Australia. The government fairly quickly claimed credit for praise it was not due at the conclusion of that dispute. It had asked Fair Work to intervene, knowing that irrespective of whether the outcome was to reject Qantas's action or suspend it, there would be a 21-day period for a resolution, after which Fair Work could mandate a solution. This incident just about brought the nation, via stranded passengers, a national carrier in turmoil and the rest of Australian business and industry at the whim of the Transport Workers Union, to its knees. It would be in this dark shadow that the coalition should be basing its response for a fair, workable and modern approach to workplace relations fairly, clearly and unbowed by the regressive union reactionaries, desperate to maintain the control they have wrested since 2010. While the government branded Qantas's behaviour during this time as 'militant and extreme' and threw about lines such as 'industrial terrorism', it was Qantas that gained widespread but ginger support from business and industry for its last-resort action. Australian industry empathised with Qantas because they were hamstrung by the same IR laws that Qantas had shackled around its neck, as well. Australian industry are desperate for an Australian government that understands the modern Australian workplace, that is moderate and empathetic with both employees and employers, and is not afraid to make hard decisions amid Labor hysteria where it is in the Australian national interest. Paul Kelly noted in the Australian during this dispute that the Fair Work legislation had shifted industrial relations in three ways in this country. 'First, the statutory power is now with unions, not the employer, and individual contracts are banned. Second, the new law means bargaining is more about rights and disputes are longer. Even Qantas held this line publically during its dispute-it was out there every day affirming the point that the dispute was not about money; rather it was about management control between Qantas and the unions. Three, the law stifles productivity gains in a globalised market, especially for a company like Qantas, which is competing against international companies who have more flexibility to run more efficient business models.' With the Qantas case looming as a foreboding reason for why change is needed, I want to set out the areas in which I believe change is most warranted. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has undertaken significant policy work in this area because it recognises the costs at stake. Industry groups like ACCI are at the coalface of small and large businesses approaching them on a daily basis, desperate to seek a better answer than what the current government is providing, but unsure about what the alternatives provide. ACCI and other industry representatives have been clear about their concern on the current set of problems besetting industrial relations policy in this country. I share their concern. I want to lay out the following areas that demand redress. Despite significant reforms under the previous and current governments, Australia still has excessive award regulation. This includes the transition to modern awards. The federal government deserves recognition for reducing the number of awards but should not be complacent about the fact that problems remain-for example, the traditional hours of nine to five for the services industry do not address their modern-day working requirements. Penalty rates, particularly for sectors with most of their busy periods falling on weekends, are not being addressed sufficiently by government. I heard Martin Ferguson speak on exactly the same thing a few weeks ago. There is also huge frustration from small and medium businesses about labour cost rises flowing from modern awards. The government has reneged on its 2007 promise not to increase these costs. The impact has been exacerbated by the fact that the penalty rates rise was due to a reorganisation of regulation and not because of a merit based review of penalty rates in the services industry by Fair Work Australia. I again call upon the government to commit to merit based hearings. The government has been preoccupied with assuming that a one-size-fits-all approach is a workable situation for business, regardless of whether they are a mum-and-dad corner milk bar or a listed Australian company like Telstra. The fact is that this is not a tenable situation and small business is crying out for recourse. Flexibility and employer discretion are two concepts missing from the government's existing framework of Fair Work Australia, and this is something that has come to the fore in the Qantas depute as well as from bodies like ACCI. ACCI notes that the collective bargaining emphasis on the fair work laws is out of step with the workforce in the private sector, which is only 14 per cent unionised-and it is hard to argue with the facts on that. Being practical for a moment, collective bargaining for small and medium-size employers is just not reasonable, and most of their workforce either has a tiny proportion of unionised members or, more commonly, none at all. These employers do not deal with staff employment in a collective manner anyway. In my own small business, we dealt with our staff fairly and on an individual basis, and they in turn appreciated being recognised and rewarded for the unique skills and enthusiasm they brought to their work. In the limited time. I have tonight I want to implore all sides of this place to revisit the following areas which desperately require our better efforts: one, we should recognise the failure of the individual flexible agreements to provide an effective alternative to industry wide rules. Again, the application of this assumes that the mum-and-dad milk bar has the same workplace structure as an ASX listed corporation; and, two, we must have regard for the fact that individual agreements need to work in practice, not just theory. This requires two ingredients. Agreements should contain a no-disadvantage clause. I will repeat that: agreements should contain a no-disadvantage clause. I am completely committed to ensuring that employees are no worse off during any revisiting of this or other IR issues. Individual agreements are not a magic bullet; they are one part of a broader approach to helping to improve reward for effort and fairness for employees and employers alike in a modern global economy. It is no secret that collective bargaining is too bogged down in a process-intensive framework that is not delivering results for employees or employers. Businesses are knocking our doors down to make the point that protective industrial action is no longer seen as a last-resort option and is instead now seen by unions as just one tool in a kit box of bargaining options. We need only look at any number of current disputes to see this. Instead, the concept of genuinely trying to reach an agreement should mean just that. The framework is not really promoting good bargaining and agreement making outcomes. It is just increasing an already adversarial contest with more weapons drawn. There is a real concern among business about the size of wage outcomes, especially when linked to productivity gains that lag significantly behind. The example of the increase in the wages of the(Time expired) Gillard Government Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (21:02): One of the frustrating things about being part of the current government-one that has so many achievements in an electorate like mine where there is very little local media-is actually telling the story of some of the more complex tasks that the government has undertaken, the ones that do not translate well to short grabs or small flyers. I am going to talk about just some of the things that we have delivered in the last four years, particularly in relation to my electorate. When we came to government in 2007 university enrolments in Parramatta were lagging behind the rest of Sydney. People in Western Sydney enrolled in university at around three per cent of the population, compared to 5.2 per cent Sydney wide. That clearly was not good enough, but what was particularly distressing about those figures was that in the 10 years previous to us winning government in 2007 the enrolment rates for people from disadvantaged communities and Indigenous communities actually dropped, and the gap between Sydney and Western Sydney actually broadened over that decade. When we came to government in 2007 we made a commitment that by 2020 the government would have 20 per cent of undergraduate enrolments from people from lowsocioeconomic-status backgrounds, and we set about trying to achieve that. We are providing $749 million to improve access to undergraduate courses for people from low-socioeconomicstatus backgrounds as well as improving the retention and completion rates for those students. Universities and schools in my community have been setting about trying to improve those numbers, and I am pleased to say that since 2009 the number of university enrolments by disadvantaged students has increased by nearly 13 per cent-again, a great achievement that gets very little coverage. We also had a big improvement in high school attainments. The high school retention rate grew from about 30 per cent in the eighties to reach the high 70s by about 2001, but it largely stagnated there. That is not good enough, considering the need for highly skilled workers in our community and the disadvantage that a person faces if they do not graduate from high school. When we came to office nearly 25 per cent of people in Western Sydney were not graduating from high school, so we made a commitment with COAG that 90 per cent of young people aged 20 to 24 will have a year 12 or equivalent qualification by 2015. Nationally, participation in education and training increased by 5.6 per cent between 2008 and 2010, and we currently sit at around 85 per cent attainment-again, a great improvement. As far as the health system is concerned, it could only be described as a hotchpotch of policies when we were elected in 2007. Huge tracts of the country could not get adequate services, and poor distribution of services was literally costing lives. It was a shocking fact that, with some cancers, you were three times more likely to die if you were diagnosed in a regional or remote area than if you were diagnosed in a city. That is a shocking fact that should not have been acceptable to any government. Your chances of surviving cancer depended as much on your postcode as anything else. The further away you were from a capital city, the worse your prognosis was. So we decided the best solution was to radically improve treatment options for patients. We decided to build an Australia wide network of regional cancer centres, announced in the 201011 budgets. Today, 24 projects are in planning or under construction across the country. These centres will serve a catchment area of well over seven million people. They will provide 7,600 additional radiotherapy treatments and over 127,000 additional chemotherapy treatments each year, along with 180 accommodation beds. Western Sydney has some of the largest and busiest hospitals in the country. Westmead Hospital, in my electorate, is the largest medical campus in the Southern Hemisphere. But, when we came to government in 2007, there was an urgent need for more beds and increased funding for elective surgery and emergency departments. We have delivered 232 new subacute beds, of which 152 are already operational, and $20 million in additional funding for surgery and emergency departments. When we came to government there were widespread shortages of doctors across the country, but particularly in Western Sydney. Last year the Prime Minister opened the University of Western Sydney Blacktown/Mt Druitt Clinical School, which benefited from over $20 million of Commonwealth funding. Six years ago there were no medical students in Blacktown or Mt Druitt; next year there will be 150. There will also be a second clinical school, at Nepean, next year, so Western Sydney will have two medical clinical schools, just a few short years after Labor came to office. The number of GP training places in Western Sydney has increased by 50 per cent. There are now 65 GP registrars, 38 junior doctors in general practice, and 14 additional Commonwealth funded specialists in training in my area. The number of Commonwealth funded medical specialist training posts in Western Sydney has increased by 62 per cent. There are extra nursing places, with 290 more nurses in training at the University of Western Sydney in 2010 than there were three years prior. We are also delivering infrastructure, with $189 million going into hospital infrastructure, including in Nepean and Liverpool. In the area of skills generally, there were widespread skill shortages across the country and in my area when we came to office. There had been rapid growth in some areas, and a lack of response by the previous government had left significant shortages. There were many warnings by the Reserve Bank and by businesses both big and small about the need to address this. We immediately made record investment in training to build a high-skilled workforce and boost productivity, with more than $11.1 billion in total skills funding in the three years from 2008 to 2011. That is an increase of almost 55 per cent compared to the former government's investment over an equivalent period. We also put more young people into training. Apprenticeship and traineeship numbers have soared. The number was up to 460,000 in March last year, the highest level ever recorded. We have also given more people the opportunity to gain qualifications than ever before, with a 23 per cent increase in numbers since 2007. For higher level qualifications, the increase was greater-the number was 27 per cent greater in 2009 than in 2007. In 2010, almost 140,000 students who already had degree-level qualifications were in VET. That number is up 38 per cent since 2007. We have also given better access to education for diverse groups. In 2010, there were 83,000 VET students who identified as Indigenous-up 17 per cent from 2007. There are 110,00 students who identify as having a disability-an increase of eight per cent. And there are 271,000 students from non-English-speaking backgrounds-an increase of 17.6 per cent. Again, we have not ignored our regional friends. We have invested in education and skills with $500 million from the Education Investment Fund for regional universities and TAFEs and an extra $110 million to recognise the additional costs incurred by regional universities. On the issue of families with children who were struggling to find child care, you might remember that between 2004 and 2007 there was an acute shortage in child care. The percentage of family income spent on childcare fees was a whopping 13 per cent in 2004, and rebates came not at the end of the year that you were in but at the end of the next tax year. Through substantial reform we have managed to reduce the percentage of family income spent on child care from 13 per cent to 7.5 per cent over the four years that we have governed so far. So $14.9 billion-that is nearly $15 billion-now goes into the pockets of families through the childcare benefit and the childcare rebate. We did that by increasing the rebate from 30 to 50 per cent for out-of-pocket expenses and by increasing the limit from $4,354 to $7,000. That has helped 735,000 Australian families since 1 July 2008. Parents can now have the rebate paid fortnightly if they choose, which helps them with their fortnightly bills. We have also provided additional assistance to 640,000 lowand middle-income families each year through the childcare benefit. A low-income family using full-time child care now has around 80 per cent of their childcare fees covered. I am also particularly pleased that we acted very early on for parents with children with disabilities. The $147 million Better Start for Children with Disability initiative allows children to access a range of early intervention services, including speech pathologists, audiologists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, orthoptists and psychologists. We all knew when we came to government that we needed to do much more for people with disabilities. I am pleased to say that focusing initially on early intervention where most of the difference would be made has over four years impacted on around 9,000 young people with cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome and moderate or severe hearing impairments. These are all extraordinary achievements that get very little coverage-but achievements of which I am very proud. (Time expired) Superannuation cosy relationship between the union movement and a certain class of superannuation funds, particularly industry funds and public sector funds. I rise tonight to speak more specifically about the Energy Industries Superannuation Scheme, a public sector scheme in New South Wales, and the cluster of business entities associated with EISS. EISS is the retirement scheme for people working in the electricity sector in New South Wales and it manages assets worth approximately $3 billion. The assets of EISS include a one-third stake in a company called Chifley Financial Services Ltd and full ownership of another company called FuturePlus Financial Services Pty Ltd. The trustee company of EISS has eight directors. These are the people who exercise control of EISS and its assets. These directors include a range of New South Wales ALP and union movement royalty: Mr Bernie Riordan, secretary of the New South Wales Electrical Trades Union and a former president of the ALP in New South Wales; Mr John Whelan, a former president of Unions NSW; Mr Mick Doust of the ETU; Mr Ian Tarrant of the United Services Union. Mr Riordan and Mr Whelan are also directors of FuturePlus Financial Services and were until recently also directors of Chifley Financial Services.",256,Grievance Debate
225,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield) (21:12,"I have spoken previously in this place about theThe Sunday Telegraph reported last year that Mr Riordan was at that point receiving directors' fees from the three entities-EISS, Chifley and FuturePlus-totalling around $155,000 a year. A statement of claim filed in the Federal Court last year alleged Mr Riordan had received $1,807,884 in fees since 1998 from sitting on the boards of EISS, FuturePlus Financial Services, Chifley Financial Services and Mert Ltd. The statement was filed by Dean Mighell, secretary of the Victorian branch of the ETU. Chifley Financial Services, according to its website, was established by Unions NSW in 1991. This was at the time compulsory superannuation arrangements were first commencing and presumably Unions NSW saw a way to obtain an advantage from these arrangements. In 2010, Unions NSW owned one-third of Chifley, EISS another third, and the last third was held by the Local Government Superannuation Scheme. In that year Chifley paid a total dividend exceeding $5 million split three ways between Unions NSW, EISS and the Local Government Superannuation Scheme. Subsequently, there have been changes in the ownership of Chifley and one-third of the company is now owned by the Australian Workers Union. Chifley is the trustee of a public office superannuation fund called FuturePlus Super. There are complex arrangements between EISS, Chifley, FuturePlus Financial Services and FuturePlus Super. FuturePlus Super paid Chifley a fee of $3.5 million in the most recent reported year for acting as trustee. These arrangements in my view raise a number of important questions. Firstly, what is the basis on which those charged with carriage of EISS-the directors including Mr Riordan and owned by EISS? Remember that the assets of EISS are there for the sole purpose of providing benefits to members of the fund on their retirement and certain related and ancillary purposes under section 62 of the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act. Therefore, the initial decision to invest in FuturePlus must meet this test, so must the decision recently taken by directors to acquire from the Local Government Superannuation Scheme a further 50 per cent interest in FuturePlus so that EISS now holds 100 per cent of FuturePlus. In considering whether this is a good investment, it is relevant to note that FuturePlus's 2011 annual financial statements show a loss of $1.6 million and contain a warning that says: 'A significant volume of the company's revenues arise from administration serviced through superannuation funds.' In other words, the customer base is far from diversified exposing the company to risk if it loses a customer. Secondly, what do the directors of EISS intend to do in response to last year's finding by the NSW Attorney-General that said: The Energy Industries Superannuation Scheme is exposed to significant risk resulting from major changes to its administrator, FuturePlus. EISS may need to provide funding to FuturePlus to support infrastructure investments to comply with the proposed Stronger Super regulatory reform Thirdly, what is the basis on which the directors of EISS decided that Chifley Financial Services was an appropriate company to invest in? Its website says: Because of our unique history and ownership, Chifley’s primary business driver is not profit, but respect for the needs of all our clients. That is all very well, but the job of the directors of EISS is to maximise the retirement benefits of members of the scheme. EISS members might reasonably wonder whether EISS",262,Grievance Debate
226,Mr Whelan,"have decided that FuturePlus Financial Services is an appropriate asset to beshould not exit its investment in Chifley and reinvest the money in a company which is focused on profit. Fourthly, what was basis on which EISS first chose to acquire a stake in Chifley following its original 100 per cent ownership by Unions NSW? Was this decision influenced by the close ties of at least some of the directors with Unions NSW, given that it presumably involved a cash payment to Unions NSW using money, but beneficially belonging to the members of the EISS? Fifthly, the FuturePlus Super fund, of which Chifley is the trustee, had $428 million of gross assets at 30 June 2010. The fund paid Chifley fees of almost $3.3 million in that year. In turn, most of these assets are invested in another entity-Chifley Investment Fund. The responsible end of that fund is Chifley Financial Services Pty Ltd and it charged that fund an annual fee in 2010 of almost $1.6 million. Why has this complex multilayered structure been chosen and, as a result, are the total effective fees being charged to members of FuturePlus Super higher than they need to be? Sixthly, in view of the rhetoric appearing on the Chifley website, is it possible that members of FuturePlus may think they are members of an industry fund rather than a fund operating effectively on a for-profit basis? Seventhly, were the arrangements under which Chifley was appointed as trustee of FuturePlus Super, and FuturePlus Financial Services was appointed to provide administration services to EISS, subject to a competitive market process to test whether the members of these funds were getting the best possible value? Given the potential for conflict of interest, was this process conducted at arm's length and did directors with the potential conflict absent themselves from decision making or at the very least declare their interest. The issue of conflict of interest was raised by the recent Cooper review into superannuation, which said: The identification and management of conflicts of interests and of duties are a particular priority. ……… it is clear from the Review’s analysis that there is a need for greater clarity of what is required of superannuation fund trustees and trustee‐directors in this regard. Eighthly, what is the basis on which directors appointed by EISS vote on decisions facing the boards of Chifley and FuturePlus given the general law as to the directors' duties is clear that a director must act in the best interests of the company of which he or she is a director, not in the best interests of the company which appointed him or her? Ninthly, can members of EISS be satisfied that their directors have appropriate skills and qualifications to manage a $2 billion-plus investment portfolio? How does a background as a union official equip somebody to carry out this specialised and critical function? This issue is rife throughout public sector and industry superannuation funds, where directors are typically appointed by sponsor organisations. Evidently, in the case of the EISS the sponsor organisation was the New South Wales ALP. This issue too was raised by the Cooper review: Contemporary best practice in corporate governance for listed companies includes the presence of independent directors on the board. The panel believes that a minimum number of non-associated trustee directors such that they can genuinely influence the decisions of those boards should be required on all superannuation trustee boards. Unfortunately, as Assistant Treasurer, Bill Shorten did very little in response. Why is the government hastening so slowly on this issue? Why has it not been included in the present Productivity Commission inquiry into the My Super arrangements? Is it because it suits the union movement very well that industry and public sector superannuation funds typically involve large number of well-paid directorships divvied up amongst the union mates, whether or not they trouser the director fees personally or pay them into the union coffers? Is it because the AWU, of which Minister Shorten is a former national secretary, has a strong vested issue in this industry, not least as the one-third owner of Chifley Financial Services? The arrangement here is one which is not unusual amongst public sector and industry superannuation funds, particularly in the use of assets of the fund beneficially owned by the fund members to acquire or establish companies delivering specific financial, administrative or other services to members of the fund or other superannuation funds. Superannuation funds are supposed to have the sole purpose of being a vehicle to accumulate and disperse the retirement savings of members. They are not supposed to be a vehicle used by a board heavy with union and ALP officials to build up a cluster of investments in firms offering financial planning, funds administration and other services, which in term become, firstly, a means to generate profits and stream them through to unions and union peak bodies and, secondly, a means to create additional boards in multilevel structures, allowing those officials to maximise their opportunities to collect directors fees. I call upon the minister, Bill Shorten, and the regulator, APRA, to look carefully at these arrangements to satisfy themselves and, in turn, the Australian people that the sole purpose test in the superannuation legislation is being met and that investment decisions concerning the EISS assets are being taken for the sole purpose of delivering retirement and incidental benefits to EISS members and not for the purpose of increasing the economic power and financial well-being of union officials and the unions they control. Central Queensland University Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (21:22): I want to use the first part of my grievance debate speech not to grieve but to praise. I want to praise my local university, Central Queensland University, for the leadership role it has assumed in our region in recent times and the fact that it has matched that leadership and vision with an impressive record of investment that will create a legacy for generations of Central Queenslanders. The commitment of the university to our region and its desire to be an active partner in our growth and evolution into an economic powerhouse is best demonstrated by its most far-reaching proposal, and that is to merge with the CQ Institute of TAFE to become a dual sector institution. This proposal comes out of the recognition that Central Queensland, the cities of Gladstone, Rockhampton and Mackay and the communities of the Bowen Basin are experiencing never before seen levels of economic activity in the resources and energy sectors. That of course is creating unique demands for skilled workers across a staggering range of disciplines and occupations. Education and training in Central Queensland needs to meet that challenge, and CQ University wants to seize that opportunity. Now for the grievance. Late last year, a major precondition to the merger of CQ University and CQ Institute of TAFE, the creation of Queensland's first dual sector institution and a landmark for our region, fell into place. After a lot of hard work on the part of the university and lobbying from me, the university secured $73.8 million from the government's structural adjustment fund to make the dual sector dream a reality. The funding will go towards a state of-the-art engineering precinct at the uni's Mackay campus, together with an upgrade of the existing TAFE facility in the centre of Mackay. It includes an allied health clinic in Rockhampton and a number of other vital projects to bring about the effective integration of the two institutions into one. In a ringing endorsement of the dual sector proposal and in recognition of the significance to our region of this bold reform, the Commonwealth government allocated to our local university an incredible one-fifth of the total funding available-that is, $73.8 million from a total fund of $377 million. That is not a bad effort and one that CQU can be proud of. This is now at risk, thanks to the dithering of the LNP in Queensland and of its leader, Campbell Newman. Running in parallel to the Commonwealth's funding process, the university has been engaged for some time with the state government to satisfy its due diligence requirements ahead of the merger. This is a process at arm's length from the political sphere that is being carried out by the relevant state government departments. Not surprisingly, the university has been closely involved, providing information to the bureaucracy to assist with that study. It is my understanding that the finishing touches are being put on the due diligence review and that its findings are expected to be available to the incoming state government sometime before the end of April. The conclusions of that due diligence review need to be put to the Queensland cabinet for consideration and sign-off before the merger can proceed any further, which means before any of the Commonwealth's $73.8 million can be released. Timing is everything here. This issue needs to be the first order of cabinet business for whoever leads Queensland after 24 March. Campbell must commit now to this project, or we risk losing $73.8 million in Commonwealth funding for our Central Queensland University. Central Queensland students and businesses will miss out unless Labor is re-elected or Mr Newman comes to his senses. I am working as hard as I can to keep the federal minister informed of the situation and to find a way through, but there is no getting away from the fact that the Commonwealth funding is there to bring together two institutions, one of which is a state government entity. The attitude of the Queensland government is fundamental to this merger, to this potential powerhouse of learning, research and skills development, getting off the ground. The outcome of the coming state election is shaping as crucial to this important initiative, which I believe will define our region in years to come. I say that because we have two parties competing for leadership of our state which, apparently, have two very different attitudes to this project. On the one hand, we have the Labor Party led by Anna Bligh, who has left the people of Central Queensland in no doubt that she sees the creation of Queensland's first dual sector university as a step forward for our region, one that she wants to be part of. The merger will produce an institution capable of providing opportunities for local people to get the educational foothold they need to be part of our region's growth and prosperity. She also recognises that it will meet the demands of industry right across the board, filling the shortages that threaten to hold us back, whether it be in mining, LNG, agriculture or health, business or IT. Anna Bligh has embraced this project and pledged her full support for it should she become Premier after 24 March. We can be confident that she will move heaven and earth to have the due diligence report before cabinet as a matter of priority, which is what is needed for milestones to be met and for federal government funds to flow. On the other hand, we have the LNP and its leader, Campbell Newman, showing a disturbing lack of commitment to the merger. I do not think anyone can get Campbell Newman to even talk about the project, and the shadow minister he has sent out to comment on the issue has everyone who cares about education and training and the future of Central Queensland terrified, frankly, by his stumbling response to questions. In one article he was quoted as saying: I am not signing an open cheque book for them. That is the point everyone is making. We are not asking Ted Malone to sign a cheque for anyone. We are begging him not to throw away $74 million that has already been offered. Here is something that the university and TAFE have been working on for at least two years. It has the backing of the federal government, the current Premier and community and business leaders across Central Queensland. We can all see the enormous value and potential of this project. Sadly, we can also see it slipping away, together with $74 million of investment by the Commonwealth government, because Campbell Newman wants to stay a small target and slide his way into power without having to reveal what that really means for Queensland. I have spent too long backing CQU on this project, fought too hard to get that money in a very competitive process, as I am sure members here would appreciate, to let Campbell Newman get away with treating CQU like that and treating Central Queensland like that. Campbell Newman has to commit to this project and he has to do it now. His shadow minister, Ted Malone, told the people of Rockhampton in Saturday's Morning Bulletin that there are no guarantees with this. Well, what are they waiting for? The shadow minister is hiding behind vague cop-outs like the need for further investigation into TAFE and needing to know where we are going with TAFE. What has the shadow minister been doing for the last three years? We are now two weeks into the election. Hasn't he developed some policy on TAFE and training? Wouldn't he have already taken some passing interest in the merger of CQU and CQ TAFE-a major reform that has been under active consideration and development for most of his term on the front bench, and, I might say, a reform that has a direct bearing on his electorate? He says the LNP need to know where they are going with TAFE. Well, aren't the people of Queensland entitled to know, two weeks into an election, where the LNP are going on TAFE? And aren't the people of Central Queensland entitled to know where the LNP is going on this important project after CQ University and CQ Institute of TAFE? Mr Newman has to do better than that if he is going to convince the people of our part of Queensland and other regional areas that he can be more than the mayor of Brisbane. For the LNP to be so disinterested and reckless about a project of such significance to our region says to me that Campbell Newman does not even know we exist. We have the commitment from Anna Bligh that dealing with the due diligence report on this project will be a first-order priority for a Labor government if re-elected. The people of Central Queensland expect and deserve no less from Campbell Newman, and he should commit now. Australia Post that is of concern to residents and businesses in the Robina area. That is the unilateral decision by Australia Post to close the mail delivery centre adjacent to Robina Village and relocate over 1,000 post office boxes approximately four kilometres to Robina Town Centre.",263,Grievance Debate
227,Mrs Andrews (Mcpherson) (21:31,"TodayI rise to speak about an important issueAustralia Post has already closed one retail post office on the southern Gold Coast, the local post office at Palm Beach. Australia Post took this action despite an outcry from local businesses and residents, many of whom were older citizens and/or had a disability. Australia Post plans to close the Robina delivery centre and relocate post offices over the weekend of 2 and 3 June this year. Post office box holders were advised of this plan on 14 July this year via a customer notice placed into their post office boxes by Australia Post. I was subsequently advised by Australia Post officially the following day, 15 February, by letter, after my office had contacted Australia Post after being alerted to the pending closure by a local shop owner. Local businesses in the area had heard rumours for some time that changes were to be made, but I understand that there was no advice from Australia Post until 14 February. As you can imagine, this was very unsettling for local businesses and post office box holders as they were dependent on rumour to try and make decisions about mail delivery and services. There will be approximately 727 customers who will be directly affected by the relocation of the post office boxes. However, there are over 1,000 postboxes in total that will be relocated. Australia Post has indicated that the proposed new location of these post office boxes is 2.5 kilometres away from the current location. That may be so as the crow flies, but if you are driving or walking the distance is more like four kilometres. The closure of the Robina delivery centre and relocation of post office boxes will affect the local community in three significant ways. Firstly, it will mean post office box holders will most likely have to travel a greater distance to pick up their mail, including seniors who prefer the current convenient location of the boxes. Secondly, people who receive larger mail items and parcels will have to pick these up from another delivery centre. I am advised that this will be at Bundall, which is almost 10 kilometres from the current location. Thirdly, there will be flow-on effects to local businesses in the Robina Village Shopping Centre area. Seven hundred-plus people who collected their mail from the delivery centre will now be going to a different location, a different shopping centre, to clear their postboxes. They will no longer be picking up a newspaper or a coffee at the Robina Village shops. Last week, on 21 February, Gold Coast City Council Division 11 Councillor Jan Grew and I met with local small businesses to discuss their concerns about Australia Post's planned closure of the Robina delivery centre. Businesses in the nearby Robina Village Shopping Centre fear the closure will reduce the number of shoppers at the village, and clearly it will. This is yet another direct hit to small businesses which have already been hit by the economic downturn. In fact one of the small businesses notified me of this closure before Australia Post even informed me of their decision. Tony Keilar, the owner of the nearby newsagency, is very concerned about how this closure will affect his business as well as the other businesses in the Robina Village area. Mr Keilar has owned the Robina Village newsagency for 7½ years. His newsagency currently sells stamps and overnight postal packages which he obtains from Australia Post on a commission basis. He would happily extend the service and would welcome the opportunity to discuss this with Australia Post. Unfortunately, Australia Post is proceeding to implement its closure decision without consultation and without giving affected residents the opportunity to offer alternatives. Mr Keilar believes there should be a full postal service in the village. He voiced concerns to me about the inconvenience of having to go to Bundall for the collection of parcels and mail from a postbox at Robina Town Centre. I am very supportive of Robina Town Centre, which has recently undergone a very major refurbishment. I shop at the town centre regularly-in most weeks, in fact. Parking is terrific when you go to the centre to shop, but it is not easy to park close to the post office if you just need to pop in and pick up your mail. A two-minute stop at the current delivery centre at Robina Village could easily become a 10to 15-minute stop at Robina Town Centre. For a business, 10 minutes to pick up your mail per week has just blown out to the best part of an hour-maybe longer. If it is necessary to drive to Bundall to pick up a parcel, then, depending on traffic, that could be another 40 minutes. All of this just adds to the burden of a small business and is a significant inconvenience to residents. As a potential solution, local newsagent Tony Keilar has suggested that an arrangement could be reached between his newsagency and Australia Post. Mr Keilar is willing to establish a retail post office in conjunction with his newsagency, at his expense. It remains to be seen whether this is an option Australia Post is willing to accept; however, it demonstrates a business which is attempting to come up with an alternative solution to the one currently proposed by Australia Post. The Robina Village newsagency is one of many local businesses which do not want this service to leave the area. Rhonda Fosbeary and Leanne Nunnick, who work at Robina Village shops, were also very vocal in their opposition to the closure. They made it clear that they want proper consultation to take place and a solution to be found. I am disappointed that there has been very little consultation by Australia Post with the post-office box holders and the local community. Unfortunately, this is not the first time that Australia Post has not adequately consulted and has chosen to ignore the community. A number of years ago, Australia Post ignored the community and local businesses and closed the local post office that used to be in the same area, leaving only a mail distribution centre and post-office boxes. Some of the businesses and locals advise me that, when this retail post office closed, there was a decline in business at the stores in the village. It is because they have seen what happens when a postal service is removed that the local community is so concerned about what will happen if the entire postal service is removed from the area. Having seen first hand what happened when the entire postal facility was removed from Palm Beach, I know that the community will be hurt. I believe post offices are the lifeblood of local shopping centres. They attract customers and provide the necessary community service. As I said earlier, I have seen first hand what happens to a community of people and businesses who have their local post-office outlet closed, as was the case in Palm Beach. The Palm Beach post office may have been a retail shop, while this issue relates to a delivery centre and post-office boxes. However, postal services of all kinds provide a necessary community service. Australia Post should be mindful of the needs of the community as they make business decisions for the future. Their actions may well result in a further downturn of their own business as people look for alternatives to postal services, including scanning and emailing letters and using couriers for parcel delivery, which is already competitive and becoming even more so. Australia Post need to start listening to the community that they are supposed to service. I mentioned earlier that Australia Post abruptly closed the Palm Beach post office at the end of 2010. When this occurred, there were other interested parties, including local residents and businesses, who were unable to properly pursue opportunities in the short time frame provided by Australia Post. Now Australia Post has the opportunity to consult with the community and key stakeholders, as is being suggested by Mr Keilar. I hope they do. Along with Councillor Grew, I will seek further discussions with Australia Post with a view to at least keeping the post office boxes at Robina Village. I have already briefly visited many of the businesses in the Robina Village shopping centre. I have encouraged these businesses to contact me and my office with details outlining their concerns about the mail distribution centre closure and post office box relocations. My office contact details have also been given to these businesses to pass on to their customers and local residents, who also share concerns about this issue. I will continue to lobby Australia Post to ensure that local Robina residents and surrounding businesses have appropriate access to a delivery centre and post office boxes. I am very concerned about the impact that the decisions that Australia Post is making-many times in isolation from the community and businesses-have on our local community, and I would like the opportunity to discuss this fully with Australia Post in conjunction with the affected residents and businesses. Pacific Highway Highway in this year's federal and state budgets and of the four-year forward estimates to show the full funding for the completion of the dual carriageway works on it between Hexham and the Queensland border. This has been promised by both federal and state governments of different political persuasions. Both have committed to 2016 being possible as the completion date and therefore, with budgets working on four-year forward estimates, this is the year when the money has to start to show. This is a big challenge, I respect, for both governments. As shown in Senate estimates last week, to complete the Pacific Highway works by 2016, $7 billion is going to be needed from the combined efforts of both the state and federal governments. There is currently a funding dispute going on between the two parties. The state government seems to be requesting an 80-20 split on that $7 billion, whereas the federal government is requesting a fifty-fifty split on that funding over the next four years. Either way, at my end and for most residents on the North Coast, we want the job done. We want the funding to be secured by whatever means possible so that the promises made are not what has been seen too many times previously from both the state and federal governments. Promises turn into broken promises pretty quickly. To put it into context, this is a road that has had 809 deaths on it over the past two decades. It is a dangerous stretch of road. It has between 10,000 and 20,000 traffic movements a day, depending on what part of the highway you are actually monitoring. It is the main truck route between Sydney and Brisbane, and so the conflict between local traffic and interstate road transport is a pretty dangerous mix. To date, since the program began in the early nineties with two horrific bus crashes, around 50 per cent of the highway has been built. In nearly 15 years we have had about 50 per cent of the highway finished. It is therefore a huge challenge, which both the state and federal governments have committed to, to get the remaining 45 to 50 per cent done in just four years.

228,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (21:40,"I rise to talk about the importance of the PacificI note some of the politics of the moment around the funding dispute, which we certainly want to see resolved. I have some quotes from members of this chamber, such as the member for Cowper who, on 26 October 2009, when he was in opposition and not trying to defend a government, said the following: The federal government has let the New South Wales government off the hook in only requiring a contribution of some $500 million up to 2014. This compares to a federal contribution of $3.1 billion. We should be demanding dollar-for-dollar funding from the New South Wales state government and increasing the federal contribution to the road project if it is to be completed within a realistic timeframe. That was the member for Cowper's position only three years ago, which I understand as of today has changed. He seems to be now indicating, because there is a change in the New South Wales government, that he is an advocate for the 80-20 model where the federal government picks up 80 per cent of the tab and New South Wales picks up only 20 per cent. That is in complete contrast to what he said three years ago. Likewise, a very strong public advocate for the Pacific Highway upgrade in a state seat just north of my electorate, Andrew Fraser, on 21 October 2009 said, when he was in opposition: The Pacific Highway is a state road that effectively causes the loss of one life a week. The state government should pour the money in. Again, three years later I would hope that is what Mr Fraser continues to think. However, unfortunately, I think the position has changed and again I think he is now an advocate for the 80-20 split rather than an acknowledgement that it is a state road that at the very least should be funded by the state government on a 50-50 basis. This is important for the North Coast. This is the backbone of life on the North Coast of New South Wales and there is enormous frustration that this is a project that continues to linger on and on and on. It is rubbed in that various politicians of all political persuasions make bold promises. I think we are now through at least two dates that were promised and have now been broken. It would be incredibly disappointing for the North Coast communities if the 2016 deadline was not met. Last week, thankfully, a work schedule was released by the minister for transport for this road. Sadly, that was lost a bit in the machinations of this place over the last week, but it was an important release of a work schedule which did demonstrate that over the next four years in a construction sense the 2016 deadline can be met. The only issue, therefore, is for the Commonwealth and the state to reach a funding agreement and resolve this dispute as to whether it is an 80-20 funding model or a 50-50 funding model. Certainly the federal government will push for 50-50. If you look at the words of members in this place, even from the National Party, they were three years ago arguing for a 50-50 split. But in the end, from my perspective and on behalf of residents up and down the North Coast, I think this is something that is of little interest in regards to how the funding is achieved and more about just getting the job done. There was a horrific truck accident over January, where a young boy went to bed in a house on the side of the highway at Urunga and died as a consequence of an accident with a ute with some drivers who were five times over the limit running into a truck and then the truck going off the road and killing the boy. These stories change communities and change families. There must be the funding in the state and federal budget and there must not be some grand broken promise by the two in an effort to protect budgets at the expense of getting the job done. We are about 52 per cent of the way into a dual carriageway now. By mid 2014, with the current work schedule, we would be about 70 per cent. With all I have I call on the minister for transport to resolve the dispute, to make sure that he can win the fight within the Expenditure Review Committee federally and to reach an agreement with the state National Party roads minister, Duncan Gay, to make sure that funding comes. I call on him to make sure that faith in politicians, in political parties and in public policy is restored on the North Coast and that we get this job done as committed to by all as they went into the election.

Irregular Maritime Arrivals (Question No. 698) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 31 October 2011: How many Irregular Maritime Arrivals (IMAs) indicated that they resided in a country different to their country of birth/origin for more than six weeks prior to arriving in Australia, and for each of these IMAs, (a) what was his/her country of birth/origin, and (b) in which country had he/she resided prior to arriving in Australia, and for what length of time. Mr Bowen: The answer to the honourable member's question is: Departmental systems do not record this level of detail and the preparation of this answer would involve interrogation of information provided by each client. This would be a significant diversion of departmental resources and it is not considered that the additional work can be justified. Clean Energy Future Plan (Question No. 710) Mr Ramsey asked the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, in writing, 3 November 2011: (1) Is it a fact that under the Climate Change Plan, refrigerant gas which currently attracts a levy of $165 per tonne to reduce chlorofluorocarbon emissions, is to be replaced by a levy of $30065 per tonne to reduce carbon dioxide emissions; if so, has Treasury conducted modelling on the likely impact of this levy on the retail industry and households; if so, will he provide information on this. (2) What alternative refrigeration exists for the retail industry that would not attract these levies, and how does it compare with traditional refrigeration in terms of energy efficiency. Mr Combet: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Under the Australian Government's Clean Energy Future Plan, an equivalent carbon price will apply to synthetic greenhouse gases from 1 July 2012. This will be implemented through the Ozone and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989. The existing cost recovery levy of $165 per tonne on refrigerant gas will continue to apply to all importers of these gases (in bulk or contained in products and equipment) and is not being replaced by a flat levy of $30,065 per tonne, as suggested in the question. However, the total levy payable will be proportional to the global warming potential (GWP) of the relevant refrigerant gas. An analysis conducted by the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency shows that the impact of the new arrangement on consumers is expected to be low as the amount of these gases in consumer products is generally small, making the refrigerant gas content only a small part of the overall cost of the product. For example, the price of a domestic refrigerator would increase by around $4 and the price of a new car would increase by around $18 due to the refrigerant gas contained in the air conditioner (if the full amount of the equivalent carbon price is passed on to consumers). The Government's household assistance package takes these impacts into account and ensures that two in three households will get tax cuts or increased payments that cover their expected average price impact of both this measure and the other elements of the carbon price. (2) It is important to note that there is a range of equipment in Australia using a variety of refrigerants other than synthetic gases such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are banned under the Montreal Protocol, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). The alternative refrigerants include carbon dioxide, ammonia and hydrocarbons which are known as natural refrigerants. Available also is HFO-1234yf, which is a new synthetic refrigerant with a low GWP of 4, highly comparable to the hydrocarbons. Uptake of lower GWP refrigerant gases is what the new policy is designed to achieve. According to the United Nations Environmental Program, equipment using low-GWP alternatives can achieve equal or superior energy efficiency in a number of sectors, such as domestic refrigeration, commercial refrigeration and some types of air conditioning systems. In the case of industrial refrigeration, for example, hydrocarbon and ammonia systems are typically 10 to 30 per cent more energy efficient than conventional high-GWP HFC systems.
