The shortage exists in spite of high production in the main exporting countries. The United States '.>f America had a record wheat production from tlie current, harvest, and for the third successive year made a new record for wheat production. Australia is now harvesting a record crop, which apparently will be about. 20,000,000 bushels higher than any previous crop, and Canada has produced a moderate crop. Argentina's figures are not known yet, but its crop should 'be about the average. The scarcity is caused by small crops in Europe, which has not yet returned to its normal pre-war production, while reduced rice production in Asia, has increased the demand for wheat as an alternative food. The shortage can hardly bo given in precise figures. In many ways it is a shortage not of wheat but of other cereals and food. shortage is about 1.0,000,000 tons of wheat and this has resulted in exceptionally high prices for wheat, exported. Those price.;: reflect the urgent need and misery of sonic countries. While they bring prosperity to the exporting countries, grave doubts arise as to the future. It has been realized for a long time past that abnormal prices-whethe r high or low-ar e not healthy, and that the soundness of our wheat, industry depends on the maintenance of prices which are fair both to the producer and the consumer. For several years, Australia has been associated with the International Emergency Food Council. During World War II . , it was found necessary for a combined Food Board to supervise the distribution of food exports to allied countries. In the post-war period the International Emergency Food Council succeeded to this task. It. recommends allocation* which ensure to needy countries a reasonable share of the supplies available. The council has a membership of more than 30 countries, including both food exporting nations and food importers. The Union of .Soviet Socialist. Republics and Argentina, have not become members. Wheat, as the chief food grain, is an important commodity in International Emergency Food Council allocations. This attempt at international co-operation in distributing wheat supplies equitably has been most successful, and during years of scarcity, has given results which, could not have been achieved in any other way. Supplies have been based on the need to achieve something like world rationing of wheat. Adherence hy Australia to allocations has meant that, our wheat supplies have gone to nearby countries. Before World WarI . I . , the ITnited Kingdom was our chief market, bnt exports of wheat to that country since the beginning of the war have practically ceased. To Europe, which was also an important market for us, our exports have been almost negligible. The same thing litis applied to other exporting countries. This deliberate disregard of many of the ordinary marketing considerations has, for some years past, almost eliminated the normal international competition of the world's wheat market.. But it has saved shipping and time, and However, the estimated has given the best distribution practicable. During the season which we are now entering, Australia will continue the co-operation with other countries which has been beneficial and necessary. One other feature which I should mention in regard to tbe world's wheat, i= the proposed International Wheat Agreement. The exporting and importing countries have been in agreement on the need for measures which would provide adequate supplies of wheat all the time at prices f a i r to grower and consumer alike. The general principles are clear, and",16,Wheat Government Policy

46,Mr Pollard (Ballarat,"Minister forthere is no difference of opinion regarding them. The details, however, have heen the subject of protracted discussion over several years, and it has not been possible to secure agreement on them. Further meetings have been arranged. [ now turn to the Australian position. Our crop is a record, and looks like being 235,000,000 bushels, or thereabouts. No one knows how big a crop will be until it is "" in the bag just started. There is the uncertainty, usual at this stage, as to the size of the crop, and the weather during the last few weeks has affected it in ways which cannot be correctly appraised at, the moment. The crop seems certain to be u record, but no one can say by how much it will surpass the previous record of 215,000,000 bushels. The big crop brings its own problems. Storage is presenting difficulties which will be overcome by co-operation of growers and the Government authorities concerned. Haulage w i ll provide a transport problem for all State railways, and, obviously, it will take a number of months to get the wheat to ports for sale. Meanwhile, the Australian Government is guaranteeing an overdraft which will probably exceed £60,000,000 to cover the first advance and expenses. This ensures a reasonable first payment to growers before any of the wheat can be sold and shipped, or even carried to the ports. If the figure of 235,000,000 bushels is reached, there will be about 155,000,000 bushels for export. Shipping this quantity is likely to occupy the whole of the season, and perhaps longer. Meanwhile, there is not likely to lw any difficulty in selling all the wheat, and flour that we can make available as fast as we can supply them. The problem is rather to allocate the supplies to the best advantage among many claimants, and in this, of course, the International Emergency Food Council allocations are important. place for the sale of large quantities of wheat to the United Kingdom. I have mentioned that Australia has been out of the United Kingdom market for some years, but despite this, the British Ministry of Food has been our biggest customer, and has bought supplies for British areas, tn the coming season, we hope to supply a large quantity of wheat for the United Kingdom market, as well as for the nearer areas for which B rita in buys. Negotiations are taking place also with India, and a delegation from that country is at present in Australia to complete the arrangements. This sale is regarded a9 being especially important in view of the particular advantages accruing mutually to India and Australia from our trade with that country. India has jute, linseed, and harvesting has only and cotton goods which Australia needs, and we have food products which are important for that country. Other sales are also being negotiated by the Australian Wheat Board with the larger number of countries needing wheat. We cannot supply all demands, but an effort is being made to obtain the most equitable distribution of our supplies. Steps are also being taken to ensure that the greatest practicable amount of wheat shall he available for export. Therefore, tbe allocation for stock feed wheat during the coming season will be retained. Its use will be confined to essential users, and quotas for users in tbe various States will continue. In other words, despite the large crop, it is not intended to allow the unrestricted use of feed wheat in Australia, and the quantity saved in this way will be exported. This is the last season in which Australian wheat will be marketed under the war-time set-up. The Commonwealth is carrying on for another year, although I had hoped that before this, an agreement would have been reached on permanent marketing arrangements. For this season, no alternative method of marketing is available which would be satisfactory to growers, so the Australian Wheat Board will again do the job under the extended powers covered hy the Defence (Transitional Provisions) B ill whicli w ill be passed during this sessional period. Plansf or the future Negotiations are taking must be completed by the middle of 1!)4S. and another conference will be held shortly to ascertain whether an agreement can be reached for a plan involving the Commonwealth and States in joint legislation. Tho war-time marketing has been satisfactory, and has given better results than any one could reasonably have expected when it was first formulated. Growers have been brought in to an unprecedented extent, to manage the marketing of their products, and I believe that all sections want the continuation of an Australian pooling system. The Oommonwealth will do its part to bring this about, and I hope that the difficulties regarding details, which have prevented the adoption of a plan of organized marketing, will be overcome. The satisfactory results of war-time marketing can be judged by the general desire of growers to maintain the system. This has been shown by growers' support for the organized marketing of potatoes, barley, and, in Tasmania, field peas, as well as wheat. The Australian Government considered that a stabilization plan is necessary for the wheat industry. The forthcoming conference will try to reach agreement on details of a plan in which the States will co-operate, and if agreement is not reached, the States will then have to consider action to be taken in regard to marketing within their, boundaries. The Commonwealth cannot continue the present system after the 1947-48 season, because it lacks the necessary powers. Assent reported. Bill returned from the Senate without vides, in the first and second stages, for amendment. Works and Housing) [11.21] I move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1936, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work, which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, and on which the committee has duly reported to the House the result of its investigations, namely:"" The erection of a building in Perth for repatriation administrative offices "". The proposal was referred by this House to the Public Works Committee on the 2lst May, 1947, vide Hansard, page 2669. That proposal provided for a building containing a ground floor and six upper floors to be constructed of reinforced conthe Government's powers to make regulation* crete with brick facing. The estimated cost, as submitted, was £222,750. As a result of its investigations the committee came to the conclusion that, owing to the value of the site selected at the corner of William-street and Bazaar-terrace, Perth, and the urgent need to alleviate the unhealthy and overcrowded state of government accommodation in Perth, the plan originally referred to it was inadequate. An alternative plan was prepared and presented to the committee providing for a building of entirely different design. The building now recommended by the committee will be erected in three stages. The first and second stages will be planned and constructed in the one contract, and the third stage will be left for future addition when conditions are more favorable. This scheme provides not only for the Repatriation Department but also for other Commonwealth departments in Perth. It is proposed that the building shall consist of a ground floor and seven upper floors and that, in order to conserve bricks and to provide a structure in keeping with the prominent position which it will occupy in the city, it shall be faced with local stone. Compared with the original proposal, which provided for 45,000 square feet of floor space at an estimated an effective floor area of approximately 61,000 square feet at an estimated cost of £250,000, plus the cost of stone facing, which will be approximately £15,000.

F. Walsh. This private company operates under great difficulty with all tbe obstructions put in its path by the Minister and his colleagues. When it wanted to buy aircraft it was refused permission. It had to go to the High Court to get a writ of mandamus. Then it was prevented from buying the aircraft by the Treasury. The Government then approached the owners of the aircraft, the United States Army Air Porce, and said that it would buy them. The Americans showed proper disgust and flew the aircraft out of the country to the Philippines. When I asked the Minister why the Government was spending 1,000,000 dollars on American aircraft, he said that Australian airline companies could buy aircraft where they liked. The answer was misleading, but we are used to the Minister's evasion and general obstruction. We asked why a private airline company was to be prevented from landing Skymasters at the Cam bridge aerodrome, Hobart, for the Christmas rush. We have been promised an answer, but have not yet received it. Probably the Minister thinks ,lfr. White.

Was a proper investigation made of tlie British Viking and other British aircraft .before orders were placed by the Australian National Airlines Commission for American Convairsf 2. What would be the dollar saving if British instead of American aircraft had been bought; 3. Had a certificate of airworthiness been issued for Convair aircraft at the time the chairman of the commission placed orders for these aircraft? 4. On what airlines were these aircraft operating at the time orders were placed? 3. Were British Viking aircraft in actual operation on British European Airways in 1046: on Indian National Airwaysi n 1947, and on the Royal Tour of South Africa? 0. What induced the Minister to overlook the factors favouring the purchase -of British aircraft? The Minister went right back on what he had told me previously. Originally, he said that British aircraft were not available, but in answer to my question on the notice-paper, he admitted that they were available. We saw I will make the one the Viking aircraft here. Sir Keith Smith, the representative of the manufacturers, took many members of this Parliament on a flight in it over Canberra. Honourable members know its suitability for use on feeder routes. In answer to the second part of my question the Minister saidThe overriding considerations were efficiency and economy in the type of operation being undertaken hy the commission in Australia.

86,Mr Fadden,"ill on starts to form a branch of the department around himself, and it. is for Iii* reason that we are faced with such a fantastic increa -e of salaries The Department of Civil Aviation, as a matter of fact, was doing a better job a few years ago than it is doing now. The balance-sheet covering the period of the inauguration of Trans-Australia Airlines is extraordinary, and. indeed, most alarming. A most lavish expenditure for labour and materials required for the Trans-Australia Airlines establishments was embarked housing priorities in regard to building materials and labour were completely ignored. woiilth authorities retained control in this field, all permissions sought' for by Trans-Australia Airlines were given, and all necessary labour and materials were found, notwithstanding that there was such a heavy demand for housing needs throughout the whole countryside. When, the State authorities assumed control, the issuing of permits was ignored. Trans-Australia Airlines, an almost, complete embargo has existed in regard to the carrying out of reconstruction and renewal work urgently required in connection with the premises occupied by private airline companies. action of Trans-Australia Airlines was to try to attract stuff from the private airline companies by the offer of fantastic salaries. Even down to the most junior clerk, salaries have been offered by Trans-Australia Airlines which are greatly in excess of those which priva!-airlines could afford. The first action of the Government airline on entering the field of civil aviation was to reduce fares and freight rates. Trans-Australia Airlines has suffered -diow how completely uneconomic were ihe rates fixed by this Government concern : but in an endeavour to secure business it was prepared to quote most ridiculous rates. In these circumstances it is not surprising that, a loss of £500,000 should have been incurred. I have scon letters from firms in Sydney to their customers in Brisbane to the effect that the customers could obtain a rebate on goods consigned by air through Trans-Australia Airlines, although I do not know the extent to which these practices have been carried out. This was, of course, a petty procedure and also an expensive method of competing with private airline companies. The Commonwealth has supplied aircraft lavishly to 'Trans-Australia Airlines and has even provided an amount, of approximately $1,000,000 for the purchase of Gonvi'.ir aircraft', although applications by private airline companies for new aircraft are rigidly policed and, in the case of Australian National Airways Proupon, and prietary Limited, uniformly rejected. 'The only occasion since the inauguration of Trans-Australia Airlines, when AusSo long as the Oomniontralian National Airways Proprietary Limited was permitted to acquire 0.47 ma chines, was subsequent; to its instituting the Pacific service. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited refused to divert its TlC.4 machines to this service unless the Commonwealth allowed it to purchase C.47 aircraft to replace the Skymasters on the internal airlines that would be diverted. This Since the inauguration of transaction was eventually allowed as a condition of the Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited providing the Pacific service. As we all know, all mails have been diverted to Trans-Australia Airlines and that is a branch of business The first of great magnitude financially. Prior to the inauguration of Trans-Australia Airlines the rule applied was that mails were to be lifted by the first available aircraft. That was a valuable rule from the point of view of botli the Postal Department and the users of the airmail service. But that provision, which was beneficial to the people, has now been abandoned and all mails are carried by Trans-Australia Airlines aircraft even The losses which though machines of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited may leave earlier. Trans-Australia Airlines is being used as a grossly unfair cut-throat competitor of the private airline companies, with the object; of putting thorn out of business, regardless of the final cost to the taxpayer. As I have said, that loss already amounts to £505,927, which is one-quarter of the capital of TransAnstralia Airlivies. Private airlines had done yeomen pioneering work prior to the establishment of Trans-Australia Airlines. They supplied extra services where they were which, themselves, need not have been needed merely by increasing the number established.

The item, ""Buildings and Improvements. Leasehold Property, &c."" is shown as an asset valued at £137,000. Some time ago. we pressed the Minister to say what was the value of buildings which had been transferred to Trans-Australia Airline-. I very much question whether the amount shown in the balance-sheet, represents a fair valuation of the buildings which have been transferred to Trans-Australia Airlines, or constructed for it. Does the Minister suggest, that the hangar constructed at Essendon, together with the Manchester Unity Building, Melbourne, and the other real assets of Trans-Australia Airlines, have a value of only £137,000? We know that the Government had paid out so much money for the Manchester Unity Building that it stated some time ago that it was not prepared to go on paying rent, but was determined to acquire the building. building stand-in the Government's, or may become like tbe traditional barmaid. in that of Trans-Australia.

When I see a substantial practical purposes, the building reprepayment for this limited number of persents a real asset, enjoyed by Transsonnel, averaging more than £100 per Australia Airlines. Another item to which .1. call attention is superannuation for members of the flying staff. That is shown in the .balance sheet as a liability of £24,000, wbich, presumably, relates to the period of nine months covered by the commission's operations. Therefore, for a full year, the amount would be about £32,000. The report shows that the flying staff consists of 149 pilots and 7C hostesses, a total of 225. Thus, it would appear that the Government is creating a superannuation fund which will cost over £30,000 a year for the benefit of 225 persons. I do not. claim, to be a. mathematician, but 1 believe that if that amount of money were invested by a private citizen for his personal assurance, it would return him, in due course, some thousands of pounds. Air hostesses and pilots are young persons, and I believe in view of the considerable sum set out by way of superannuation, that the Government should tell the Parliament the nature of the provision that is being made. 1 make it dear that I have no objection to ;i. government instrumentality making a fair superannuation payment to its employees. We do it in respect of our Public Service generally, and we should do it in respect of persons engaged in flying duties. Perhaps they have a shorter working life than most person? in government employment. Perhaps, they must retire earlier because they are not permitted to fly when they attain a certain age.

We can give to the Minister this comforting assurance that, if any criticism which we raise can improve either the service or the economical management of the organization, we shall be very pleased to offer it. House is considering simultaneously the Air Navigation Bill (No. 2) and the Australian National Airlines Bill. The Air Navigation Bill (No. 2) deals with developments since the original air convention was signed, prescribing standards and conditions of air navigation, and a more up-to-date system of control of this vital and developing service. Honourable members, have little, if any, cause for complaint against the operations of the original act, and this bill should receive their unanimous support. The second bill amends the Australian National Airlines Act 1945. I heartily agree with its provisions, and with the view of the Government that Australian airlines should be nationalized. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), in his concluding words, made a more realistic statement about Australian nationally operated airlines than has characterized his recent speeches. The Australian community, he rightly said, are shareholders in this great and valuable national undertaking, and the honourable member, on this occasion, departed from tlie practice, which I have regretted, of criticizing governmental activities as socialist ventures designed to enslave the people. The trend throughout the world is to ensure that airlines shall be nationally owned, or if that is not done, as in some countries like the United States of America, that selected operators shall take over particular routes. This trend will continue, because the cost of operating air services will preclude competition on certain routes. In addition, the overhead expenditure which is involved in competing airlines tends, unless strict, control is exercised, to reduce the profits of competing organizations and lead to the introduction of unsafe practices in air navigation. That tendency is bad for the development of this comparatively new arid most valuable means of transport, and a great danger to the travelling public who use air services. For those two reasons, namely, the future of air travel and the safety of people who use air services, airlines must, be nationally owned by the public, or selected operators must control certain routes under strict governmental supervision. It is idle to claim that this is a socialist venture introduced by a government which has no regard for the welfare of the people. On a previous occasion, I pointed out that the Government of Canadaa Liberal Government-provided, just as the Australian Government has done, for a nationally owned and operated system of air navigation. The Government of the United Kingdom has also provided for publicly owned airlines. As I stated earlier, tlie trend in the United States of America is to have selected operators on prescribed routes, thus preventing competition which would be ruinous to their business and a great deterrent to the organized and proper development of American airlines. In the early stages of the development of American airlines, crashes became so frequent that President Hoover was obliged to appoint a virtual dictator of air travel and air navigation. This official was later a distinguished general in air operations in World War II . In the position to which President Hoover appointed him, he had far-reaching powers to ensure that air travel was conducted with due regard for safety, and that the force of competition, which then",29,Honourable Members Yes

100,Mr Burke (Perth) [12.17],"Th eexisted, did not ruin operators and, before ruining them, compel them to resort to unsafe practices to make profits or safeguard their capital. Had that action not been taken, the whole future of civilaviation in the United States of America might have been jeopardized. That policy has been extended in a-n -endeavour to provide selected operators for .the main air routes. Even better than that system is a nationally owned system. A service in which real competition cannot exist should be owned as a public instrumentality. As such, its operations will be open to public scrutiny at regular intervals. It should have a single purpose, namely, that of providing a real service to the people without a duplication of overhead costs, and conducting its affairs at the lowest possible charge to the general public. It is not always the best tiling when, as in the recent controversy, one operator has sought to reduce fares payable by the public. In general practice, it is desirknow. able; but if a reduction of charges tends to lower the standard of the service and finally pushes a competitor out of the business, the ultimate result may be an increase of charges to the public. The practice is generally adopted in an endeachased by the organization, a correspondvour to gain the bulk of the business offering. When that has been achieved, the invariable result, as history shows, has been not a continual lowering of charges, but actually an increase of charges to cover essential costs. So it may well be in this case. The Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Drakeford) has ably explained the position in the recent controversy, and the blame does not lie on him in the way in which it has been attributed to him. The balance-sheet of Trans-Australia Airlines has been trenchantly criticized because of the loss that it discloses. Bethan £500,000. We have to realize, when fore I deal with that aspect, I shall refer looking at the figures, that Trans-Austo two matters which the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Eadden), and the honourable member for Fawkner raised. Like many other honourable members, I believe that competition should not exist among operators of air services. sarily incurred in setting up an organizaThis competition leads to duplication of ground staff, and a variety of facilities, including telephones as the Leader of the shown as capital charges for setting up Australian Country party stated. As the the organization ? Mr Biirke. result of this competition and duplication, overhead charges are vastly increased. In my opinion, that indicates that this is a type of service which can give maximum efficiency only when operated by a monopoly over specified routes. The honourable member for Fawkner endeavoured to show that the figures in the balance sheet of Trans-Australia Airlines must be incorrect, because the cost of the Manchester Unity Building in Melbourne -the head-quarters of the Trans-Australia Airlines-doe s not appear to be reflected in the total figure in the balance sheet provided for buildings. I presume that the Manchester Unity Building was purchased by the Government, that Trans-Australia Airlines pays rent to the Government, or that a contra-charge is entered against Trans-Australia Airlines on a rental basis. Australia Airlines pay? if an asset were entered in the books of Trans-Australia Airlines representing the building which is said to have been puring charge must be made against the commission. So, it is clear from the balance-sheet that the building has not been purchased by the Australian National Airlines Commission, but is rented from the Government, which purchased it. That is sound procedure. If buildings have to be purchased for use by government instrumentalities, they should be purchased by the Government and not by the various instrumentalities which have need of the accommodation in the buildings. Secondly, the balance-sheet discloses a loss of more tralia Airlines is a new venture, and, as the report of the Australian National Airlines Commission itself states, a big percentage of the charges shown are not operational charges, but charges necestion of this kind.",30,Honourable Members Yes

105,Mr Ryan,"Then why are they nottralian National Airlines Commission shows that they are capital charges. They are not operating charges, which is the normal result shown by a balance-sheet and accounts of a trading corporation. The capital charges, as the Leader of the Australian Country party well knows, not only for actual physical assets, but for all types of expenditure which will only once he incurred, and the preliminary administrative charges incurred in the setting up of a basic organization, are normally regarded in a private undertaking as temporary assets. The amount would be entered as a charge against operating costs-agains t the current transactions of the corporation-bu t would be written off gradually over a period of years. That does not appear to have been done in the accounts of the Australian National Airlines Commission, although the result would be the same in the end. Under normal private business practice, the amount would be written off over a period of years, with the result that in later years operations of the company would show a lower profit, whereas the current deficit would be reduced fairly substantially. speaking about profits. charges which have been discussed are necessary to the establishment of such an organization. As I have said, they will be incurred only once in its lifetime. They are exceptional administrative charges which normally would be capitalized by a private undertaking and written off over a period of years. Under one system, such charges are written off immediately against operating costs. Under the other system, annual profits are reduced by an amount sufficient to write off the initial costs over a period of years. Having in mind the tremendous expenditure that is necessary to establish an organization such as Trans-Australia Airlines, the amount of loss incurred to date has not been very great. Very high charges are involved in creating the initial organization. penses are too great. to prove. The honourable member has certainly given no indication that that is the case. provided by Trans-Australia Airlines could have been provided merely by placing a few more aircraft in operation with the private companies. airlines not only increases their overhead costs but also increases the bazar' of air travel, and, therefore, the trend throughout the world has been to ensure that only one airline shall operate >""i certain routes. It is not correct to say that the desired result could have been achieved by adding a few more aircraft to existing private airline services. It is true that, at certain periods, one airline could cope with the volume of traffic between the eastern States and Western Australia, for instance. The Government sought to achieve the effect of uncompetitive operation by creating a single nationally owned system of airlines. That will eventually be done. It has been done in Great Britain, in Canada, and, I believe, in New Zealand. The system certainly will be adopted in every country within a reasonably short space of time. As the honourable member for Balaclava has said, air transport services could have been increased by placing more aircraft in commission. That could have been done, at a much lower cost than has been incurred, simply by allowing Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited to absorb other companies, a process that was taking place in any case. No good can 'be done by talking about pioneers in aviation and their rights. The fact is that the costs of airline operation are so high that the pioneers could not remain in business without securing substantial capital backing. They were being pushed out, either rapidly or gradually, by more powerful companies. Lower operating costs could have been achieved by allowing Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited to take over all airlines in Australia. In fact, that company was already gradually acquiring control of the major airlines. the overhead exThis merely bears out the point of my argument, namely, that competition between airline services causes higher costs and additional overhead expenses,",31,Honourable Members Yes

The Australian National Airlines Commission has established a very high standard of service throughout Australia, and its activities have amply justified the action of the Government in creating it. I believe that, even if that organization had not been established, there would still have been a demand for increased air transport charges because of rising costs. This would have happened whether Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited had been the sole airline operator or whether there had been, competition between a number of companies. Trans-Australia Airlines has been wrongly accused of reducing the charges in a price war. The simple fact is that formerly Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited gave the benefit of reduced charges only in special circumstances to selected individuals or groups of people. Trans-Australia. Airlines, therefore, decided that the special lower charges made by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited in such circumstances should be available to all passengers over the full range of its own services. do what Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was doing. ways services, like Trans-Australia Airlines, and unlike Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, arc common carriers and cannot vary their charges for the benefit of particular persons or groups of persons. They can vary, their charges only by providing season tickets at reduced fares which must, of Convair aircraft, I made a statement, be available to everybody who wishes to take advantage of them. Under common law. they cannot do otherwise. ties in Victoria enter into special personal contracts. duced charges must be freely available to every member of the community. contracts. under the law. They may make special concessions available by means of issuing season tickets for travel within defined areas, but such concessions cannot be made available to some persons but not to others. Trans-Australia Airlines did not engage in a price war. It has made special rates available, but they are available all members of the community. I conclude by saying that Trans-Australia Airlines has provided a splendid service. Its operating costs, plus its capital charges, have not been excessive, having regard to the heavy essential initial cost« of creating such a large organization. The increased charges which have been authorized would have been introduced whether Trans-Australia Airlines bad been operating or not. Generally, overt-he whole field of air transport, Trans-Australia Airlines has made a valuable contribution to the development of Australian aviation, and I believe that its results will improve as the years pass. -In this debate there has been no criticism of the services supplied' by Trans-Australia. Airlines and by other airlines. The main trend of argument has been that the operations of Trans-Australia Airlines are unnecessary in Australia at this stage of our history, that the overhead costs are excessively high, and that the volume of materials and man-power diverted by this organization from our post-war reconstruction effort is too grea:. That also is what I had in mind '.before the debate commenced. There are good reasons in support of those arguments. A. few months ago, when the Government placed an order in the United States of America for the supply of a number which was published in the Melbourne press, that the Government should not have made those purchases bnt should have conserved dollars for the purchase of agricultural tractors. Very little attemptwas made to reply to my statement, but one Minister pointed out that, even f dollars were plentiful, tractors could not be purchased from the United States of America.

It is easy to understand, that conditions could be made so difficult that private airlines would not be able to use the aerodromes at all. This House, some months ago, passed the Federal Aid Roads and WorksB ill . It was then pointed out honourable member start talking about perambulators? now. see far ahead, but if he will listen he will understand. Revenue obtained by the Government from airline operators by means of the petrol tax has been set aside for the construction of aerodromes and other facilities tliat are mentioned in the bill now before the House. That tax is collected from all companies operating aircraft in Australia and, of course, large sums have been contributed by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited, and other aviation firms. These sums have been used for the construction of aerodromes. Now, the Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Drakeford) seeks power which would enable him, if he wished, to prevent those companies from using the aerodromes. Why should not the taxpayers, who supplied the money, be allowed free access to the aerodromes? The creation of the powers sought by the Minister in this bill is likely to cause a great injustice, and the Minister should give an explanation of his proposals. It seems that Trans-Australia Airlines, having sustained a financial loss of over £500,000 1 in its first nine months of operaT h e purchase of tion, has decided that this loss must not be allowed to continue and that it must be allowed to make a .profit.

The Government proposes to impose restriction.""-, on private airlin t companies so they will not be able to use aerodromes, thus leaving Trans-Australia Airlines free of competition. Having cleared the field of opposition, Trans-A ustralia A i r lines will be able to fix whatever charges for air travel it wishes.

128,Mr Turnbull,"The Minister willlogic of the statement of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Burke), that if a company reduced fares now we should probably have to pay higher fares later. I .always understood that competition was the lifeblood of trade, and that genuine competition meant reasonable charges. If Trans-Australia Airlines rids itself of competition, it will be able to dictate what the public shall pay for air travel. In order to convert the loss of more than £500,000 last year into a trading profit in other years, the commission will have to do something. I believe that this bill represents a part of its plan to recover its position financially, although, from the viewpoint of the nation, not economically. The honourable member for Perth also said that one airline operating on certain routes would overcome the hazards of air travel. Australia has a record equal to, if not superior it has under the Banking Act to crush to, that of any other country in the safety of civil flying. There is not the slightest justification for saying that Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited will increase the hazards of flying if it reduces its fares, because it will curtail expenditure on safety measures. That company's safety record is equal to that of any other airline company in the world. I said that the money expended on the purchase of aircraft in the United States of America would have been better expended on the purchase of tractors, the Minister said, ""What about perambulators?"" I do not propose to say anything about perambulators in this debate, because I realize that, when the Government has a monopoly in air travel, there will be no perambulators and that the taxpayers will have to ""carry the baby"". -The interest aroused in this measure ought to convince the Government that its passage should be delayed until honourable members have a full opportunity of considering all its aspects. To introduce and pass it in the dying hours of the sessional period is reprehensible. In common with other honourable members, I have watched with great interest the development of Trans-Australia Airlines. The Government has made it clear from the inception of its interest in airways that it ultimately proposes to monopolize them. Its first step in that direction was to ask the people at a referendum for power over civil aviation. The people refused that power. Then it tried, by means of legislation, to establish a monopoly in air travel. It was defeated in the High Court. Now it has decided to put a stranglehold on private companies that pioneered airways in Australia. The Banking Act is its first step towards that end. I have no doubt that if and when the government bank has a monopoly in banking the private airlines will be refused financial accommodation. If honourable members opposite say that that contemplation is ridiculous, I can prove that the Government is already restricting the development of private airline companies by various subterfuges under its existing powers. That ought to convince people that it will not hesitate to use the powers opposition. ing Act is before the High Court. to say anything further about that. I merely illustrated my point. The huge loss of more than £550,000 made by the government airline in its first year of Earlier, when operation does not surprise me in the least. It surprises no one who has acquaintance with governmental control of industries and essential services. The taxpayer has to pay for every costly socialistic experiment of the Government, which is playing with the people's money. The Government is prepared not only to waste the people's money on its airline ventures, but also to foster the development of that venture by restricting the development of its competitors. Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited at almost the same time applied to the Department of Civil Aviation for permission to operate an air service between Melbourne and Wynyard. Ordinarily, two competing companies applying to operate similar services would both be granted licences, but when it is a matter of competition between a governmental instrumentality and private enterprise, the private company is shut out. on the excuse that the Government had decided to limit the consumption of aviation spirit. The Government could not",34,Honourable Members Yes

132,Mr Harrison,"I do not proposesay openly, "" We do not propose to let you compete with us"". That would not suit its 'book, because it is trying to lull was such an excuse. The Government is private airline operators into a false sense of security. Moreover, if the Government did that, it would lay itself open to a challenge at law. So it relied on a pretext. The excuse cannot be justified, however, because, at the very time it was offered, Trans-Australia Airlines advertised three extra services between Sydney and Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane and Sydney and Adelaide, which would use considerably more petrol weekly than would be used by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited in conducting a service between Melbourne and Wynyard. So we have one law for the Government and another for private enterprise. When the Department of Civil Aviation was tackled about the matter, the reply was, "" We had granted Trans-Australia Airlines permission to operate the service between Melbourne and Wynyard before we received instructions about the conservation of petrol"". permission had been given to Trans-Australia Airlines at the beginning of September, before the Government had decided to conserve aviation fuel. excuse, because who is in a better position to know the Government's plans to restrict the use of aviation fuel than is a government department? It is easy for a department that knows what the Government plans to do about saving fuel to grant permission to a governmental instrumentality to operate a service before the restrictions are imposed We are all aware of what happens. A few iays before the Government decided to issue no further licences for the importation of certain articles a licence to imaviation in Australia, built up extensive port them was granted to a member of this House. We know that governments have used information in their possession to grant privileges to favoured persons. That is what happened in this instance. It said, ""We gave permission to Trans-Australia Airlines to operate an extended service from tbe beginning of September""; but after the beginning of September restrictions were imposed in order to conserve petrol. When I draw attention to the fact that at that same time Trans-Australia Airlines was advertising an increase of its inter-capital services honourable members will see how hollow not only restricting the private airline companies by every possible means, but it is also using the petrol position to break down their competition with the Government instrumentality. Here is the complete pattern of monopolistic socialist control. The Government's proposals regarding the airlines were rejected by the people at a referendum; its legislation was declared ultra vires the ' Constitution by the High Court; and now it is imposing restrictions upon them allegedly because of the petrol position. Trans-Australia Airlines will not be embarrassed by the petrol position. Notwithstanding the restrictions on the use of petrol it was able to extend its inter-capital services from the 3rd November. Here honourable members can see the complete pattern of the policy of this socialist monopolist Government in regard to airlines. The The department said that Government is acting like a vampire, lulling its victims into a false sense of security, and at the same time planning to sit astride them and drain from them their very life-blood. From That was a convenient time to time honourable members have illustrated the way in which the big monopolies operate in this country. The case of the gold-mining industry has been frequently cited. They often tell of the old desert rat who makes his "" strike"", but reaps no reward for his pioneering efforts because the big monopoly companies take over his find and ultimately squeeze him out. Here we have a classic example of government monopolistic control. The airways companies which have pioneered organizations, and provided valuable services for the people, paid petrol tax on the petrol they used. It is claimed that by expending a proportion of the tax on the construction of aerodromes the tax collected in that way has been repaid. The airline companies have never been paid back in full. Considerably more than the amount expended by the Government on aerodrome construction has been provided in tax by tlie airline companies. If the airline operators dare to cut tlieir prices lower than the Government desires it now proposes to impose prohibitive charges whicb. will prevent them from using government-controlled aerodromes. Is there anything virtuous in such a policy? Is it not designed solely to establish monopolistic control over all air services, to strangle, bash or belt out of existence, one way or another, any private airline company tliat dares to oppose the Government? This bill is too important to the people stand how the Director-General can of this countiy to be brought before us in the dying hours of the sessional period. It, pin-points the Government's policy to secure, complete monopolistic control of the air. With but a few hours of the sessional period left a bill with far-reachhave been told that the positions required ing implications should never have been placed before us. The Government has long since ceased to approach anything in the interests of the people. How can we consider adequately such an important, bill as this within the short time allotted to us? This Government is recreant to its trust to the people. I ask the Minister either to withdraw the bill or to extend the sittings of the Parliament so that we may be given an opportunity to debate it clause by clause. Only by that means may we gain a complete understanding of the Government's policy in respect of civil aviation. I appeal to the Minister to withdraw the bill or to give us adequate opportunity to ascertain whether it be possible to build something substantial from it. .During this debate we have heard a lot about air personnel, accountants, tractors, and even timber. mention has been made of the control staff. I do not intend to deal with the whole of the staff, but with one particular section, namely, those concerned with airways, supervision and aeradio. Among these sections of the staff there is growing discontent at the manner in which persons appointed to temporary positions are being promoted to very high posts on a permanent basis. It appears that the .Director-General of Civil Aviation is able to appoint men to the service under section 47 of fhe Commonwealth Public Service Act which, in effect, states that if the Governor General deems it expedient a person may be appointed temporarily to a position and. within a period of six months, if no other person with tlie necessary qualifications is available for appointment, that person may be appointed permanently. In some instances permanent appointments of outsiders have been made without calling for applications from persons already in the service. I find it, difficult to undercertify that no person with the necessary qualifications is available if a. position be not advertised. When the airway supervisors and aeradio employees have appealed against such appointments, they the services of officers with aviation experience. To say that those who carried heavy responsibilities in the department during the war, who were not permitted to enlist in the fighting forces because of the nature of their employment, lacked aviation experience, is an insult to them. The Director-General of Civil Aviation is stretching his authority a little too far when he says that such men do not possess aviation experience. On the form which applicants for appointment have to fill in, the first question is, "" How many decorations do you possess""? I agree entirely that ex-servicemen should be given preference in employment; but, in consonance with the views of the ex-servicemen's organizations, I believe that preference should apply only when all other qualifications are equal. Let us consider the case of the district superintendent at Darwin. Notwithstanding that his war experience extended only from Melbourne to Learmontb, in Western Australia, he was appointed permanently to that position over the heads of many men who have supervised airway services for many years. Administrative ability is the principal qualification required of a district superintendent. The position is largely a clerical appointment. In the clerical section of the Civil Aviation Department are many men who have had traffic, communication, aerodrome and aerodrome control experience; but they were not given an opportunity to secure the appointment.

That bill concerns itself with tinent when one recalls that it has not. a variety of matters. Perhaps the prinbeen at any time suggested that the existcipal of them is to be found in clause 4, ing airline companies wore incapable of which proposes to insert, a provision in dealing with the whole of the traffic the principal act dealing with cases where available. In fact they were capable of the Parliament of a State refers, or has dealing w it h it , and this was a gratuitous referred, powers to the Commonwealth, intervention on the part of the Governand, in particular, where the Parliament ment into the field of air transport. The of Queensland has referred powers to tlie loss on operations so f a r sustained is a Commonwealth. In substance, the Ausclear indication that, in competition with tralian National AirlinesB ill provides the major airline companies, Transthat the Australian National Airlines Australia Airlines has not yet been able Commission shall be able to conduct intrato establish itself on a really firm footing. state air services in Queensland. What may be done in Queensland may, of course, under suitable political conferences that have been made to the ditions, be done in any other State, financial aspects of this subject, but I and, consequently, the principle which is notice, with some interest, from the being established by this bill is one which report of the operations of Transmay lead to a complete monopoly of air Australia Airlines that the number of services all over Australia in the hands of paying passengers, which was 257 in the Trans-Australia the bill is a very important one.

136,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Loade r of one-quarter of its capital. If that goesremained substantially static during the first two operational quarters of this year. I wish to draw attention to a curious anomaly in the present civil aviation situation in Australia. We have, on the one hand, the Department of Civil Aviation, of which Mr E. C. Johnston is the permanent administrator, and we have, on the other hand, the Australian National Airlines Commission, of which the same gentleman is a director. The Department of Civil Aviation is charged with the responsibility of dealing with licences, permits to duplicate services, the introduction of fresh services and the like. It consequently occupies a kind of judicial position in that it determines certain functions. If an application is made for a new service or for the duplication of a service-as, in fact, was recently done in connection with a service between Melbourne and Wynyard, Tasmania-the Department of Civil Aviation determines whether the application shall succeed. How can it be expected that an unbiased attitude will be preserved when one of the persons required to make the judgment is a director of an airline which is also an applicant to the department? I do not make that remark by way of personal criticism; but it seems to me that Mr Johnston has been put in a false position, because he is at once a competitor for an application and the person who has to determine whether certain applications shall succeed. We have seen the result of this situation. It is well known, for example, that Trans-Australia Airlines, whose aeroplanes were by no means fully occupied, applied for a licence for this additional service between Melbourne and Wynyard and its application was granted, whereas the application of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited to provide a duplicate service to Wynyard was refused. The refusal was' based on the ground that there must be some conservation of petrol supplies. It is very diffito the Commonwealth on only a temcult, in these circumstances, to understand why the conservation of petrol required the refusal of one application and allowed the granting of another. Such circumstances must inevitably arise when, to put it figuratively, the same person is has, prior to the commencement of this section, both the advocate and the judge. I sugAfr. Alenzic*. gest very strongly to the Government that in order to obviate criticism that must arise in relation to these matters, such duplication of functions should cease. Either the officer to whom I have referred should devote all his time to the work of the Department of Civil Aviation and sever his personal connection with Trans-Australia Airlines, or he should devote his time to Trans-Australia Airlines and break his connection with the Department of Civil Aviation. There have been several instances of this kind of thing, some of which have been brought specially to my notice, but I do not need to refer to them, for the illustration that I have given adequately illustrates the principle to which I have referred. The next comment I make on the bill brings into view a situation in Queensland. It will be remembered that the Queensland Parliament and, indeed, those of one or two other States, referred certain powers to the Australian Parliament in 1943. ThoughI have not had a f u l l opportunity to check the terms of the Queensland legislation, my understanding of the matter is that the powers were referred to the Commonwealth by the Queensland Parliament for a limited period, which the Minister for Civil Aviation, in his second-reading speech, rightly said extended only until the 2nd September, 1950. The Queensland act, which carries the title "" Commonwealth Powers Act 1943 "", refers to the Commonwealth, in general terms, the powers which were subsequently the subject of a referendum in 1944. I direct attention to section 4 of the measure, which reads, in partThis Act, and the reference made by this Act, shall commence on the date upon which it is assented to, and shall continue in force for a period ending at the expiration of five years after Australia ceases to be . . . The powers, therefore, have been referred porary basis. Yet the proposed new section 19A, which, in the terms of this bill, it is desired to incorporate in the Australian National Airlines Act provides(1.) Where the Parliament of any State by any State Act, referred to the Parliament of tlie Commonwealth the matter of air transport, or the matter of the regulation of air transport, the Commission may, subject to this section, during the period of operation of that. vernment in Queensland, and it desired to State Act, or during any extension of that period [ emphasize the words ""during the period of operation of that State Act"". The Minister, in his second-reading speech on the bill, saidThe Government considers that it will be of direct benefit, not only to Queensland but to the Commonwealth as a whole, if the commission develops intra-state services within Queensland and other States, even though it is possible that these services, in view of their developmental nature, may be unprofitable in the beginning. This all adds up to a certain consideration. The only period within which the referred powers will operate will expire in less than three years' time. It is conceded that the establishment of air services will involve losses in the early stages. Yet Trans-Australia Airlines is to be authorized to establish intra-state services and to operate them in what must prove to be a loss-making period, and unless the Queensland Parliament extends its reference of .power for a longer period, Trans-Australia Airlines will not be able to operate its new services in the profit-making period. That is sufficiently curious in itself; hut another feature worthy of comment is that the bill provides a splendid illustration, which should be marked by the people of Australia, of the way in which an Australian Parliament which believes in socialist enterprises may co-operate with a State Parliament which also believes in them in what would otherwise be a Commonwealth instrumentality. Trans-Australia Airlines was established, according to its original charter from this Parliament, to conduct interstate services. Whether very many people believed it or not, the company was expected to confine its intention to such services, and it was said that what we described as private enterprise would have ample scope to maintain intra-state services. other words, it was said that there would be ample room for both activities. But we now see the pattern emerging under which Trans-Australia Airlines, with the co-operation of a State parliament which believes in socialist enterprises, is to operate, under referred powers, an intrastate service. No doubt, if a government which did not believe in socialist enterprises were to succeed the present Goterminate this arrangement, a view would be expressed in words something like these: "" That means that Trans-Australia Airlines will have to 'shorten its sails' and abandon its intra-state services, which would mean unemployment and serious dislocation"". A plea would be made to the State Parliament along those lines to induce it to continue the grant of power to enable Trans-Australia Airlines to proceed with its activities within the State. That emphasizes a view which I have often stated in this Parliament and on the platforms of this, country that, although a good deal of talk is heard at times about the inability of the Commonwealth Parliament to nationalize industries, such talk is meaningless because, by means of cooperation between a socialist Australian parliament and a socialist State parliament, industries could be socialized to the full 100 per cent. That is what could happen under this bill. The only other matter to which I shall refer is not completely covered by' any clause of the bill, but is nevertheless germane to it. A good deal of discussion has occurred in this chamber in the last few days about whether power may be referred to the Commonwealth on a temporary basis. The question arose when the Constitution Alteration (Bents and Prices) Bill was under consideration. It was said that it would not be wise to refer power to the Commonwealth for two years, three years, or five years, because there was some doubt whether such a limit of time could be placed on a reference of power. If those doubts arc well founded, what becomes of the power which the Queensland Parliament has referred to the Commonwealth for a period which will expire in September. 1950? Will the argument be that the time limit on the reference is invalid, In and that the Queensland Parliament, therefore, has referred these powers in perpetuity? That is one aspect to which I invite the attention of honourable members. Mr Horj.owAV -This is not a proposed alteration of the Constitution. anticipated my observations. I believe",38,Honourable Members Yes
137,Mr Menzies,"The Minister hasthat different arguments apply in the case of a reference of power by a State from those which apply in tlie case of an alteration of the Constitution by referendum. I have always been able to understand the argument that a time limit to a power referred to the Commonwealth by a. State is of dangerous validity, but I do not understand the force of the argument that a time limit cannot apply in the case of a power granted to the Parliament by the people in a referendum. If honourable members will consult the Constitution itself, they will see that it. is full of provisions containing time limits. For instance, section 87 saysDuring a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of customs and of excise uot more than uiie-fourth shall be applied annually hy the Commonwealth towards its expenditure. ginal Constitution. It is not an alteration of the Constitution. Section 93 of the Constitution contains these wordsDuring the first five years after the imposition of uniform duties of customs, and thereafter provides There is almost an abundance of provisions of that kind in the Commonwealth Constitution. By what argument can it be claimed that the people who created the Constitution, and put time limits in it, cannot change the Constitution by putting time limits in it? How does any question of validity arise? In what we call arguments in the High Court about constitutional validity, about whether an act is within the powers of the Australian Parliament, the standard by which legislation is judged is the Constitution itself; and if in the Constitution there is provision that the Commonwealth may control air transport for five years, or until or that the control prices until such and such a date, it cannot be said that such provisions of the Constitution are ultra vires, because the power by which legislation is judged is the power conferred in the"" Constitution itself. words, the Constitution itself cannot be unconstitutional. For those reasons I have never been able to believe that we in this Parliament, supported by a referendum of the Australian people, cannot, alter the Constitution by granting powers to the Parliament for five years or 50 years or 500 years. average layman would think. average constitutional lawyer would think; and, as the Minister is aware, .1 am not altogether a layman where these matters are concerned. While argument, may or may not arise about the time limit in the provision before us, there could never be ground for argument about a time limit introduced into the Constitution, the terms of which control all other laws. I repeat that nothing in the Constitution can be unconstitutional, because that would be a contradiction in terms. There has been an interesting and intense discussion on the activities of Trans-Australia Airlines, and on the position of the Commonwealth in regard to air services. I do not want to repeat what has been said, but to supplement it by my own observations. I protest against the short notice we have had of this bill. It is a far-reaching measure, find more time should have been allowed to consider it. In his second reading speech on the Australian National Airlines Bill, the Minister( Mr Drakeford) saidAnother clause amends section 48, which provides that the commission must give 30 days' notice of intention to establish a service. It ' is proposed that this requirement should iu future be limited to territorial airline licences applied for by Trans-Australia Airlines in circumstances which will bring into operation section 40 of the act. and thereby render inoperative any airline licence held by any other person by reason of the fact that tbe commission is providing an adequate service. such and such a date That amendment clearly foreshadowed Commonwealth may the end of private intra-state airlines. For its own good, Trans-Australia Airlines should have competition. Among other things, competition tends to protect the employees of Trans-Australia Airlines.

142,Until The Parliament Otherwise Mr Falkinder (Franklin) [8.6],"that, in their opinion, while there is active com petition, 'between Trans-Australia Airlines and private airlines, their own interests will be protected. That is an aspect of the matter which we should not overlook. There have been frequent references to the .M.elbourne-Wynyard air service. Trans-Australia Airlines has been given a licence to conduct this service on the score of petrol economy. I point out, however, that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was the pioneer of the service, and yet preference is to be given to a concern which began operalions only recently. The people in Australia want to see Trans-Australia Airlines do some pioneering. So far, it has allowed private companies to pioneer the routes, and has then taken over the-e ; which have proved profitable. Recently, f. asked in the House why Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited bad been forbidden to use D.C.4'« on the Melbourne-Hobart, run during the Christmas rush period. Permission was refused by the Department of Civil Aviation without any reason being stated, despite the fact that Australian National Airways 'Proprietary Limited holds a licence ro operate D.C.4's on the Melhoiiriie-II'obart run. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited has operated these aircraft on the run previously, and I should like the Minister to say why permission has now been refused. E support the. principle that a government-owned airline should operate in competition with private companies, and I think' most honourable members of thiHouse support it, also. T do not, however, believe iu destroying competition because, without competition, the government airlines will not improve, and tinstatus of the employees will tend to deteriorate. -There is only one redeeming feature about this bill, namely, that it opens the way for government-owned airlines to do some pioneering work in Queensland, at any rate. I agree with the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Falkinder) that if government-owned airlines are to be. of any use they should accept some responsibility for pioneering new routes. Hitherto, the government organization has contented itself with taking over routes after others have blazed the trail. According to pres.? reports, Trans-Australia Airlines proposes to take over a few new routes in Queensland. There are great distances in that State which make it very desirable that passenger and freight services should be established by airline operators, so that the isolation of the people may be broken down. Only in this way can the people be encouraged to remain in the outback areas. I notice, however, that Trans-Australia Airlines seems reluctant to institute a service to towns along the proposed routes, where aerodromes already exist, or where they could be easily made. Trans-Australia Airlines is taking the easy way, ami merely instituting through services from terminal to terminal. The people of Quilpie and Augathella have persistently asked for air services, 'but. without success. Such towns as Mitchell, Miles and Dalby a re rich centres of primary production; yet they lack air connection, and there .seems to be no possibility of their getting it unless the government-owned airline does the pioneering work. They have no hope for this reason: Et is now evident why the Civil Aviation Department has consistently refused to grant operating licences to those who had enterprise enough to want to open up these routes. It appears evident that the licences wenrefused so as to keep the way clear for the government-owned service to operate. Thus, we cannot get inter-town connection by private airlines because"" the department w ill not grant licences, and now Trans-Australia Airlines refuses to give the service which is needed. SoI am pressing the point, and that is the only comment which I desire to make on this bill, because all other aspects have been thoroughly discussed. I entered this debate for the purpose of pressing the claims of private enterprise to preserve its right to obtain licences to open up air routes, or for government-owned airlines to accept the responsibility and bear the cost involved in implementing these inland inter-town services. observations will be mainly on principles which are involved in the establishment, and conduct of a government-owned airline.

144,Mr Mcewen ( L N D I ) [3.16],"M ythat there is no justification on this earth for private enterprise, it is beyond argument that the grounds upon which the Government defends the establishment of government enterprises are few and identifiable. private enterprise has failed to give necessary secondly, that government enterprises can give better services than those provided by .private enterprise; thirdly, that the Government can give cheaper services than those .provided by private enterprise ; and, fourthly, that the government organization is established to protect the people against exploitation by private enterprise. Those grounds embrace all the arguments which can reasonably be advanced by any persons who admit the existence of government enterprise side by side with private enterprise. I shall examine whether any justification exists for the establishment of a government owned airline. The first question that I ask is: Is this enterprise established for the purpose of providing a service where private enterprise has failed to provide one? That cannot be the justification, because Trans-Australia Airlines has confined its operations almost exclusively to duplicating the existing services provided by private enterprise, and to reducing efficiency by making more acute the competition for business on the same routes. So the government airline is not justified on the ground of providing a service which private enterprise has failed to provide. Secondly, is the establishment justified on the ground that the government airline is providing a cheaper service than the private companies? Immediately we see that it is not, because the government airlines charge the same fares as the private companies. In fact, the Government has collaborated with certain powerful private airlines in an endeavour to force up charges. charged with price-cutting. there is no justification for the creation of Trans-Australia Airlines. It certainly cannot be claimed that TransA ustralia Airlines provides a better serlast few weeks? He has been trying to vice than that which is provided by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited or any other important air company. I do not say that the service provided by the governmentThey are, first, that owned airline is any worse than that of the private operators. I beand desirable services; lieve that it is fairly comparable, and on that count there cannot be any justification for expending millions of pounds of public money on providing a service which at the best can be described as only comparable with existing servicesconducted by private companies. Thirdly, can it be justified on the ground that it is established to provide services where private enterprise has failed or remained out of the field because of the lack of the profit motive? Of course, it cannot because this great government enterprise, with all the resources of the Commonwealth behind it, has studiously avoided providing a single pioneering service, and has confined itself to operating air services side .by side with the great privately owned airlines. Fourthly, can it be said that the government enterprise is established and conducted to protect the people of Australia against exploitation by avaricious private enterprise? If it could be established, that would be the best ground of all; but, of course, Trans-Australia Airlines, far from protecting the people against exploitation, is the great exploiter in air transport to-day. Private enterprise is operated on a scale of charges which the government-owned airline has not been able to undercut, and no evidence has been adduced that those charges yielded excessive profits to the private companies. On the contrary, the Australian Government entered into collusion with the only great air company in this country which is not entirely owned here, for the purpose of trying to cut the throat of the purely Australian owned company. That is undeniable. The Labour, party has spoken of exploitation by monopolies and cartels. A thousand speeches have been made on the subject. I ask: What has the Minister for Air( Mr Drakeford) been doing during the force the Australian-owned airline, Ansett",42,Honourable Members Yes

146,"Mr Mcewen""","On the second count,Airways Proprietary Limited, into a cartel by the threat that Trans-Australia Airwould still be an under-estimate. lines, acting in collusion with the great Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, would take away business from it. What use is it for members of the Labour party to talk qf monopolies, exploitation, profiteering and racketeering when the Government itself cannot do better than act in collusion with one private company to try to force an Australian company into a cartel! What justification can there be for any government to try to impose higher fares upon the travelling public by the threat of takbalance-sheet than he did. ing business away from a company and forbidding it the use of publicly owned aerodromes? Through the .petrol tax, the company has paid a substantial part of the cost of aerodromes. It is a blot upon the record of this Government that it should have established Trans-Australia Airlines in these circumstances. I am not one who has ever said, nor do I desire now to say, that there is no place in our public life for government owned enterprise; nor am I one ever to say that there is no place in our public life for government-owned monopolies. The test is the service which can be given to the people, and when that test fails, the case for government ownership and government monopolies fails. The best that the Government has been able to offer to the Australian public with this great enterprise, which has no capital liability reflected in interest obligations, provision for depreciation. To obtain and which has all the machinery and technical resources of the Government behind it, is the loss of approximately £500,000 on its first year's operations. I can only describe the balance-sheet as improper, because I cannot discover in it any provision for depreciation. If I am wrong, the Minister will correct me. He does not. Can a correct balance sheet be produced by a company which uses such a depreciating asset as modern aircraft, and which makes no provision for depreciation? Of course, it is fantastic. Having regard to the fact that a substantial number of the aircraft of Trans-Australia Airlines are old Douglas machines which have been modernized, a fair amount for depreciation would be receive for an expenditure in one year a substantial figure. To say that, overof more than £1,000,000? They get only all, the figure should be 20 per cent, £126,000 is shown. Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) has corrected me, so I withdraw my earlier remarks about the failure to provide for depreciation. ber has been corrected by his leader. leader knew more about the Minister's answer the honourable member's remarks is when I reply to the second-reading debate. That is further evidence of the honourable member's ignorance. memory serves me correctly, and the Minister may correct me now, is less than 10 per cent, of the capital value of the aircraft. Will the Minister attempt to justify that allowance in respect of obsolescent, refurbished aircraft? Of course, he will not. No private company could justify it. This is not a proper balance-sheet which would satisfy any business-like board of directors. If this is a "" cooked"" balance-sheet in one respect, I suspect it of being a "" cooked "" balance-sheet in other respects. It reveals, openly, a trading loss of more than £500,000 in the first year's operations. I am sure that it fails to make proper a reasonable figure, we should add at least £200,000. We should take into account the fact that no interest is charged to the accounts of Trans-Australia Airlines for its capital. The interest is, in fact, paid by the Australian taxpayer. The commission's capital is provided by a government which sustains itself largely upon loan money, upon which it pays interest. If we add interest, for which Trans-Australia Airlines is not charged, and reasonable depreciation, the true cost of Trans-Australia Airlines to Australian taxpayers for one year is more than £1,000,000.

In any ease, I point out that a number of honourable members opposite, including ibe Leader of the Opposition and the honhave advocated the granting of f u l l civil aviation rights to this Parliament. When the Leader of the Opposition held the portfolio of Attorney-General some years ago, he sought leave to introduce a bill for an act "" to alter the Constitution with regard to air navigation and airc r a f t "" . At that; time, all political parties wanted this Parliament to have f u l l civil aviation rights throughout Australia. wanted control, not ownership. evident that the Governmeni: is willing 10 allow its own airline to pioneer civil aviation in isolated parts of Australia, some of which have been mentioned by the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Adermann) and others, honourable memburs opposite raise doubts as to the legal soundness of such proposals.

Having accepted that advice. 11 proposes to do something that will be of value to the people, particularly those H ho live in isolated communities such as wore mentioned by the honourable member lor Maranoa. To those honourable members who said the Government had not, attempted to do any pioneering work in civil aviation, I point, out that the Government has not bad the right to undertake intra-state air services. I do not know how it could do any pioneering work now except by establishing intrastate, services, because interstate services are already well-established. I believe that there is a growing tendency for the States to give this Government, permission to enter the field of intra-state aviation. optimist. member is a pessimist. There was a time, when he was a member of the Senate and a Minister, when he advocated the granting to the Government of f u l l rights r,o engage in aviation activities anywhere in-Australia. The attempt that was made to secure those rights at that time failed. 1. have always favoured the extension of these powers, though years ago there was a division of opinion on this subject amongst members of the present Opposition, parties and even amongst members of the Labour party. This Government wants to pioneer aviation services in areas where they are needed, yet honourable members opposite criticize it for attempting to do so. The Queensland Government has been liberal in its outlook on this matter. There are areas in Queensland where air transport services could be established with great benefit to residents, No w , when it is and the Government proposes to make such services available. Honourable members opposite have criticized the Government, for introducing this measure just before the end of the sessional period. The time allowed for its consideration is sufficient for bills of this character. It involves certain important principles, such as the one mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, but those principles have been discussed in this House time after time. This Government believes that people in outback areas should be provided with transport, services and other facilities which will enable them to enjoy, as much as possible, the amenities which are available to city residents. It believes in decentralization. I.t, does not just talk: it acts, and it has brought about decentralization in many instances already by encouraging the establishment of industries outside closely populated areas.

His membership of the Australian National Airlines Commission has been of great value to the Government. The fact is that decisions in relation to licences are not made by. him as Assistant Director General of Civil Aviation, although that implication seems to have been conveyed. Such decisions are made by the Director General of Civil Aviation and by myself. As MinisterI take full responsibility for all of those decisions.

The standard of air services in Australia is equal to that of any other country. It should be maintained, and not brought down because of the desire of one operator to lower the standard in order to earn more profits than the operator providing a reasonable standard of comfort. brought down for honourable members. members opposite are quite prepared to accept free air travel from the Government, but prefer to use the aircraft of private companies instead of government aircraft. tables. bers would not be able to travel free on a privately owned railway. ter must connect, his remarks with the bill. honourable member for lndi and other honourable members who have alleged collusion between Trans-Australia Airlines and private airline companies to keep fares above the proper level, that fares in seater Skymasters are required to charge Australia, notwithstanding the 20 per cent, increase on the previously reduced rates, are still lower than they are in any increased seating capacity tends to lower other English-speaking country and, I think, any other country. It is the general practice for governmental control of air transport fares. Maximum and minimum fares are fixed. That is the practice in leading aviation countries, incomfort of passengers is also affected. cluding the United States of America and Canada. The United States of America is the ""home"" of competitive private enterprise. Most, if not all, international agreements on air transport provide for the fixing of fares. All Australian operators represented at the operators' conference in Melbourne expressed themselves in favour of governmental control. by all operators, except Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited, at the second conference. Its views were quoted in my statement, on the controversy with Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited. The dangers of a price war must be emphasized. Safety of air transport, depends upon meticulous attention to detail, and it is impracticable for any authority to completely enforce detailed precautions unless operators are imbued with and organized for that objective. Unprofitable operations that affect shareholders' dividends are conducive to skimping of safety precautions and to the overworking of staff. That has always influenced the Government's policy of giving comparatively liberal subsidies. Australia's record of air safety is good. Probably this has been influenced by the fact that operations have been as a rule profitable, largely because of the subsidies paid by the Government. Examination of the statistics of the United States of America appears to indicate a connection between the accident rate and the financial success of operations. On the matter of differential fares, I say that general acceptance of the principle of lower fares for lower standards of service must result in a general lowering of the standard of service. If one company lowered fares and standards of service competitors would feel compelled to follow suit. The objection to this is fully realized in the United States of America, where operators of 55 or 60the same fares as do operators of standard 44-seater Skymasters. Adoption of the standard of safety provisions, though perhaps not below the minimum standards laid down. That particularly applies to safety exits and such aspects as are affected by overcrowding.

I have great respect for the views of the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Tlie honourable member for Balaclava l-'alkinder) because he has rendered a distinguished service as an aviator. He referred to an alleged attempt by the Civil Aviation Department to prevent Skymasters controlled by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited front landing on the Cambridge aerodrome. partment refused to give a reason. plain.

So no distinction is being made between Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and Trans-Australia Airlines. that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited D.C.4's have used the Onrnbridge aerodrome. castrians. Both, are big four-engined aircraft requiring long runways. The Lancastrian was delayed at Cambridge until its engines were brought into perfect condition in order that it should have the power required to clear the nearby obstacle*.

I assure honourable members that no distinction is being made. I did not have the necessary in.forn.ia.tion when the honourable gentleman raised the subject yesterday, but later he received a letter showing clearly that no distinction is to be made. ( Mr White) made a rambling speech embracing all sorts of things. It was so rambling that it was hard to understand what he was aiming at. It was oue ef the most pettifogging speeches I have ever heard. He mentioned that I travel in an aeroplane. Men occupying positions similar to mine all over the world travel by air. Surely it would be regrettedI would regret it-if I were not able to provide for visitors from overseas facilities tliat have been accorded to me abroad. patronize the airlines like every one else? pettifoggery, the honourable member referred to the buildings used by Trans-Australia. Airlines. The hangar occupied at Essendon is rented from the Government. It also occupies the basement, ground floor and three other floors of the Manchester Unity building in Melbourne, for which it pays rent. So it gains no advantage in that respect. It also has to pay rent for the space it occupies in Phillip House, Sydney, and Terrick House, Brisbane. That effectively answers the honourable gentleman's suggestion that Trans-Australia Airlines receives favorable treatment in respect of its occupancy of buildings. Obviously, Guinea Airways Limited was satisfied with the compensation paid to it. The amount -was agreed upon between the Government and the company. It has not lodged a. complaint. The transaction, however, has been seized upon by the honourable member for political propaganda. I do uot think any one takes it seriously.

That is not true. know that it was not true at the time. because I did not. make a contradictory interjection at the time does not show that I did not know the facts. The Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) saved the honourable member from embarrassment. Trans-Australia Airlines have been certified to by the Auditor-General, who is under oath to see that nothing shall escape criticism that warrants criticism. The Leader of the Australian Country party made fantastic statements to the effect that Trans-Australia Airlines employed untrained and unsuitable staff. Its staff is as well trained and as suitable as that of any other airline operator. As for the statement that the members of its staff receive extraordinary salaries, I may say that, the salaries are comparable with those paid by private airline companies. Men in the lower grades are paid according to Arbitration Court, awards. So there is no substance in that claim. The honourable member merely threw another brickbat at this organization, which has done so well.' No -""peeial inducements were offered by the Australian National Airlines Commission to people to leave the employ of the competitors of Trans-Australia Air lines. There was a. rush of applicants for jobs with it . The chairman of the Australian National Airlines Commission, Mr Coles, told me that no inducements had been offered, and I believe him. What happened is that people recognized that a government airline offered them good opportunities. The honourable member for Franklin was good enough to concede that Trans-Australia Airlines offered a good service, but said tliat he thought competition was necessary to maintain its level. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) referred to the new service from Melbourne to Wynyard. The position about that is clear. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited refused to operate a service to Wynyard after the Stinson crash until it was made evident, that a service was needed. The people there claimed, and rightly, that they should be given a service; bur. apparently the private company thought there was not, as much profit in that service as in others, and declined I did. Merely to provide it . That sort of thing always happens when important communications are controlled by private enterprise. The company continued to neglect Wynyard, and the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons), the honourable memThe accounts of ber for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) and his predecessor. Mr Guy, and Senator Aylett continued to press for a service to be operated there to cater for the needs of the Burnie district. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, however, would not provide a service until it was made clear that the aerodrome was not unsafe. When the service was started, it: was found to be very profitable, with very high lifts. When, before petrol restrictions were announced. Trans-Australia Airlines applied for permission to supplement that service, it was granted a licence to do so, as the service provided by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was not sufficient to meet requirements. Instead of developing its own service, however, the company then complained that injustice had been done to it. There was no discrimination in this matter. Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited was operating one daily service with a high l if t . Trans-Australia Airlines applied to establish a daily service to Wynyard and the application was approved. The company later stated that an increased frequency of service would have involved the provision of two additional services, which were not warranted by the traffic either before or after the commencement, of the Trans-Australia Airlines service. It is clear that honourable members opposite who have taken part in this debate have not had an open mind on the subject. .Reference was also made to the alleged increase in the cost of meteorological services. It is common knowledge that meteorological and other safety services have greatly improved in Australia, as in other parts of the world, during the last few years.

199,Mr Drakeford,"these services must increase costs. Obviously, one cannot expect to get improved services for the same annual cost as had been incurred before the services were properly developed. Some criticism has been levelled against the Civil Aviation Department because of the increase in its staff. It is true that some aspects of the balance-sheet of the the staff of the department has been greatly increased. It is also true that during the war the department was cribbed and confined in such a way as to prevent it from rendering the services it desired to provide. Immediately after the war, when the services of men who had had experience in the Air Force became available, the activities of the department began to increase rapidly. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) referred to the amount of £24,388 appearing in the balance-sheet for superannuation. nine-months' period? scheme is a contributory one. The amount of £24,388 represents the combined contributions for the flying staff and for the commission for the year. The retiring age for pilots is fixed for 45. do they receive? largely on the amount paid into the fund by the officer concerned. The allowance would depend to some degree upon the salary received by the officer prior to retirement. A detailed examination of the records would have to be made to supply the information sought. superannuation pension was a very considerable amount and that it was used as an enticement to get officers away from the other services. honourable member that there is no truth in that. No attempt has been made to entice people from the other services. the superannuation pension is not out of line with that payable in other branches of the Commonwealth Service? payments made to men retired from flying operations are necessarily much more liberal than those paid to retired officers of the ordinary Public Service. A higher rate is fixed in recognition of the hazards of the occupation and the early age of retirement of pilots. I propose now to deal briefly with Australian National Airlines Commission, about which the honourable member for lnd i said I knew nothing.

That is not what he said before. what a great supporter of the honourable member for Wentworth said on this matter. I refer to the Sydney Daily Telegraph, which, in a leading article in to-day's issue, had this to sayTaking into account the heavy, inescapable expenses involved in promoting a new transport service, the loss is not surprising or excessive. quoting from the balance-sheet of the Australian National Airlines Commission. from the report which was made available to the newspaper just as it has been to the honourable member. Let us consider what an expert authority on aviation matters has to say in regard to Trans-Australia Airlines. In the May-June issue of the journal Aeronautics appears the following:Trans-Australia Airlines is certainly making a favorable name for itself. H o n o r a b l e members should let t h a t sink period of twelve months. Costs associated inEven the capitalistic press, which probably would like to be offensive about "" typical government inefficiency and extravagance"", has no complaint about the quality of its service. Whati t has cost to get the show going we do not know. Honourable members know now. continuesBut tlie expenditure of capital in obtaining equipment and in developmental expenses is unavoidable in any business enterprise. It will be soon enough to make a balance-sheet after the line has run for two years. So far it has run aircraft for only seven months, but in that time its loadings have leapt-well , skyward. nnsi First consolidated accounts of Overseas Corporation (Australia) Limited and its subsidiaries show a loss of £26,954 for the year ended June 30. Aggregate net loss from trading was £26,773, but net profits of subsidiaries amounted to £3,045. Depreciation amounted to £3,151 and directors fees £75. The point I wish to make is that on the directorate of that company are many well known people including Mr L. J. Hartnett, formerly general manager of General-Motors Holdens Limited; MrM . C. Lloyd, managing director of Eliza man Myer, governing director of Myer Emporium Limited; MrH . F. Richardson, managing director of Cox Brothers (Australia) Limited; and Mr J. S'. Storey, as managing director. These are men who are supposed to be first-class business men. Private enterprise frequently loses money in the first year of its operations. I believe that Trans-Australia Airlines has done a magnificent job for Australia, and that the Australian National Airlines Commission has presented to the Parliament and to the people a very creditable balance-sheet for the first nine months of its operation. The balance-sheet includes revenue for only a little over nine months, but the expenditure, shown in it is for the full with the inauguration of Trans-Australia Airlines are inseparable from the establishment of such an organization. When I was overseas representing Australia at the Civil Aviation Conference, I discussed the activities of Trans-Australia Airlines with people who understand aviation problems. They were surprised at the number of passengers which the service carried in such a brief period. They said that they did not know of any other airline which had progressed so satisfactorily or developed so speedily as had Trans-Australia Airlines.

At the end of the first year's operanow coming forward as the chief critic tions, the company had made a profit of £2,000. For the first half of 1937, it inis now in open competition with it. curred a loss of £8,600. For the year ended the 30th June, 1938, the loss was £9,000. For the year ended the 30th June, 1939, the loss amounted to £19,000. The capital of the company was £115,000. That is merely one of the airline companies that was swallowed up by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, which is a great airline operator but which was gradually becoming an airline monopoly. The Government is not. prepared to allow private enterprise to gain a monopoly in the air. It is worthy of note that the chief critic of Trans-Australia Airlines is its principal competitor, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. cism can be answered in a very effective way. While Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited presumably claims to voice current public opinion, there are grave doubts as to whether critiprobability of the smaller airline comcism emanating from a business competitor can possibly be classed as disinterested. The only conclusion to draw is that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited comes into the field to further its own publicity and deliberately to disparage its competitor. Had Trans-Australia Airlines been fortunate enough to be a going concern at the outbreak of World War LI., as.was Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, with the opportunity of reaping the benefits of the enormous war-time traffic, largely composed of government passengers and government mail, as did Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, it also would have emerged from the war years with substantial reserves and other advantages, such as aircraft written down far below their real value. When it *s realized that the present favorable position of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is largely due to the proceeds of government contracts starting with substantial subsidy payments in its early days, and including over £2,500,000 in' payment for the carriage of mails during the war years, it is indeed strange to have Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited of the Government-owned airline, which No doubt the profits, and hence the dividends, of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited will be much lower than in the pre-war years. It is also conceivable {hat the advent of Trans-Australia Airlines has had its effect in that connection. Is it then possible that this might be the main factor influencing the steady stream of scathing criticism directed at Trans-Australia Airlines on every possible occasion? Is it possible that the campaign is being waged in the vain hope that its ultimate effect will be the withdrawal of Trans-Australia Airlines thus paving the way to a complete private monopoly of civil air transport in Australia ? member had his opportunity to discuss this matter when the original Australian National Airlines Bill was before the Parliament. At that time there was a panies being swallowed by the large companies, and of a monopoly developing in Australia in air transport. I desire to refer to the provision made in the balance-sheet of Trans-Australia Airlines for depreciation, a matter that was referred to by the honourable member for lndi.

I would like to discuss other aspects of members shall use Trans-Australia Airthe subject, but I do not desire to enter into a protracted debate. Possibly certain issues will be raised at the committee stage. Having had considerable experience with Trans-Australia AirlinesI wish to say that as Minister for Civil Aviation, I am satisfied that Trans-Australia Airlines is doing a splendid job for Australia. That is also the view of the Government and of the large number of people who patronize Trans-Australia Airlines aircraft. The company is maintaining a high standard of service which is the envy of operators in many other parts of the world. I believe that the bill is in the best interests of Australia and that its passage will permit Trans-Australia Airlines to continue to extend its services info country areas and to operate in the widest possible sphere.

Mr H01T (Fawkner) [4.17] -As this bill contains a provision authorizing the Governor General to make regulations, 1 desire to refer to a subject which, in my opinion, is relevant to that power. I ask a direction from the Chair as to whether I may discuss this subject at this stage or whether the discussion should occur on the motion for the adjournment of the House. shall hear the honourable member for a few moments and then give him my ruling. intended that a regulation shall be issued compelling members of the Parliament who travel by air to use Trans-Australia Airlines aircraft exclusively. I do not know whether this is being done for the purpose of increasing the revenues of Trans-Australia Airlines, but the matter is one which should be discussed without delay. It is intended that honourable lines aircraft when they are available. I do not know whether the word "" available "" is to be interpreted to mean available reasonably near the time when the service is required by honourable members or available during the day on which honourable members desire to travel. The matter should be clarified. I am primarily concerned with the rights and privileges of honourable members and for that reason I desire to elicit the reasons which have caused the Government to make this decision. Honourable members are aware that when, earlier in this year, travelling arrangements of members came under consideration, a committee representative of all parties in the Parliament was appointed to deal with the subject. The committee sat under the chairmanship of Mr Speaker and the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) was present at its deliberations. I am not sure whether the Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Drakeford) was present, but I believe that the Minister for the Interior( Mr Johnson) attended. At any rate, representatives of the departmnts concerned attended the meeting. The committee made certain decisions with which the Prime Minister was in accord. A general understanding was reached that, while members were not to be limited to any one service if Trans-Australia Airlines aeroplanes were available to meet the convenience of honourable members, they should be used in preference to the aircraft of other airlines. In practice, honourable members have endeavoured to adhere to that provision, but there have 'been times when Trans-Australia Airlines aircraft have not been reasonably convenient. Speaking for the Victorian members-and I do so because I am best informed of the details that apply in their case-the aircraft of Trans-Australia Airlines leave Melbourne at 7.40 a.m., whereas the aircraft of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited service are scheduled to leave at 11.15 a.m. Honourable members who have to come to Melbourne from country districts or from",53,Honourable Members Yes

230,Mr Holt,"I understand that it issome of the outlying suburbs found it extremely inconvenient to travel by the Trans-Australia Airlines' Service, and consequently they used that provided by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. The practice, hitherto, has -been to permit members to travel to Canberra by the aeroplanes most suitable to them. We are now told that that situation is to be altered, not as the reproceed further along these lines. sult of a decision by the all-party committee, but by a decision of the Government. The decision has been made without the concurrence of the members of the committee. I consider that a decision of that kind should not have been made without consulting the committee. It should certainly not be brought into effect by government edict. Yet it appears that an edict has been issued. I protest against this method of dealing with the position. Private members of the Parliament have rights which should be respected. When an all-party committee has been constituted to deal with a certain matter, and it has reached decisions which have been accepted by the Government, those decisions should not be varied without further reference to the committee; yet in this instance the committee have been ignored. The convenience of all honourable ' members is involved. Certain wider considerations should also be brought to notice. During the regime of the Menzies Government, an instruction was issued that not more than three Ministers should travel together on any one aircraft. allowed the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) considerable latitude. He has made much more than a passing reference to a subject which, in fact, has nothing to do with the bill. further additional point to the attention of honourable members. During the membership of some of us in this Parliament three serious aircraft crashes have occurred involving the deaths of Ministers and members. Many honourable members prefer air transport to rail transport. Some others, I understand, consider that air transport is still somethat I would show up pretty badly in it. what hazardous. It was because it was considered that there were hazards still to here and now, anything that he wants to be encountered that the Government, of which I was a member, issued an instruction that not more than three Ministers should travel in the same aeroplane at the same time, and that instruction has been continued Chair has been tolerant to the honourable member, but I must now ask him not to in which 21 members of the Parliament may be travelling in an aircraft at the same time. It will be agreed, I believe, that that would be a circumstance of which the Parliament would not approve. nothing to do with the bill. be precluded from discussing this subject later on the motion for the adjournment, because it is of considerable importance to all honourable members. I believe that the rights of private members have been infringed. The subject should not be discussed on party lines. It affects all honourable gentlemen. to make only a brief passing reference to the subject raised by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), and I do so as a representative of a country electorate.

The honoraible member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) spoke for ten minutes on the matter, but I cannot allow it to be debated at any great length. power for the Governor General to make regulations on certain subjects. It has been stated by the Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Drakeford) that, under existing regulations, certain DC3 aircraft may operate carrying 28 passengers. They can fly only on a government licence. The issuing of a licence is tantamount to a declaration by the Civil Aviation Department that the installation of 28 seats in a DC3 aircraft is safe and prudent. Now, the Minister has said that, in his opinion, it is not safe, and he offered some reasons. said that it was less safe than other aircraft. safe. member for Balaclava ( Mr White) says, it. is either safe or not safe. It is highly improper, after a licence has been issued by the Department of Civil Aviation for the operation of aircraft, for the Minister in charge of the department to come here and smear the reputation of the company concerned by suggesting that its aircraft have only a limited degree of safety. I can think of nothing worse than that the Minister should, after his department has licensed the aircraft, and after he has been in personal controversy with the company concerned, come into this Parliament, and in circumstances where his words are readily disseminated member must get back to the bill. Mr Mx-EWEN 1 am on the subject of air navigation, and I cannot think of anything more pertinent to the discussion than the issue of licences for the operation of aircraft. member is referring to the issue of a licence to a company. The Minister has made a very ful l statement on the subject, which is item 20 on the notice-paper. There can be no further reference to it . to anticipate a debate on an item on the notice-paper, which will probably never be debated, anyway; but I was trying to answer the Minister's statement. I have made my point. I regard the Minister's remarks as highly improper. Clause3 confers power to make regulations regarding air services in the Northern Territory. The Minister resents criticism, either from honourable members of Parliament or from representatives of air companies, particularly if it is directed against the wild extravagance of the Australian National Airlines Commission. The Minister misrepresented me in connection with Guinea Airways Limited. He professed to misunderstand what I had said. He preI tended that an amicable arrangement had been reached between the Government and Guinea Airways Limited for the selling of the assets of that company to the Government. The plain fact is that the Government service tried to run Guinea Airways Limited off the route, and it was only some time later that the company went out of business, and sold its assets to the Government. I criticized the Government's intention to buy Convair aircraft now on order from the United States of America, upon which a deposit of £112,000 has been lodged in dollars. The Minister told me, in answer to a question, that British aircraft were not available, but when he was pressed he had to admit that Viking aircraft could have been obtained from Britain. He has admitted that it is proposed to expend 1,000,000 dollars on the purchase of Convair aircraft. Twenty-five engineers have been sent to the United States of America to learn to service these aircraft, but the machines themselves have not yet received a certificate of airworthiness in their own country. The Minister tried to brush aside the fact that he uses 360 gallons of petrol a week in an aircraft to carry him to Canberra, and he",55,Honourable Members Yes

I say that the order for Convair aircraft should be cancelled, and that the Chairman of the Australian National Airlines Commission should be dismissed, if he was responsible for giving HOLLOWAYthe order. Perhaps he only saw a model of the aircraft, because I do not think it was in operation when he was in the United States of America. Possibly, the idea of 40-passenger aircraft with two engines, and a pressurized cabin, appealed to him, but it is strange that no other firm here has ordered these aircraft. A royal commission should be appointed to inquire into the operations and activities of this octopus, which has sought to obtain absolute control over the air services of Australia. It was defeated only by a judgment of the High Court, which told it that it could operate airlines, but could not have a monopoly. Only a royal commission could bring out what the Minister has instructed his officials to do in order to achieve by other methods what he found it impossible to do by constitutional means. The present wild extravagance, as revealed by the balance-sheet of Trans-Australia Airlines, must stop. Already, £500,000 of the taxpayers' money has been lost. I again urge the Minister to say what he proposes to do about the Convair aircraft which have been ordered, and whether the person who ordered them is to be brought to book, if it is found that the aircraft are not up to standard, and British aircraft were available at the time.

The only question before us is whether this Parliament shall adopt the constitution which it cannot amend, and which has been itself the subject of discussion and approval at a conference of the International Labour Organization. In those circumstances, to discuss the measure at any length would be of merely academic interest. The Minister( Mr Holloway), in introducing the bill, pointed out that many of the changes were merely drafting changes, some of them made necessary because of the cessation of the League of Nations, and the coming into existence of the United Nations.

252,Motion By Mr Holloway) Read A First,"Ministerf o r Labour and National Service) [4.45 ] -by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this b ill is to amend and strengthen the Quarantine Act. Recent experience has shown that air travel has gravely increased the danger to which Australia is exposed by the introduction of quarantinable diseases. The additional risk rests largely on two factors, namely, the speed of nir travel and the fact that aircraft cross the seaboard and traverse the interior of the country. This bill has, in the main, been drafted to provide power to deal with these problems. So long as overseas traffic arriving in this country was comparatively slow and confined to the seaboard, the existing powers were sufficient; but, with the increasing volume and speed of air travel, a new concept of quarantine has emerged. It is no longer sufficient to watch for the appearance or the suspicion of disease in people arriving in this country, but measures must be adopted to ensure, as far as possible, that those who use international air travel are themselves unlikely to contract certain diseases and disseminate them in Australia. For this purpose, stringent requirements, in respect of .prophylactic measures, are imposed on people travelling to Australia by air. Certain difficulties have arisen in implementing these requirements, and these difficulties were emphasized during the recent quarantine at. Darwin of a flying boat, which arrived with a passenger who was suspected of suffering from cholera. The bill is designed to make the provisions of the act explicit in these matters, and to place beyond doubt the legality of the restrictions it is desired to impose. At this stage, I shall outline briefly the quarantine area, and would permit the problem which is facing our quarantine service. arrives in Australia a few days or even hours after leaving places in Asia, which are known foci of diseases non-existent here. W it h in the past three weeks, an aircraft from Shanghai landed at Biak next day, and 25 hours later was in Sydney. This aircraft carried nearly 40 people, who had spent varying periods in China. These people could conceivably be infected with small-pox, and remain apparently well until nearly two weeks after they had disembarked in Sydney and dispersed to various parts of Australia. No words of mine are needed to draw the attention of honourable members to the dire possibilities inherent in such a situation. This particular aircraf t crossed the Australian coastline somewhere in North Australia, and, for several hours, was travelling over the in terior of the country. There was risk of a forced landing, or deviation from the set course through conditions beyond control. On occasions, aircraft have been unable, on account of the weather, to make a landing at Darwin, and have been diverted to inland centres such as Katherine or Cloncurry. Consideration of these factors indicates that past conceptions of quarantine must be modified. No longer may quarantine be limited in application to first ports of entry on the seaboard. It must be made applicable to any part of Australia, and an organization to enforce it must be set up in various inland centres. It is considered that the amendments contained in this bill will provide the power necessary for this purpose. A further factor of great importance in this problem is the necessity for speed in applying the essential measures whenever and wherever they are needed. To achieve this, it is proposed to endow the Minister with emergency powers so that immediate steps may be taken to handle such a situation in any part of the country. It is possible that odd cases of quarantinable disease may penetrate even the most efficient defences. Such cases may appear in an isolated area, where there might be no properly developed control. The provisions of the bill would enable such a locality to be declared a imposition of the. necessary measures. It A person travelling by air may become necessary to make use of, or to take over the local hospital; to take over or establish a laboratory; to impose isolation or quarantine on the area; and to prohibit ingress to or egress from such an area. The general disease picture throughout the world at the present time is somewhat alarming. This situation is a common sequel to and corollary of war, and of the",57,Constitutio N Alteration
253,Mr Holloway (Melbourne P O R T S,"disturbed conditions which now exist in --so many countries in Asia and Europe. -Cholera is rife in Egypt, Pakistan and India, and these countries are traversed iby much of the air-traffic coming to Australia. Many countries in Europe and along the Mediterranean littoral are constantly reporting diseases, which were previously rare or non-existent within their borders. Typhus, cholera, smallpox and plague now regularly appear on the epidemiological maps of countries, which have been free of them for generations. It is proposed that, before embarkation for Australia, persons leaving certain areas, which would have been proclaimed as infected with a specific disease, amendments of the Quarantine Act are shall be ' properly protected by the appropriate vaccination or inoculation, and that they shall carry a valid certificate to this effect. To achieve this object, the bill proposes to place the responprotection of our own people, we should sibility, under heavy penalty, on the master and owner not to permit the transport to Australia, on their aircraft, of any person not in possession of the required certificate. The possibility must be borne in mind all honourable members hope that the new that other diseases, which do not present precautions will be carried out without an immediate threat to this country, may, crudity, and will not impose unnecessary at some future date, do so.

A few weeks ago, the Australian Government brought to this country, under its immigration scheme, a number of Polish soldiers, who had with them a dog which they valued and which had been with them through their campaigns. These immigrants had an understandable affection for the animal, but they were instructed to hand it over to the quarantine authorities, and, apparently without ceremony, it was destroyed. That practice should be abandoned, and we should return to the system which I have described. If an owner values an animal and is prepared to bear the expense, it should be kept in quarantine for a period, and released when all danger of disease and infection has passed. -Afte r a long period, the changed conditions of travel throughout the world have rendered it necessary to alter the quarantine laws of the Commonwealth. I was interested in the remarks of the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr tended. Holloway) regarding the entry of travellers into Australia through the Northern Territory. He explained that often, airpartment to examine the honourable memcraft from overseas landed, not at ber's suggestion.

I assume that, in that event, the area becomes a quarantine area for the purposes of this act, because I cannot believe that the Minister would allow an aircraft from overseas to land on a country aerodrome and then depart to a specified quarantine area. Proposed new section 12B provides that "" the Minister may establish and use laboratories and facilities for the diagnosis of disease for purposes of or incidental to quarantine "". I suggest to the Minister that if any suitable State facilities are available, the Commonwealth should not duplicate them. I hope that he will carefully examine this aspect. ber can be sure that the Commonwealth health officers co-operate with the States, assurance. I also urge the Minister to examine the regulations governing the quarantining of animals which enter Australia. According to my information, an animal from a country other than the United Kingdom or the United States of America must he quarantined, first, for a period in the United Kingdom, and. then for a long period on arrival in Australia. I agree with the Minister that we must take every possible precaution, against the introduction of diseases intothe Commonwealth, but we should not. impose unnecessary restrictions on the* owners of animals who desire to bring them here.

260,Mr Holloway (Melbourne P O R T S,"interim commission of that body. The object of this bill is to approve of Australia becoming a member of the World Health Organization and the acceptance by Australia of the arrangement establishing the interim commission. In order to appreciate tlie significance of this bill, it is appropriate to briefly review the steps leading to the formation of the World Health Organization. At the United Nations Conference on International Organization at Francisco on the 25th April, 1945, at the instigation of Brazil, the word "" health "" was introduced in the Charter of the United Nations. The conference also recognized the importance of health problems and their solution by approving unanimously a joint declaration proposed by Brazil and China for the purpose of establishing an international health organization. On the 15th February, 1946, the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations adopted a resolution calling for a Technical Preparatory Committee on Health, and for an international health conference to be convened. The Technical Preparatory Committee met in Paris on the 18th March, 1946, and prepared agenda for an international health conference. The proposals agreed upon were, circulated among all' members of the United Nations, and a resolution recommending participation, as observers, of nations not members of the United Nations at the International Health Conference was adopted. The international health conference met in New York from the 19th June, 1946, to the 22nd July, 1946. Delegations from all of the 51 United Nations took part in the deliberations, and representatives from thirteen non-member nations attended the meetings as observers. Concerning the role of existing international organizations dealing in the field Organization. The World Health Orof public health, it had been decided in Paris that the Office Internationale d'Hygiene Puhlique should be absorbed by the World Health Organization, and, the same action was agreed upon regarding the fate of the health section of the League of Nations and of the epidemiologic intelligence of the health section-of specific functions allotted by the Interth United Nations Relief and RehabiliMr Holloway. tation Administration. The conference decided that the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau should be integrated with the organization through "" common action based on mutual consent The following instruments were established at the conference:1. Final act of Uie International Health Conference incorporating a resolution regarding the activities of the League of Nations Health Office. 2. The constitution of the World Health San Organization. 3. Arrangement for the establishment of the Interim Commission of the World Health Organization. 4. Protocol concerning the Office Internationale d'Hygiene Pnblique. Representatives of all the United Nations signed the charter at the end of the meeting, China and the United Kingdom without reservation and the remainder of the nations ad referendum. Ten nations not members of the United Nations also affixed their signatures to the constitution. Nations which did not attend the conference will be admitted as members when their applications have been approved by a simple majority vote of the Health Assembly. The World Health Organization will come into being when 26 members of the United Nations ratify the signatures of their delegates. For the period between this international health conference and the first meeting of the World Health Organization, the conference set up an interim commission to conduct the essential business of the organization and to work out details of the agreements between the World Health Organization and other international agencies. The Interim Commission consists of eighteen nations, of which Australia is one. The representatives are all persons technically qualified in the field of health and they are charged with doing all the preparatory work for the World Health ganization is to be brought into relationship with the United Nations as a specialized agency. The Interim Commission has been established under the arrangement concluded for that purpose and is now functioning within the limits of the national Health Conference pending the final establishment of the World Health Organization. This bill provides for the approval of the deposit of acceptance by Australia of membership of the World Health acceptance of the arrangement establishing the Interim Commission. The more important aspects of the constitution of the organization are set out in the following parts of the first schedule of the bill:-The preamble states inier alia that health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, and that governments have a responsibility for the health of their peoples whicli can be fulfilled only by the provisions of adequate health and social measures. Article1 sets out the objective. Article2 sets out the functions. Articles 3-8 relate to membership and associate membership. Articles 9-42 deal with the organs of the organization. Article 43 deals with the head-quarters of the organization. Articles 44-54 and Article 71 deal with regional arrangements. It may be noted that the status of the South Pacific Commission w ill not be affected, since it was not in existence at the time of signature of the constitution. On the other hand, article 70 provides that "" the organization shall establish effective relations and co-operate closely with such other inter-governmental organizations as may be desirable "", and this will permit of suitable liaison to prevent overlapping between the two bodies. Articles 55-60 deal with budget and expenses. The membership of the organization is very wide, and it is not expected that Australia w ill be called upon to bear more than 1.79 per cent, of the cost. Estimates of the probable annual running expenses must at present be based on probabilities and analogy with other such organizations. 4,000,000 dollars has been suggested by the secretariat of the Interim Commission. This would mean, as a future maximum for the organization's budget, an annual contribution from Australia of 71,600 dollars. Articles 61-65 deal with reports submitted by member States. Articles 78-82 deal with entry into force. The foundation of the World Health Organization thus has been laid. It is appropriate that the first conference to be called by the United Nations was the Organization and for the International Health Conference which established the World Health Organization. This honour went to the field of public health and medicine and emphasized its role in the development of international peace. The. past emphasis on defensive measures is giving way to a new concept, a more positive attitude which seeks to broaden the knowledge and usefulness o.' health efforts. When nations enjoy good health in the broadest possible sense, the prospects of world peace will be greatly enhanced. It is on this premise that the World Health Organization was founded. One of the first tasks of the new organization will concern the scourges of man accentuated by the devastation of wrr. To-day, there is a new realization that the accomplishments of medical science, in the more technically advanced countries, must be shared with all nations. Beyond the immediate needs, the World Health Organization looks forward, by the pooling of such resources of all nations, to protecting the people of all nations from the ravages of disease, and to ensuring to every individual a standard of health compatible with the technical achievements of the medical sciences and the adjustment of his environment in combination with education. In short, it looks forward to "" the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health "" and well-being. It is becoming increasingly clear that medical science can contribute to man's ability to live harmoniously in a changing environment. Improved health enhances standards of living, promotes economic prosperity and contributes to the fundamental freedoms. Whilst the The figure of responsibility for health within its own borders is of .primary concern to each nation, the measure of success can be greatly increased through international team-work. The World Health Organization should be the co-ordinating agency to provide information, leadership and assistance in every phase of health work. Not only w ill it aid in disseminating and applying all of the known scientific knowledge to preventing disease and promoting health, -but also it will encourage and conduct scientific research to control disease. Cancer, heart disease, mental illness, malaria, tuberculosis, syphilis and degenerative diseases are obvious conditions for such international scientific endeavour. During the -past 40 years, nations have acquired some experience in international health action through efforts to prevent pestilential disease from spreading between nations. During the years between the two world wars, those efforts were broadened to include mutual help in disease control, in training of health perthe report of the Tariff Board on the sonnel, and in obtaining valuable statistics, and during World War II . the '""United Nations pooled fully their military efforts to prevent disease. Such experience will not be wasted. The prevailing epidemic of cholera in Egypt and in ""the newly created dominions of India and Pakistan strain to the limit the quarantine barrier of this coiuitry to prevent tthe introduction of disease. Because of Australia's geographical position in proximity to countries where epidemics of disease are so frequent and enhanced by movements of displaced persons, and because of the increasing speed of aircraft and the consequent greater risk to the people of this country of exposure to these diseases, it is imperative that quarantine practices should be standardized and supervised by an international agency. Australia played a considerable part in the setting up of the World Health Organization and has been a member of the Interim Commission since its inception. The World Health Organization is a collective instrument to promote physical and mental well-being, to control disease, to expand scientific knowledge and to contribute to harmonious relationships between the peoples of all nations. It is a powerful instrument in the interests of peace, and Australia cannot afford to do other than play its part in contributing to the accomplishment of the tasks that lie ahead. Twenty-one nations have ratified the deposit of acceptance of the instruments of the constitution of the World Health Organization and the arrangement establishing the Interim Commission and it Mr Holloway. is urgently required that Australia should ratify its acceptance of these instruments in order to ensure becoming a foundation member of this organization.

The subject-matter of the paper concerns one of the gravest issues that have faced Australia for some time. Opposition members have been attempting for a long time to obtain from the right honourable gentleman details of the dollar position in the world to-day, particularly as it affects Australia as a partner in the British Empire, but it has been shrouded in the greatest possible secrecy.

264,Mr Abbott (New England) [5.16].,"Britain of the dollars that were lent to it .by the United States of America. It contains a lot of padding but very little comfort for Australia. A good many aspects affecting Australia are not mentioned. I trust that in his speech in reply the Prime Minister will enlighten us much more than he has. One of the first things that strike any one who looks into the position is that it is impossible to dissect from the Statistical Bulletin, of the Oommonwealth Bank of Australia the position of loans, dollars, and London funds, because they are lumped together under the heading of "" Gold and Balances Held Abroad "". In May, 1946, after I had asked the Prime Minister many questions, we ascertained from him that the gold holdings of the Australian Government then amounted to £17.000.000. Doubtless, if we took into calculation exports and imports of gold since then, we could ascertain the Australian Government'3 gold holdings today. I cannot understand why the Government has not frankly stated the whole gold and dollar position as it affects Australia. The picture given to us by the right honourable gentleman is not at all clear. All we are told is that the position is getting worse and worse and this country must face continued rationing and the curtailment of imports from dollar countries. I . lay particular stress on the point that whereas Australia is one of the countries that could help more than many other countries to-day to rectify the dollar position, the very action taken by the Government will bring about a state of affairs that will prevent its rectia possibility of greatly increasing gold fication. This Government and the Government of the United Kingdom seem to think that the position will be remedied almost solely by restricting imports from the United States of America into Australia and the other countries in the British Commonwealth of Nations. too. of the British Commonwealth of Nations include Canada. The way in which to rectify the position is not merely to restrict the importation of American goods. Many goods, particularly capital goods, that we could get from America would if they were imported and used quickly tend to rectify the position. There are many commodities that could be exported from Australia that countries in the dollar area would not have the slightest hesitation in accepting. That applies particularly to the United States of America, which is the greatest manufacturing country in the world, and the country that above all others is capable of supplying the goods needed by the countries that are deficient because of the war. We could considerably increase the production in Australia of gold, coal, lead, zinc, copper and wool. Those are commodities that would be taken by those countries, particularly the United States, of America. A couple of days ago the chairman of directors of the Lake View and Star Mine Limited reported that, although the Lake View and Star gold mine had considerably increased production of gold in the last twelve months, it could increase production a great deal more. Gold is as valuable as dollars. It is the international currency. Despite our abandonment of the gold standard, the words of Virgil, "" The cursed lust of gold "", still hold good. The lust for gold is shared by people and governments alike all over the world. No government would refuse to take gold. With the importation of machinery from the United States of America and the application of a much more sympathetic policy by the Australian Government, the gold-mining industry could increase its output and, according to the chairman of directors of the Lake View and Star Mine Limited, which is in Western Australia, there is production. Coal is a headache to the Government. It always has been. The schedule of commodities and articles in respect of which import permits will be issued, which is contained as an appendix to the statement presented to us to-day, contains no mention of provision for the importation of the machinery necessary to work vast coal deposits in Queensland by the open-cut method. I understand that in the Blair Athol deposits there are reserves of coal amounting to 200,000,000 tons. No coal-field in the world has such a small overburden of soil, varying from 70 to 90 feet. According to the report",63,Dollar Deficits
265,Mr Chifley,"That is true of Canada,",64,Dollar Deficits
266,Mr Abbott,"The other countrieson the coal-mining industry made by Mr the United States of America has bought Justice Davidson, coal deposits that can be worked by the open-cut method are not limited to one field. Others, like the Callide deposits, are capable of great development. British thermal unit tests of those deposits show high results. 1 admit that there may be a high moisture content in. the Blair Athol coal, but that is not incapable of being coped with. yesterday, I understand that the company that is to work the field under an agreement with the Queensland Government has undertaken to produce 3,000,000 tons of coal annually. The other fields in Queensland could be similarly exploited. There is no great difficulty in open-cut propositions. As I know from my experience of the open-cut operations at Muswellbrook, they can be quickly developed. The company that is to operate at Blair Athol counts on placing coal in bunkers at Queensland ports at a cost lower than anywhere else in the world. Tbe cost would be about one-eighth of the landed cost of the coal. The coal would be welcomed in Argentina and other South American countries, and even in a coal-producing countiy like Great Britain. Essential to the production of the coal, I understand, is earthmoving and coal-winning machinery, which has to be imported from the United States of America. It looks as if some one has badly blundered by omitting from the list of goods for the importation of which licences will be issued the machinery needed to win the coal that would alleviate the dollar shortage. tion been made for it. that no provision is made in the list for tlie importation of such machinery. been made for the importation of such machinery. assuming that an application would be sv.mpathetically received? necessary for essential production is imported without restriction. production of lead, zinc and copper could be similarly expanded. The doleful, gloomy document presented by the Prime Minister says that less wool from Australia this year than it did last year, and that, presumably, it will buy less in subsequent years. So this year Australian wool has not earned so many dollars as it did last year. I say that in reply to the statement that the United States of America wants highquality wool tops for spinning. Only according to newspaper reports, an Americanbuyer paid the record price of llO^d. per lb. for 5 bales of greasy wool at the Newcastle sales. The wool was the leading line of the well-known A.S.N. Marani from Walcha. An average of 70d. per lb. was paid for all but two lots of the total clip, which was described as probably the best clip ever offered at auction in New South Wales. America will pay for high-class wools. Unfortunately, this year a large part of the Australian clip is in a faulty condition owing to the drought that prevailed in eastern Australia. Consequently, our wool is not so suitable for American uses as it otherwise would have been. But there is no need for the despairing terms of the Prime Minister's statement. I believe that we can do a great deal to alleviate the dollar shortage. The dollar loan by the United States of America to Great Britain, whicb was supposed to last for three years, lasted, according to documents presented to the House of Commons and the economic survey made this year, less than twelve months. But a large part of it was spent buying food, tobacco and other things from the dollar area that could have been supplied by British countries. If the Empire countries supply these goods in quantity to the sterling area so that the people in that area would not have to turn to South America and North America to procure them, an enormous strain would be taken off the dollar pool. Consequently, there would be a much more rapid approach to the day when there would be free convertibility of sterling throughout the world. We should do everything possible to increase our exports to the sterling areas. We are now reaping one of the largest wheat harvests that Australia has ever produced The season has been most bountiful and the crop is exceedingly heavy.

272,Mr Abbott,"Good! No doubt thewill be well in excess of 200,000,000 bushels. India is now negotiating with the Australian Government for the purchase of approximately 40,000,000 bushels of wheat. The export price of wheat, f.o.b. Australian ports, is approximately 19s. 6d. or £1 a bushel. If this transaction is completed it will mean that Australia will be given credit to the value of approximately £40,000,000 by India for the purchase of that wheat. India already has frozen balances in the United Kingdom amounting to £1,200,000,000 sterling. We would be foolish if we simply said to India, "" We shall sell you 40,000,000 bushels of wheat and you can pay us in sterling in the United Kingdom which is inconvertible into dollars "". For many hundreds of years India has absorbed the gold and silver production of the world for the hordes of the East. It was disclosed in a paper published by the Indian Congress party, prior to the granting of self-government to India and Pakistan, that the hoards of jewellery held by the princes and ma.harajas of India represented one of the greatest accumulations of wealth the world has ever seen. The time has come for plain speaking. We should say to India, "" If you want our wheat, you must pay for it in dollars, in gold, or in jewels'"". with private property in that way. says, ""We could not interfere with private property in that way "". Yet, every day in this Parliament the right honourable gentleman gives a concrete example of how untrue is that remark by being busily engaged in socializing Australia and interfering with the rights, liberties and privileges of private citizens. always knew that the right honourable gentleman was a humourist. It is obvious that he is already feeling the happy spirit of Christmas when he makes such a jocose remark. We cannot produce the goods with honourable gentleman states that the which to obtain dollars to offset the dollar United Kingdom authorities requested position unless we bring more immithat Australia should undertake to live grants to this country and provide within its current dollar income, and to housing accommodation, first for our own make no net claim on the United Kingpeople and then for the new arrivals. I dom for dollars. That adjuration is all was astounded at the lack of thought very well in theory, but I remind the given by the Prime Minister to the right honourable gentleman that many subject of import licences for the imAustralian primary products are sent portation of capital goods into Australia. Earlier this afternoon the right honourable gentleman said that there would be no curtailment of the importation of capital goods into Australia. I am afraid that the right honourable gentleman's memory is not as good as it was when he sat with me as a member of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems. Only yesterday, in answer to a question by me in relation to the importation of tractors, the right honourable gentleman asked whether I was referring to heavy tractors or agricultural tractors. I informed him that I was referring to tractors of both types. He then said that heavy caterpillar tractors would not be admitted. He must know that the supply of timber for the housing programme of the Australian and State Governments is dependent to a degree upon heavy type caterpillar tractors, fitted with winding gears which haul the logs up the slopes in the forest areas to the roads along which they can he transported to the mills. Conditions to-day are vastly different from what they were in the old days when timber stands adjacent to the roads had not been cut out and haulage was done by bullocks. To-day, most of the timber lies in places inaccessible to anything but tractors of the caterpillar type. The right honourable gentleman demonstrates a lack of understanding of the interests of the nation when he shows hostility towards the importation of tractors of that type. Open cut work to-day is done by means of tournapels. Caterpillar tractors are used to pull them when filling. They are also used to drag the rippers through the overburden above the coal seams. Yet we I are told that heavy tractors of the caterpillar type may not be imported. Some of these restrictions are too ridiculous for words. On page 9 of his statement, the right",65,Dollar Deficits

274,Mr Abbott,"The Prime Ministeroverseas to the ITnited Kingdom and Ireland to be manufactured into goods which are subsequently exported to tbe United States of America. That applies particularly to the raw materials for the woollen textile industry. Great Britain is doing everything possible to improve its dollar position by an export drive to the ITnited States of America and other dollar markets. Every piece of woollen cloth that is shipped into the United States of America has a raw wool content which is taxed by the American authorities, which also impose customs duy on to the added value of manufacture. There is no difficulty in ascertaining the value of the raw wool content of any woollen piece goods. I believe that the United Kingdom would be prepared to make some portion of the value of that raw wool content available to us in dollars-say , 50 per cent, of it. The more capital goods we are able to produce in Australia the better we will be able to assist the United Kingdom to right its desperate position. On page 12 of his statement, under the heading "" Conclusion"" the right honourable gentleman saysThe Government regrets the inconvenience and hardship which the cancellation of import licences and other dollar conservation measures have caused in .the field of industry and commerce. It feels confident, however, that the Australian people as a whole will support the action taken, since failure on our part to reduce dollar expenditure would inevitably increase the much greater hardships which arc at present being endured by the people of the United Kingdom. I am convinced that the action being taken by the Government will bring about a worse state of affairs, not only in the United Kingdom, but also in Australia. We should increase our exports to dollar and sterling areas, adopting a somewhat similar course as is taken in connection with payment for our petrol imj>orts. Petrol imported to Australia from sterling areas is paid for in dollar currency collectible in the United States of America. When we sell our wheat to India and otter parts of the Empire, and to Prance, all of which have assets in America, we should stipulate that payment be made by making an appropriate portion of those assets available to us for the financing of our urgent requirements. The time has come for Australia to raise Mr Abbott. a dollar loan in the United States of America and to use the proceeds purely for the importation of capital goods required for the rapid development of our industries. The action taken by the Government to meet the dollar crisis i9 extremely unlikely to bring about the golden age about which the Prime Minister spoke so glibly last year; rather will it bring about a depression. If a depression overtakes us, the guilty men will sit on the other side of the House. vernment's economic policy in relation to imports from dollar areas has become a matter of great and grave urgency. Full consideration of this subject by the Parliament cannot be deferred any longer. Parliament should discuss it now. The Government is bungling and hesitant. It has no positive approach to the dollar question. Yet it is prepared to allow the Parliament to go info recess, neither the Parliament nor the country knowing what the future may hold. We have a very grave responsibility to the nation. I would be lacking in my duty to the country, to the Parliament and to my constituents if I did not express my views on this subject. The responsibility is, of course, the Government's; but the Parliament should see that the Government does not shove this country headlong into a crisis that will mean industrial stagnation, the destruction of overseas trade and unemployment in many of our key industries. If necessary, the Parliament should remain in session until the Government has produced its plans to meet the crisis, and until the Parliament has approved or otherwise of such plans. The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has told the Parliament and the country that the position is serious. We might call it a crisis. The present policy of the Government can end only in an artificial dollar depression. It will wreck our trade with the United States of America and deprive many of our industries of critical supplies, leading to complete dislocation and a progressive breakdown in our Australian economy. Yet the only explanation we have before us is the paper tabled by the Prime Minister, and it is only a confusing hotch-potch of tangled figures which does not touch on our actual dollar",66,Dollar Deficits
275,Mr Lang (Reid) [5.4.2],"The Goposition. Typical, indeed, was the Prime Minister'9 attempt to define the petrol position. He admitted that most of our supplies come from countries in the sterling Hoc Yet, because other parts of the British Commonwealth draw from dollar sources, Australia's supplies are apparently charged against the dollar pool. Have other calculations been made on the same basis? Every balance-sheet of our trading relations with dollar countries must, according to that standard, be based on theoretical calculations. No one, I do not care who he is, can tell how much the United States and Canada will buy from this country during the coming year. No one is in a position to foretell the trend of prices, either of exports or imports. Those are tlie real determining factors in arriving at the future trade balance. But the Government is acting on the assumption that the past is a rigid index of future exports. It has no elasticity in its the Australian. But it should also mean assessment of the position. It appears to me that the Prime Minister and the Government assume the worse. The Government is plainly attempting the impossible.

There is only one gap to bridge. That is the dollar gap. This House and the country how he proposes Government mulishly persists in acting to enter into the commitments of articles as if there is only one way to deal with the dollar position. That is to destroy our growing trade with the United States. Our trade with North America has never been more buoyant. We are obtaining record prices for our exports. The existing exchange rate operates in our favour. According to the Government's own supporters, the purchasing value of the dollar has depreciated much more than the purchasing power of the Australian £1. The truth, of course, is that wage levels are much higher in the United States, with the American typist averaging £15 a week, rail employee from £15 to £20 a week, and other workers on a corresponding level, when considered in relation to the Australian £1. If the American worker is getting twice as much as the Australian worker, and he pays twice as much for what he needs, then the relative position of the American should be the same at home as that of that this country should be able to sell in the American market, and obtain all the benefits of the ruling high price levels there. It should mean that our industries are now in a position to compete with American industries, not only in the outside market, but also on the home market. That is the realistic approach to this problem. It is the one approach that this Government refuses to make. When we impose quantitative restrictions against American imports into AusI invite the Prime Minister to tell the 20, 21 and 22 of the proposed charter of the International Trade Organization and whether he also intends to apply even more rigid import restrictions against imports from dollar countries. Neither this Government nor any other government can have it both ways. The Government either believes that it is in the interests of this country to enter into commitments imposed by the charter of the International Trade Organization, or it must announce its intention to adhere to unilateral action. Its present policy is incompatible with the policy announced by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) and his participation in the Havana Conference. If the Government intends to go on with the proposed increase of restrictions on trade, then it should face up to the Havana position. It should recall the Minister immediately. Under the draft charter, there is an urgent problem of positive Australian obligation to consult with other members trade action to exploit the American before applying restrictions to trade to dollars available to trade emissaries to ascertain whether alternative corrective sell British goods on the American measures are available.

To suggest that the American Government will not co-operate on this problem is just as absurd as would have been the failure of that Government to use this country as a base during the war. Eveni f the United States has all the gold and all the dollars, it is still not in a sound position. Like the little boy who won all the marbles, it must provide a stake to others, otherwise there will be no further play. That would mean a quick breakdown in American economy. Surely, trade with Australia, which has so much that the United States needs, is one of the attractive propositions offering.

276,Mr Lang,"It is not necessary to-dayinto the vicious circle of a scarcity economy. The Government, itself, refused to take any positive action to meet the crisis. London financial writers say they are mystified by the government's policy on dollars. They cannot understand the sudden panic. If those at the very centre are mystified, how much more mystified are the Australian people, who are on the outer fringe, vainly seeking some explanation of all the mumbo-jumbo about dollars. If the. Government fails, or if it no doubt, in the form of luxury items, surrenders to dollar pressure, then this country is headedfor a depression far worse than that of the early 'thirties. It is the responsibility of this Parliathe war, and afterwards, the Australian ment to see that it does not happen again. No honourable member can shirk his personal responsibility. No honourable member can afford to ""' pass the buck "" to a Treasurer, who is plainly bewildered and befuddled by the onset of the crisis. What is needed is bolder thinking and more aggressive action. The Government must not be allowed to abdicate to the so called financial experts, and the monetary theorists, twice in one generation. It is a job for this Parliament, and it should be tackled immediately. The Parliament should not go into recess until the position has been clarified, and a considered plan to meet the crisis has been approved. Minister and Treasurer) [8.5] -in reply -The honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) put up a few bogies, and then attempted to destroy them. He spoke of the development of the coal resources of Queensland by a British company. That is a matter for negotiation between the company and the Queensland Government. He suggested that development was being held up because of the lack of equipment which could be obtained only from the United States of America. I understand that, so far, proposals have not gone beyond the stage of negotiation, and that, before production can begin, railways must be built and wharfs constructed. Considerable plant would have to be provided if the Blair Athol field is to be developed, but, so far as I know, no application has been made for capital Equipment. In order to understand the Government's attitude towards the dollar shortage, it. is necessary to go back to the time when Sir Kingsley Wood was Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain. For a long time, the United Kingdom had been selling foreign securities in order to finance the war, and was thus losing its income from foreign investments. This income had formerly come to Britain in the form of food and raw materials, and, also. It did not require any one of great sagacity to forecast that if this process was continued much longer, economic difficulties must inevitably arise. During Government maintained restrictions on the use of dollars. I realized that the Government of the United Kingdom, operating under the Anglo-American Loan Agreement, was bound by certain obligations whicli did not apply rigidly to Australia. We have guarded, so far as we thought reasonable, against the undue expenditure of American dollars for goods and equipment. There is nothing very mystifying about the position. It is true that the situation has deteriorated very rapidly during the last eighteen months. The loan that Lord Keynes negotiated on behalf of the British Government with the Government of the United States of America was not as large as the British Government wanted. The terms of the loan were generous enough, but some of the conditions attaching to it I regard as very onerous. It was hoped, however, that the loan would be sufficient to maintain the Empire pool of dollars long enough to allow certain things to happen. The first was the rehabilitation of British industry, and the development of the British export trade; the second was the rehabilitation of Europe, which would have provided a market for British goods, and would have supplied other goods in return. This hope was defeated by the disastrous inflation of prices in the United States of America, which meant that the quantity of goods which could be bought out of the loan was much smaller than had been expected. Moreover, the price of goods bought from Argentina, and other hard currency countries, rose in some instances by 150 per cent., and",69,Dollar Deficits
277,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Prim eprices generally increased by 40 per cent. Tbe second factor -which, helped to defeat the original plan was that the rehabilitation of Europe has not proceeded as was expected. I do not intend to survey the appalling conditions which prevail in Europe, particularly in Germany and France and, in only a lesser degree, in Italy. Sweden and Holland conditions are somewhat better, but rehabilitation in the major countries of Europe has not been carried to the point that we had hoped for. Far from France being able to produce many of the articles that Great Britain expected to receive, that country has not been able to produce even enough food for itself, and is trying to import food, including wheat from Australia. For some time, climatic conditions in Great Britain were disastrous, a fact which added to that country's troubles. For a considerable time, more than 2,000,000 of Britain's men were overseas on military duty in various parts of the world, and it was not possible to withdraw them immediately, although that is now being done as quickly as possible. Those men were not producing, and some of them-those and Egypt-were from the American loan for their upkeep. The honourable member for New England told us what we ought to do in the way of exporting commodities in order to earn dollars. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang) discussed the same topic, and then spoke of "" the mumhojumbo about dollars"". speech, he spoke of being realistic. That is exactly what the Government is trying to be. It is true that we could export to dollar, or hard currency, areas a quantity of goods and commodities that we are now either using ourselves, or are sending to the United where they are sorely needed. I have discussed this matter with the Minister lard), and I know something about it of my own knowledge. I have gone into it very fully, and if I do not understand the subject, it is not for lack of study. We could, no doubt, export more goods for hard currency to areas such as the Philipto pay excessive prices for them. Many pines, China, Panama, South America and to Switzerland. But we must never Mr Chifley. lose sight of the fact that, for a number of reasons, we owe a great responsibility and duty to our ally, the United Kingdom. One reason is that the British are a great nation with wonderful traditions. During the last seven or eight years they have shown a magnificent spirit. They bore the brunt of the catastrophic war In such countries as Belgium, from 1939 until 1945. To-day, they are in most difficult circumstances. A second, and very material, reason is that the United Kingdom has been Australia's greatest customer. Therefore, we cannot lightly brush aside our duty to the United Kingdom. Australia is one of the countries which made the least economic sacrifice, and suffered least in World War IT. Are we to deny to the United Kingdom wheat, butter and other goods which our kinsfolk urgently need because they can offer us payment only in sterling? If we decided to withhold those goods so that we should not make any sacrifices, we should increase intensely the economic difficulties of the United Kingdom. The Australian Government is not prepared to do that. Unlike some people, we do not go through the country waving the flag and mouthing platitudes about kinship and the silken bonds of Empire. We like in Germany, Palestine to demonstrate our alliance with our drawing upon dollars greatest friend, and with the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, by taking practical measures to help them. Two problems arise. One is whether we should export to the dollar area certain materials and commodities in short supply here, which the United Kingdom Earlier in his does not particularly require but which we ourselves badly need for our own industries. In the hard currency countries we could sell cement, steel, constructional steel, steel rods and timber. But if we did so we should accentuate the scarcity of these materials. One of the great problems now confronting the Kingdom, people of the United States of America arises because America has exported such enormous quantities of goods as to produce a shortage in the domestic market. That has accentuated the inflationary spiral. Because of the enormous volume of exports, many goods are in short supply, and, with the abolition of prices control, the American people are obliged factors are related to this situation, but I do not propose to deal with them at",70,Dollar Deficits
278,For Commerce And Agriculture ( Mr Pol,"length in this discussion. We must examine the problem as realists. We desire to extend to the United Kingdom all possible assistance, while striking a fair balance in order to ensure that our own people do not make undue sacrifices. This course is to be preferred to seizing every opportunity to sell our exports in the hard currency and dollar area. The United Kingdom, which urgently needs these goods, has been, and will be, our greatest customer for decades. Are we to ignore the plight of the United Kingdom because some temporary customer requires these goods and is prepared to pay dollars for them ? Are we to deprive our greatest customer, friend and ally of those goods? We must weigh all these factors realistically. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) is deluged with requests from other countries for Australian goods. Most of these goods happen to be urgently required on the Australian market. Emergency Food Council considers that Australia's exports of food should be allocated in a fair proportion to the needs of the people who require them. The United Kingdom is a party* to the International Food Council. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture could readily find markets for our wheat in China, for which we would receive payment in American dollars, or in Switzerland, for which we would h-"" 1 paid in Swiss francs, and for other goods in the Philippines or Panama. But would we be giving our British allies a "" fair go"" if we withheld these goods from them, because other countries arc now prepared to pay high prices for them? If we sold these goods and commodities in 'China, Switzerland, the Philippines and Panama, the people of the United Kingdom and Australia would not have adequate supplies. Therefore, we must strike a balance. The Minister has been examining the subject very closely for the purpose of ascertaining whether we can export goods without doing an injustice to the United Kingdom and disrupting our own economy. Let me tell honourable members that easy for us to preach about lofty ideals, there is no mumbo-jum'bo about the dollar and what the United States of America shortage. Again, they must be realists. should do. Personally, I have a someWhat is the real source of the trouble? what scanty knowledge of the United The value of the goods which the United States of America has exported is approximately three times as much in dollars as> the value of the goods which it has imported. To that situation, there can be only one answer. We do not have to be economists, theorists or politicians to reach the conclusion. For this calculation, one needs only an ordinary knowledge of arithmetic. This form of trade must have violent repercussions. I do not condemn the United States of America. Some people in Australia would like to tell the Americans how to conduct their own affairs, but I have always believed, as a politician, that we should leave to the people of another country the determination of their own policy. We have enough troubles of our own to occupy us without preaching to people in other countries as to how best they can govern themselves. Had it not been for the assistance of the United States of America, in. World War II . , Australia might have been conquered by The International the Japanese. When we begin to examine this problem we discover there are many matters which must be studied. If the value of the exports of a country are three times the value of its imports, there can be only one result. The United States of America has made great contributions in order to assist other countries, and the maintenance of Japan to-day is costing an enormous sum. America has poured out billions of. dollars, and perhaps some doubt may be expressed as to the wisdom of the way in which the money was expended.. However, this granting of assistance is a tribute to the American Government, the Department of State and people who have some appreciation of the enormous problems now confronting the world. It would be easy for me to say, as one standing on the side-line, that the only course which will remedy the situation is for the American people to make the most magnificent gesture that the world has ever seen. That idea is not easy to sell to all the American people. When we are situated so far away from America, it is States of America. It is a great nation, and embraces people of all classes. Some live great distances from others, and have totally different outlooks on many international problems. For example, the people in the middle west have a strong isolationist outlook. ""We recall the great difficulties which American statesmen experienced in bringing the United States of America into World WarI . During World War II . , President Roosevelt inaugurated lend-lease for the purpose of assisting the allies. Lend-lease, in my opinion, was one of the greatest acts of statesmanship that the world has ever known. Roosevelt when he inaugurated lend-lease had the wholehearted support of one-half of the American people. However, he believed that he was doing something for the preservation of liberty and the salvation of mankind and, perhaps, was saving civilization; and, therefore, he was prepared to stake his political future and reputation on time and events justifying that magnificent gesture of lend-lease. It is not always easy to convince a majority of the people of the right policy to adopt in relation to other countries. That is one of the great difficulties which American statesmen are facing to-day. I make no criticism of that. It is for the Americans, as people living in a democracy, to choose the course which they think fit. I doubt whether the honourable member for Reid was sincere this evening in making some of the statements that he did. I have a knowledge of his ability to understand these problems, and [ know that he is not so unintelligent as not to be able to appreciate the difficulties inauspicious time to attempt it. Howthat confront the United Kingdom and other countries which require goods from the dollar area, but which have not got sufficient dollars to pay for them. I believe that the honourable member's speech this evening was unworthy of him, and was made for the purpose of political propaganda. It would not matter whether the Leader of the Opposition Menzies) or any one else was in office at the present time. He would have to face the reality that Australia could not get goods from the dollar area without paying for them. Ur. Chifley. barons are not philanthropists. They do not manufacture motor vehicles, cotton textiles and tractors with the idea of presenting them to us free of charge. The conditions attached to the AngloAmerican loan contained a provision for convertibility of sterling balances, a» subject to which the honourable member for Reid referred. India, Egypt, Australia, Southern Ireland, New Zealand., and South Africa had all accumulated enormous sterling balances in London.. They were all in a position, given good seasons such as we are now experiencing,, to earn a great amount of current, I doubt whether President sterling. That is also true of Argentina,, a country which was exporting goods toGreat Britain and charging very high prices for them. As a matter of fact,, some of the South American countries were charging bush-rangers' prices for their goods and thereby accumulatinghuge sum3 of current sterling. When the convertibility provision of the AngloAmerican loan commenced to operato, those countries immediately rushed in to obtain dollars. Between the time when this rush began and the time when the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the United Kingdom had to announce that dollar conversions must end there was an enormous flow of dollars from the British pool. The drain was so severe that it had to be stopped, despite the provision in the terms of the Anglo-American loan. Beady convertibility of current sterling earnings into dollars was one of the ideals mentioned by the honourable member for Reid. The attempt to give effect to that ideal was made in bad circumstances. I admit that there could have been no more ever, the experiment was tried and, from the point of view of the United Kingdom, it proved to be very disastrous. Since then, the prices of goods in hard currency areas have continued to rise so that British countries are now unable to obtain, for a given amount of dollar currency, the same quantity of goods as they could ( Mr obtain previously. NowI come down to the hard, cold facts. This is where one must be realistic. The United Kingdom Government has The great industrial used almost all of the American loan. An amount of 400,000,000 dollars was 'held in the pool when the convertibility -provision ceased to operate, and it remains frozen. That reserve may be released as the result of negotiations associated with the Marshall plan. I have had no omcial advice to that effect, but 1 am hopeful that it will be released. The British Government had about £600,000,000 sterling in gold reserves when the crisis occurred. It has had to draw extensively on those reserves. In addition, it has had to borrow from the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund. It has had to deprive its own people of vital goods, including the capital equipment that was mentioned hy the honourable member for Beid and the honourable member for New England in order that it might export those goods to earn dollars for the purchase of, not luxuries, but necessaries of life for the British people. It would not be pleasant for any government or any treasurer to be forced to impose restrictions upon the importation of goods which the people of Australia need. In many instances, goods which have heen banned are semi-essential, and others, though not luxuries, represent desirable commodities for the community. Anybody who thinks that a government or a treasurer would undertake a task such as that merely because of some caprice is very foolish. This Government tackled the job of restricting imports only with the utmost reluctance. I have mentioned the drain on British gold reserves. This Government has agreed to sell Australia's current gold output to the United Kingdom.. The gold will be sold for sterling and will represent a contribution to the United Kingdom's gold reserves. It is true that the Government of the United Kingdom requested that we should live within our dollar earnings, but that is an impossible task. T could talk for hours about the things mentioned by the honourable member for Bei' without covering all aspects 1 of them. For instance, I could discuss how we are sending certain goods to Great Britain so that the British people will not be forced to expend dollars in purchasing similar goods in other countries. That means that we are sending to the United Kingdom metals, other raw materials and foodstuffs which we could sell elsewhere. The wisdom of this policy ought to be appreciated. Last year, despite the restrictions that this Government had imposed, the net deficit in Australia's balance of payments with North America was about 100,000,000 dollars. This year, even though we have imposed further restrictions upon the use of dollars, we find that the situation is still rapidly deteriorating. Very reasonable supervision has been maintained over the issuing of import licenses for goods that involve dollar expenditure, but, owing to increased prices and other reasons, we are still importing far larger quantities of dollar goods than we could expect a country which is starved of dollars to sell to us. Those are the hard, cold facts. Despite all the talk by the honourable member for Beid and the honourable member for New England about restriction of imports from dollar areas, I cannot at this moment say whether even the suggested restrictions that will be considered by Cabinet on Monday will be sufficient to meet the demands of the situation. I noticed a statement in the British press last week in which a very high tribute was paid to the co-operation of the Australian Government in saving dollars. That statement declared that if other countries had done a? the United Kingdom and Australia had done the United Kingdom would by now have been much nearer than it is to the top of the very steep hill to complete economic rehabilitation which it is climbing. The Government has examined all of the suggestions that have been made to it to-night. We have spent many weary days on this task, but our efforts have been as nothing in comparison with those of the magnificent, staff of public servants associated with this work. They have been asked to perform a tremendous volume of work. .Sometimes public servants are condemned in this House, but the Minister.? who were associated with the Geneva trade negotiations for month after month did only one-twentieth of the work that was done by the public servants who assisted them. Our examination of dollar imports required only one-twentieth of the work that public servants had to do, working through week-ends and at night. The Government is discussing the problems associated with dollar shortages with tlie various industries affected in order that it may have the considered views of everybody on the subject. We are anxious to cushion the impact of restrictions so that industries may be kept operating as much as possible and so that people employed in them shall suffer as little as possible. It is easy to talk about disemploying persons engaged in the journalistic profession or in the printing trade, but such disemployment would mean tearing men away from the callings which they have selected for their lifetime vocations. It is very easy to say that jobs could be found elsewhere for these people. But to remove a man from his chosen profession or industry to another job involves disrupting his family life and taking him away from his accustomed' surroundings. There is no shortage of work in this country. There are not nearly enough people to do all the work required to be done. However, disemployment of some of us in this Parliament, for instance, would not help very much to expedite, I say, the laying of steel rails at Bourke, where men have to work in a temperature of 100 degrees. To tell the truth, I do not think that many of us would be much good at that job. I have tried to give, as accurately as is possible, information enable honourable members and those with whom they come in contact to appreciate the dollar situation. It is no good talking nonsense about this matter. purse with which to buy things, we must just ""knock off"" buying. That sums up the position. All of the suggestions made by the honourable member for New England and the honourable member for Reid regarding exports to dollar countries and to hard currency areas have been examined by the Government. Implementation of their suggestions in some instances would involve depriving our people of things which they badly need. For example, Australia could sell any given quantity of worsteds to other Mr Chifley. countries. However, Australians canuot obtain enough of these materials and, if the Government tried to earn dollars by selling them abroad, a great "" squeal"" would be raised. My final word in relation to this matter is that we must guard against the exhaustion of the British Empire dollar pool. Should the pool reach such a low ebb that dollars cannot be released to us, then we must sharply cut off imports of all things that we now hope to purchase with dollars. That would mean a sudden disruption of the national economy. We want to avoid doing that and to continue to do justice to our own people and to our great allies, the people of the United Kingdom.

I should like to add a word of appreciation of the members on my side of the House. We are an Opposition which is substantially outnumbered. However, 1 do not think that any honourable member could say that at any time after the last two elections, when we sustained heavy defeats, we exhibited any ill spirit. been a strenuous one: indeed, it has been We returned to this House, recognizing the will of the people, and we have had a difficult task to perform, because of legislation which has been introduced. ft o honourable gentleman who occupied r the position of Leader of the Opposition could have discharged his duties without the degree of co-operation and friendly assistance which I have received from those who sit behind me, and I want to make an acknowledgment to the members of my own party, and to the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Australian Country party, will continue Fadden) and his supporters, of the very friendly and helpful co-operation which T. have received from them. Without that co-operation I could not have carried on. Leader of the Australian Country party) [9.47] I desire to associate myself with the sentiments expressed so aptly by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr and the people of Australia and their Menzies). Notwithstanding all the pressure which has been brought to bear upon the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), inside and outside the House, he, like the Rock of Gibraltar, remains firm, and leads the Parliament and the Parliamentary Labour party. Nothing seems to move him, he still comes up and "" looks for more""; although I believe that he has underestimated the The existence of a good real feeling of the people of Australia relationship between the to-day. However, the time will come when the people will have an opportunity of expressing, in no uncertain manner, their opinion, through the ballot-box, which is the only constitutional means left to us. Nevertheless, I appreciate all that the right honourable gentleman has said. Obviously, the duty of honourable members on this side of the House is to oppose-and I trust that we oppose constructively-the measures which his Government brings down. cause the Government has always been wrong. However, I join with the Leader of the Opposition in his expressions of goodwill and good fellowship to members and supporters of the Government. The present sessional period has undoubtedly so trying that even friends have looked askance at one another and have disagreed. That, of course, was inevitable the mass of very important because of the nature of the measures introduced by the Government, measures which have reacted strongly on the minds of the people of Australia. The people realize that those measures are major ones, and the nature and magnitude of the Government's proposals have, unfortunately, divided the Australian people. Members of the Opposition, which includes both the Liberal party and the to exert the greatest possible vigilance, because we conscientiously believe that the measures which this Government has introduced are not in the best interests of Australia. I extend goodwill and seasonal greetings to you, Mr Speaker, and to the officers of the House. A democratic team cannot consist solely of "" spin bowlers "", representatives in this House must, in the nature of things, profess differing views. Indeed, that is one of the qualities which go to make up democracy.

Is the New Zealand Government offering farmers Ss. a bushel for wheat for 1047-48 and 1048-49 seasons? 2. Has the New Zealand Government been exporting flour made from Uie cheap Australian wheat at the overseas parity price? 3. Is there any provision in the AustraliaNew Zealand Wheat Agreement for a review? 4. If not, what steps can be taken to restore the Australian people's equity in the large annual supply of wheat to New Zealand? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Press reports indicate this is correct. 2. Some exports have been made by arrangement with the Australian Wheat Board, under which tlie board receives its current export price for destinations other than New Zealand for the wheat content of the quantity exported. 3. No. None is necessary. 4. An agreement has been made, and no further steps in regard to it are necessary. Commerce and A g r i c u l t u r e , u p o n notice1. Did Australia's delegate to the World Food Council ask for an assurance that grain withheld from livestock in Australia and exported abroad was being used for human consumption in the countries which received it? 2. Did Mr Bulcock say. further, that Australia could not continue to cut her own stock economy if wheat withheld from Australian livestock was used to feed stock in other parts of the world? 3. If so, did he make these statements with the approval of the Minister or of the Commonwealth Government? 4. Did Mr Bulcock receive the assurance asked for? 5. What action, if any, does the Government intend to take to ensure that wheat sent overseas is used solely for human consumption ? honourable member's questions are as follows:1, 2 and 3. The Australian representative on the Council of World Food and Agriculture Organization pointed out to the council that Australia was rationing wheat for stockfeeding, in order to make maximum amount* of wheat available for export to needy countries for human consumption, iu accordance with Government policy. The Australian representative also pointed out that Australia had made substantial cuts in wheat for stock-feeding, and asked that this be recognized by both importing and exporting countries. The question, however, is wider than the utilization of imported grain by needy countries, as owing to domestic difficulties of collection and distribution it may be possible to use home-grown grain for stock-feeding, and to use imported grain for human needs. 4. The council first considered the cereals problem as of immediate importance, and decided to urge all governments to implement economy measures, amongst which was the diversion of maximum amounts of cereals for human needs. A large-sqale grain-saving campaign is now in operation in the United States of America. 5. Australia is a member of the newly constituted International Food Emergency Council, which deals wit h the distribution of cereals, and every application for an import of cereals is examined very carefully to ensure that quantities allocated w ill be used for human feeding to the greatest possible extent. Involved in this examination is the question of domestic production which is related to the total requirements. This system does ensure, as far as possible, maximum use of grain for human consumption. Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, upon notice1.

In view of the importance of providing the people of outback areas with adequate air transport and of assisting the Flying Doctor Service in every way, will he have an immediate inquiry made, explain the reason for the alleged closures, and take appropriate steps to remedy the position? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. No; but, of course, any suggestion that the Commonwealth Government is desirous of or is doing anything towards killing the Flying Doctor Service is as far as is possible from the truth . 2. The site at McKinley, which has been leased in the past from the State of Queenslaud, is now being returned to that State. 3. No; but no action having this effect hag been or will be taken by my department. 4. It is the policy of the Government that the Commonwealth shall be responsible for the provision of airports at centres approved as regular stopping places on regularly operated airline routes and elsewhere as necessary for the safe operation of those services. It will, however, do what is within its power short of providing the funds to encourage the development of landing grounds by local authorities. McKinley is not an approved stopping place, neither is an emergency landing ground needed -there in connection with the regular airline route. McKinley is situated in a black soil .area and tlie gravel runways originally laid -down are of insufficient length to comply -with present standards for use by any aircraft iiow operating in Australia, but may be possible of extension by the Queensland Government. A considerable expenditure would be involved in the provision of adequate hardsurfaced runways and this cannot be justified from a Commonwealth viewpoint. The Premier of Queensland was informed in August that my department would be pleased to assist in an advisory capacity in the establishment of a suitable aerodrome there if either the State Government or local authority were to become interested in such a project.

In addition, South Africa w ill continue to sell gold to the Bank of England equivalent in amount to the net uon-sterliug obligations incurred by South Africa. Thus South Africa uot only meets nil her own current expenditure in the non-sterling area by providing gold to an equivalent value, but, in addition, has made a substantial loan of gold to assist in meeting the immediate dollar difficulties of the other members of the British Commonwealth. In these circumstances, South Africa has not felt it necessary to restrict her dollar imports and, in fact, has removed quantitative control of imports from all sources. A i r , u p o n notice 1.
