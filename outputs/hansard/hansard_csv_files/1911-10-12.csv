Mr VV. ELLIOT JOHNSON -Refer ring to the answer given by the Minister of Home Affairs to the question put to him hy the honourable member for Capricornia, I desire to ask the honourable gentleman .whether he expects to receive any designs from experts in other parts of the world, in view of their expressed determination to refrain from submitting any under the terms and conditions of the competition? In any case, will the Minister say what purpose will be served by delaying the appointment of a Board of adjudication? Will he not take into consideration the adfor External Affairs, when he is appointed, visableness of reassuring those who have been invited to compete as to the competency and absolute impartiality of the Board that is to be appointed ? emphasize the point that town planning is principally the work, not of architects, but noticeof engineers and surveyors. The work of the architect in that connection is superficial. When we call for designs for buildings at the Federal Capital, the work of the architect will come into play, but it would be preposterous to talk of postponing this matter at the present stage. I desire to build the Capital, but apparently the honourable member does not. do not wish to postpone the work. fact that Mr Howard has been conspicuously successful in the work of laying out garden cities in England, will the Minister of Home Affairs consider the desirableness of inviting him to assist in the work of laying out the Federal Capital? may be considered a little later on; but we are not yet ready to take action in regard to it. planation, may I state that when I asked the Minister of Home Affairs a certain question a few moments ago, I had no desire to suggest that Tammany Hall methods, whatever they may be, should be introduced into Australian politics. I do not pretend to know exactly what they are. I wish, however, to ask the Minister whether he himself is going to undertake the work of adjudicating upon any designs that are submitted? There seems to be an impression on the part of architects that the Minister is going to take upon himself that judicial duty. going to be the artistic judge. The three gentlemen whom I intend to appoint will judge the designs, and the decision of the Government will be final.

Engineer-Captain Clarkson was sent abroad to supervise the arrangements for the supply of machinery and tools for the Small Arms Factory, and it was proposed by Sir Thomas Ewing (the then Minister of Defence) that, when the time came for the appointment of a manager to the factory, Engineer-Captain Clarkson should be appointed if considered competent to undertake its management. EngineerCaptain Clarkson subsequently stated he would prefer to retain his connection with the Naval Forces. On the reconstitution of the Naval Board on the lines recommended by Admiral Henderson, the position of third naval member was created, and it was offered by Senator Pearce to Engineer-Captain Clarkson, who has since been appointed to the position in question.

I holding out hope to us? I have heard any position, having my own mind and ideas to guide me. At any rate, the Opposition cannot hope to convert their minority into a majority in this House, He though, of course, they may have an opportunity elsewhere sooner or later. 1'he honourable member for Parramatta was quite in error when he spoke of my having introduced a late Budget on a previous occasion. That was done by a predecessor of mine; and the illustration rather tells in Never has the Budget been demy favour than against me, because the The only precircumstances of 1908 were very similar to those of this year. We then had the visit of the American Fleet, which we were all pleased to welcome; and, though all the Ministers were in the Commonwealth, there was a difficulty in bringing forward the Budget until the middle of October. I may say that I have not spared myself, in the public interest, in my efforts to get the Budget on I was not then in office. earlier.

106,Mr Kelly,"It is the duty of a Minget at the flesh-pots. Although we may be willing to grant two months' Supply to the present Treasurer, we do not know who will hold that office two months hence. It might be the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and it might be a gentleman who, with befitting modesty, has taken himself away from these precincts during this time of crisis, the honourable member for Gwydir. We are entitled to know who the new Ministers are to be before taking a leap in the daik. I see on the Government benches faces alive with expectation and anticipation. Indeed, I regret that we cannot have a Ministry unlimited in regard to numbers, so that the whole party could hold office. It is ridiculous to keep on askfuture Treasurers. He used always to ing us to vote Supply before the introduction of the Estimates, because we do not know what the money is needed for. No matter what Government is in power, the interests of the country should be studied before the convenience of Ministers or the advantages of party. It is unfortunate that five months' Supply should have to be granted before the Treasurer makes his statement regarding the finances of the country, but that must happen if we pass this Bill. The right honourable gentleman has promised to introduce the Estimates next 3>ear in July, but unless he changes the currency of the financial year, that will not be possible, if honourable members are to be provided with the information which it has been the practice to give to them. If the financial year ended on the 31st March, there would be no reason why the Budget should not be presented at the beginning of July. for that date. month is required to close the public accounts of the year, and allot each item of expenditure to its proper column. I tried, when Treasurer, to introduce the Budget early, and found it impossible to make a financial statement within six weeks after the termination of the financial year. The real reason, I should say, why the Budget has been delayed this year is that the Treasurer was unavoidably absent in England attending the Coronation. sence and the illness of other Ministers. delay, which, perhaps, has been longer than was necessary. The accounts of last year must have been ready for the Treasurer on his return, so that he had only to concern himself with the current year. I know what he used to say to me about the introduction of the Budget. honourable member kindly. honourable gentleman was very ungenerous when in Opposition, out I do not propose to retaliate, because I know the difficulties of his position, and think it my duty to assist rather than to obstruct him. No doubt, when the swing of the pendulum returns him to this side, his experience of office will make him more generous to object to Supply Bills for more than one month. Personally, I do not think it matters much in this case whether a Supply is asked for one or two months, because we shall have the Estimates on the table long before two months have expired, but I think only a month's Supply should have been asked for. The Estimates will be here within a fortnight. Supply will save another Supply Bill. honourable gentleman may find it necessary to pass one or two more this session. are not likely to be passed within the next two months. since two months hence we shall be in December. surer will probably find it necessary to introduce another Supply Bill before the Estimates are dealt with, although I trust that he will not have to do so. I rose really to assist rather than to oppose the right honourable gentleman. As long as our financial year ends on 30th June so long must it be difficult, if not impossible, to present the Estimates to the House before the middle of August. The earliest date at which I was able, as Treasurer, to submit them was 12th August, and I found it very difficult to have everything in readiness for their presentation within that time. Supply has to be obtained, and the Works Estimates have to be passed, before the general Estimates can be dealt with, and the difficulty of the position is largely due to the fact that Parliament generally opens just as the financial year closes, whereas, when the British Parliament meets",20,Elliot Johnson Wher E Is Accommodation North Sydney

119,Sir John Forrest,"The Treathe Estimates are always ready for presentation. The Treasurer of the Commonwealth has to wait at least a month after the close of the financial year to secure the exact figures as to the expenditure during that period, so that he finds himself in a difficult position in endeavouring to place the Estimates before the House earlier than about the middle of August. [3.28] I am very dissatisfied with the Treasurer's explanation, and must certainly congratulate the right honourable member for Swan on the Christian spirit he has displayed in this connection. When he held office as Treasurer he was never treated as he is treating the Leader of the Government to-day. I quite agree that some time must necessarily elapse between the closing of the financial year and the presentation of the Budget. The position, however, since the new financial arrangement was entered into with the States, is not nearly so difficult as it was. If , under the old system, I have nothing further to communicate reit was possible to submit the Estimates to the House within six weeks of the close of the financial year, there can be no justiof last year's Estimates.

It ought not to have taken the right honourable gentleman more than a fortnight after his return to prepare the Budget. I do not pretend to know what the Government are doing, but I strongly protest against the House losing its control of the finances.

As a matter of fact, tbere are seven or eight. new policy. When a request is made for Supply the fullest particulars are expected. Although the amount of an item may be small, the passing of the item itself may establish a rathei important principle or precedent. For instance, I find on page 14 of the Bill, uncier the heading of "" Defence,"" an entirely new item, "" Special School of Instruction, Â£1.000,"" whilst we have also an item of Â£1,500 in respect of "" Signal Stations ancl Examination Services."" Those items do not appear in the previous Bill. By agreeing to the schedule as it stands we shall be authorizing the establishment of signal stations and examination services, as well as a special school of instruction under the Defence Department, as to whicli no proposals have been submitted to us, although no doubt they have been generally indicated as part of the defence scheme..

I take it I am informed, and believe at present, that no vote has been taken ""hitherto for either "" special school of instruction "" or "" signal stations and examination services"" under the Department of Defence, in the connection in which they are now being applied. The question of amount' does not enter into the argument. If these items are new, attention should certainly be directed to them. I feel quite satisfied that the proposals are necessary and legitimate, but at the same time if Parliament authorizes them, it must know that it is doing so, and not be accepting them without understanding for what objects it is voting the money. I notice in the vote for the Northern Territory an item of .Â£2,500 for gold-fields and mining contingencies; another of .Â£3,000 for works and buildings; and another of Â£55,000 for interest and sinking fund; the total expenditure on the Northern Territory being Â£70,888.

138,Mr Fisher (Wide Bay,"Prime Minby the Leader of the Opposition, when Prime Minister, and the late Mr Thomas Price, then Premier of South Australia, this Parliament took over possession and control of the Northern Territory, and took the responsibility for the losses and liabilities on the working of the Territory. This included about Â£4,000,000 of debt, the interest of which is a serious annual loss on the Territory, and the loss on the -Oodnadatta raihvay. We provide monthly in these Supply Bills to meet that loss. My recollection is that all the previous deficits on the administration of the Territory were funded to loan expenditure by the State, and that whether the Commonwealth took the Territory over soon or late, that burden would still have to be borne. During the last financial year, the Commonwealth met a considerable amount of the debt, amounting to about Â£400,000, out of revenue, but we shall not be able to go on doing that. Speaking from memory, I believe the Oodnadatta railway just about pays working expenses. .Â£12,000, and Â£12,000 during the last three recorded years. agreement entered into by my late colleague it has only paid expenses.

The New South Wales Parliament and people have not yet been heard upon that question. vernment are so impressed with the necessity for a big and bold immigration scheme that they propose to devote Â£60,000 to it this year, as incidental to what they hope will be a large and important Federal undertaking. It is time we heard from the Prime Minister what the Federal Government intend to do about this subject. There is no more pressing question in the whole political domain; it is the one outstanding question which far transcends any other in importance, and presses for a speedy settlement. While the Government are doling out this small amount, much more is being done in the States; and the sooner the Prime Minister gets in front of this movement, as he is now invited to do by his confreres in the largest of the States, the better for Australia. nexion, I should like to call attention to that very pretty picture which is exhibited in the Queen's Hall, and in the preparation and distribution of which, I understand, some Â£2,000 or Â£3,000 has been spent. I have not a word to say as to the quality of the picture, which appears excellent in every way; but I do not think it is worth the money as an advertising agency for peopling Australia. The money could be spent in a very much more practical way than distributing pictures of this kind throughout the Old Country. If we desired people there to know what a fine climate we have, and what pretty wattle we grow, this picture will do; but what those on the other side of the world desire to learn is what our resources are, and what their chances and prospects are here. I do not think, for instance, that the publication of the picture would induce a fruit-grower to come here. Perhaps the Prime Minister does not know that fruit growers have no great liking for the wattle in the vicinity of their orchards, which is very destructive, so far as orchards are concerned; and I doubt the wisdom of publishing broadcast a picture .of the kind. I should not call attention to the matter were the question not of such importance, immigration so small. The Prime Minister should let the House and the country know what he proposes to do in this pressing matter. We have a distinct intimation from himself, that if the Prime Minister will only be bold, and bring in his project, he will have the undivided and unqualified support of his confreres in that State.

McGowen is doing; but if he is spending a lot of money in advertising New South Wales he is, in my opinion, pursuing a wrong policy. We need not spend another penny in advertising, and yet we shall have any number of people coming here for many years. What we have to do is to set our own house in order; there is plenty to do in the way of reforms in Australia to make the condition of thousands of people here happier, without bringing in a lot of immigrants with the effect of lowering wages in many cases, and in making it much harder for the Labour party to realize the ideals which they have set up. I admit that when we go abroad and-in London and elsewhere-se e the great number of people who are unable to make a living, we feel that we would like to give them a chance here; and the view I am expressing may appear a selfish one. But I do not think we should improve the lot of those people if we made it impossible for us to carry out Labour ideals in Australia by assisting them to come here to cut down wages. Every nation, and every section of the Empire, has to look after its own poor, and to so govern itself that there will standing.

I do not believe that it is necessary to spend money in advertising, because Australia has received a very good advertisement already by the money spent in connection with certain events.

The family is one of culture and refinement, which has met with adversity, and assistance from this fund would be acceptable to it. The application has been dealt with harshly. In reply to a letter asking for consideration, supported by a number of reputable citizens of New Soutli Wales, the Secretary to tlie Department of External Affairs wrote to Miss Stenhouse on the 31st March as followsWith reference to your application for assistthe charges for the Inter-State transmission of ance from the Commonwealth Literary Fund, I have the honour to inform you that the matter has been considered by the* Central Committee appointed to deal with such claims. It is regretted, however, that they could not see their way to make any recommendation to the Ministei;, as your late father, though closely connected with the early literature of New South Wales, was not himself engaged in literary work to any great extent. The accuracy of the concluding statement is stoutly denied by those who knew Mr has now been spent, less than a dozen, newsStenhouse well, and even if it were strictly true, the intention of Parliament, I believe, was that grants from the fund should not be confined actually to persons solely engaged in literary work, or their relatives, but should go also to those closely associated with literature by collecting and preserving books and records of literary value, and also in other ways have been personally identified with literature. Mr Stenhouse rendered signal service to literature, and the claims of his family should have received more favorable consideration.

The honourable member for Capricornia seems to think, in connection with the immigration policy, that it is a great mistake to spend any money to advertise the resources of Australia. I suppose he, in common with others, holds the idea that if we encourage people to come here, there will be more competitors for the bread and butter available. That is an exploded economic fallacy. The more people we bring here, and employ profitably tion 1 Mr VV. ELLIOT JOHNSON I do not say that we should bring all the wastrels and unemployables to this country. The honourable member made no such distinction. He was against the whole business of immigration, lock, stock, and barrel. He said we had plenty to do to set our own house in order, and to provide for those already here. That statement is quite contrary to ascertained facts, as dispictures of some of our rural industries, closed by the report of Mr Piddington, the Royal Commissioner, who estimates that in Sydney alone there is a shortage of upwards of 3,000 skilled workers. If we carry his argument to its logical conclusion, the fewer people we have in Australia, the more there will be to go round amongst ' those who remain. If , therefore, we could reduce the present population to 10,000 people, the obvious conclusion, according to the honourable member, would be that the money now spent among 4,000,000 people would be divided amongst 10,000, and if we could reduce our population to a hundred, they would all be millionaires. . matter of fact, quite (he reverse would happen. If we can only induce the right kind of people to come here, and give them profitable employment, particularly in our great primary industries, opening up the vast resources of this country, we should do good in many ways. We should be providing for employment for a still larger number of people than we can now provide for, because every new arrival would give work to at least a hundred other people to supply the extra population would be the obtaining of more revenue. Our trade and commerce and industry would increase acline of defence would all the time continue to be strengthened. We should, therefore, not discourage expenditure on advertising, but encourage it still further. We should make the resources of Australia known, not only in the Old Country, but in other lands, particularly in those Scandinavian countries, from which I hope we may be able to attract a good rural population.. but white people, and if we cannot get people of British extraction, we must be prepared to take foreigners. I prefer those of the virile Scandinavian races to. those of the more effete and less suitable nations of southern Europe. member think that we can find a better advertisement in England than a poster showing a pretty woman amongst wattle blossoms? doubtedly. While I admire the picture exhibited in the Queen's Hall, I do not think it is quite suitable for the purpose for which it is intended. We should obtain not exaggerated, but true and faithful representations of things actually going on in Australia. These would give a fair and definite idea to the people of the Old Country, and elsewhere, as to what our actual resources are, and the type of immigrants that we desire to obtain. We ought to spend a great deal more than at present on immigration, so as to bring more people of the right stamp here. If we are to hold this country, we must fill our vast empty spaces, more particularly those areas adjacent to the coastline, and most capable of affording an adequate return for the labour expended on the land. Our As a surest line of defence against aggression is the peopling of our coastal areas to a distance of, at least, 30 or 40 miles inland.

The question of increasing our population as rapidly as possible, not only by natural means, but.by assisted immigration, is of the utmost importance. say that I am opposed to immigration as such, but it seems ridiculous to spend ^3,000 on a poster such as that exhibited in the Queen's Hall. I doubt it. not yet met any one who objects to a pretty girl surrounded by pretty flowers, but that. Â£3,000 could have been put to much better use. For instance, why not exhibit the picture of a dairymaid going out at 4 o'clock in the morning to milk the cows ? That would be a much more truthful representation of Australian life. Some of the money might well have been spent in circulating photographic reproductions of the iron works, copper-smeLting works, coal mines, ind dairying and pastoral industries of the Commonwealth, so as to give a true representation of the life of Australia as we know it. That sum of Â£3,000 has been practically wasted, .because the picture IK question will mislead a number of girls in the Old Country to think, that if fhey come to Australia they will need to do nothing but dress nicely and spend their time picking wattle blossom. That sort of thing will do an incalculable amount of harm to Australia, and move practical means of advertising our resources sbould be adopted. What is needed is to make the true facts about Australia better known, and to organize the Immigration Department in such a way tliat people will be brought out in. the trades where there are openings for them. At present each State is doing a little bit of advertising on resumed ? its own account, and the Commonwealth is doing a little, with the result that in many trades where there are already sufficient employees more ave being, brought out and overstocking the market. That kind of thing could be rectified by the States and the Commonwealth conferring, and adopting a common-sense system of organization."" Tlie business will have to lie organized like every other business. I believe there is any amount of room"" for a sensible organization of the immigration proposals in connection with our great country. In connection with defence. I have a very hardy annual in my electorate known as the Liverpool manoeuvre area. Notice of resumption was served on the tenants as long ago as 1907, and the private holders there are placed in a very invidious position. They can get no satisfaction as to what is to be done; If one goes to the State Government, he is referred to the Commonwealth.. If he goes to the Commonwealth he is referred back to the State. The question has been agitated for a long time in my electorate, because I notice that my predecessor was just as much troubled over it as I am. It seems peculiar that in this particular case the Commonwealth Government should make the State the means through which, they resume the area. I understand the Commonwealth Government have direct power toresume land for defence purposes, but in. this instance they seem to have adopted the method of allowing the State to resume the land, the Commonwealth paying the interest on the cost of resumption. The transaction seemed on a fair way towards completion until the middle of this year, when it was mixed up with the question of the transferred properties. The Honorary Minister in the New South, Wales Government informed me that,, until fhe question of the transferred properties is settled, nothing can fie done in regard to tlie Liverpool manoeuvre area. Do the Commonwealth Government intend to allow this matter to remain at the present unsatisfactory stage? The private owners of land ought to be given some satisfaction one way or the other. If the bulk of the land is Crown land, I do not care, nor do I think the private owners care, how long, the Stateand Commonwealth Governments carry on their negotiations. member think that the land ought to be the private owners ought to be notified as. to tlie Government's intention. According to the newspapers, an understanding has been, arrived'ai between the State Premiersand the Commonwealth Government in regard to the payment of the interest on> transferred properties; and if that question is out of the way, there ought to be some definite conclusion in regard to this area.

By an administrative Act the Government issued instructions that, so far as the Tostal Department was concerned, widows and children should be compensated ; but, as a matter of fact, there are more dependents than widows and children. think, the honourable member for Eden Monaro, when Postmaster-General, who issued the order that the principles of the Workmen's Compensation Act should be applied as far as possible. But cases have to be reported, settled by the Department, and provided for on the Estimates before those entitled are ultimately paid. There ought to be some definite system by which the Commonwealth, in the case of men directly employed by it, shall pay compensation, at any rate equal to that paid by private employers. There ought to be some cheap method of quickly deciding the responsibility, and provision made for dependents to receive almost immediate relief. cial cases. would be much better to have a definite system under which this compensation should be paid as a right, and not have to be applied for, it may be, through a parliamentary representative, or some other person. ber say whether we have the necessary power ? doubtedly, we have the constitutional power to give compensation to our own workmen. thing of that kind, remembering the Seamen's Compensation Act. we still have definite and decided power.

At any rate, there is no doubt that we can give compensation in the case of our own servants if an accident occurs within a State. I should also like to call attention to the working of the Meteorological Department, in regard to which I am strongly of opinion we have not yet done our duty. Mr Hunt reported that many of his efforts to improve the usefulness of the service were impeded by obstacles raised by other Departments. partments ! Every Department would take the whole of the revenue if it had a chance ! Minister has some sympathy for the vast army of settlers, producers, and pastoralists all over Australia. In New South Wales there is a full distribution of reports of the actual rainfall, and that is a good and right system, which ought not to be confined to that State. not distribute the news? Wales is distributed by Commonwealth agencies at Commonwealth expense, whereas in Queensland, whose needs in this respect are exactly the same, there is no distribution at all. plies the information, and the States should distribute it. quite wrong. In the first place, it is a Commonwealth instrument-in the shape of the telegraph-that is employed in the distribution of the .news. The whole burden of the meteorological work, which includes the dissemination of such news, is a national obligation, ancl placed on the Commonwealth by the Constitution. ber have the news put into every man's cloor every morning? The American telephone companies vie with one another in offering concessions lo probable subscribers, and one of the concessions offered by most, if not all of the companies, is tlie free calling of subscribers every day to give them the daily forecasts.",31,Elliot Johnson Wher E Is Accommodation North Sydney

235,Tract From A Report By Mr Hunt,"I do not advocate that that should be done, and merely read the quotation to show the breadth of the sympathy which is extended to the Bureau in the United States of AmericaI n the year 1907, no less than 1,985,905 subscribers received the daily forecasts by this method alone. The suggestion might be submitted to the Postal authorities in Australia for consideration as a means to induce squatters and settlers in the interior to become subscribers to the telephone system. The prime producers are the chief individuals in the Australian community interested in the weather prospects, and while means of advising them at the earliest possible moment of the probable weather remains inadequate, tbe efforts of this Department and the Government's intentions for creating the weather service are negatived in their chief object; at the same time, in remote districts, squatters and farmers remain at a serious disadvantage, as compared with settlers near towns, where the forecasts are posted or disseminated by the newspapers, and are almost entirely at the mercy of unscrupulous _ dealers in their products, resident in the cities and towns, where weather advices are readily accessible. However, postal regulations have recently been framed whereby the distribution of forecasts and flood warnings by telegraph and telephone has been greatly facilitated ; further, it is incumbent upon Postal officials to report any unusual meteorological occurrences or phenomena. I should like here to express the indebtedness of this Department since its inauguration for the invaluable assistance and co-operation accorded it by the Central Postal Administration, and it is hoped that it may at thc earliest possible date furnish us with long deferred desired data from Queensland, the lack of which is discounting not only our efforts to improve tlie accuracy of the forecasts for that State, but for the whole of the Commonwealth. As has already been pointed out, this branch of our work must stagnate until these necessary data are forthcoming. I quite agree with the Prime Minister that a firm hand should be kept on the expenditure of the Department. If he were to grant every concession asked for, his hands would be pretty full. But the Meteorological Department was established to forecast the weather for Australia, and if its work is to be of value it must be supplied with the necessary data. plains that he does not get sufficient data. Surely it would not cost very much to supply him with the information he needs. would only mean the greater use of our system of telegraphs, which spread all over the Commonwealth. In this connection I ask why, since New South Wales can have information regarding rainfall made public all over the State, that cannot be done by South Australia and Queensland? It has been pointed out to me on several occasions Mr Groom. by those interested in the travelling of stock that it would be of great advantage to them to be informed of the weather in the districts through which they are travelling. Such information might reasonably be published at places of importance, being posted daily at the telegraph offices. That would not throw a heavy burden on the Telegraph Department, and would greatly assist persons in the distant interior. In Tasmania advice regarding the weather has prevented the spoiling of crops, and information as to weather conditions is of the greatest value to all connected with rural pursuits. Australia must not lag behind in this matter. In England, India, the United States, and Europe, the closest scientific investigation is being given to weather conditions, ancl we should have a Department of original research, and make our contribution to the knowledge of the world. The time will come when we shall be in yet closer touch with the weather Departments of other countries than we are now. I hope that the Prime Minister will give favorable consideration to my suggestions. the suggestions, but there is a limit to the sum available for the transmitting of information regarding the weather. spending of more money.

I was sorry to hear the expression of the opinion of the honourable member for Capricornia regarding immigration. If any part of Australia needs immigrants it is Queensland. The Royal Commissioner appointed in New South Wales' to investigate the matter declared that, instead of immigration having tended to reduce wages, the inflow of population had increased employment. Those who have come here are doing useful work, and the supplying of their needs gives occupation to others. as they get here. to do that. identifies himself with Australian institutions, the better for him and for the country. grants have got into this Parliament. them here, because Australia would be the poorer without their service.

That, I am satisfied, would be a good thing. suitable offices for the High Commissioner and the Agents-General. accommodation is one of the first steps to take. Nothing is to be gained by forcing matters, but the co-operation suggested will self of an early opportunity to institute a be in the best interests of Australia, beproper method of medical inspection at cause it will prevent a conflict of effort, the port of departure.

Farm labourers and others who come to Queensland find work at once, proving themselves, in many instances, exceedingly satisfactory workers. I hope that the Government will propose a liberal vote for advertising, and will give the High Commissioner a free hand in the spending of it. The advertisement should be of the nature suggested when he was first appointed, care being taken that no statement is published which is not absolutely true. It is better to understate than to overstate the case. I agree with the honourable member for Nepean that the truth about Australia is good enough, and that the picture does not need its attractiveness heightened by false colours. of Canada. with what Canada may do. I hope for a' forward movement, so that Australia may grow in strength and vigour by the inflow of useful immigrants. I am of the opinion that we must do all we can to fill the vast vacant spaces of Australia, and agree with the honourable member for Darling Downs that the immigrants should be of the right class. It is useless for men who belong to trades which are already overmanned to come here. Only this afternoon I got a letter from a man who says that he has been out of employment for six weeks. He is an Englishman, but following an occupation The sooner an immigrant in which there are not many openings. here for some time. I suggest the advisableness of the medical examination of intending immigrants in London. Nothing of the kind is insisted on now, and the steamer by which I recently travelled from Europe brought two immigrants who were not allowed to land at any of the ports because they could not pass the medical examination. A previous vessel, I was informed, brought an immigrant who was suffering from consumption. He was refused admission, and told that he must return to England, but he juii.^ed overboard between Fremantle and Adelaide.

256,Mr Laird Smith,"No; he has beenand should undergo a strict medical examination before they are allowed to depart from Great Britain. I noticed while at -Home that our High Commissioner, with the limited funds at his disposal, was doing much in Great Britain to advertise Australia. It was my privilege to attend one of the finest agricultural shows held in England-that of the Norwich Agricultural Society-and there I saw a Commonwealth exhibit under the supervision of a young man who, I understand, was at one time on the Australian press. I found that, like all pressmen, he was very well informed as to the country from which he came. stood amongst those listening to what he had to say of Australia, and he displayed a knowledge of his subject that was exceedingly refreshing. He also encouraged an Australian fanner who was on a visit to the Old Country to say a few words to the people who surrounded the exhibit, and it was delightful to hear that man give his experiences of Australia. He did not refrain from telling his audience the actual facts of his position. Whilst he was speaking some one interjected, "" Is there not a Labour party in power in Australia?"" His reply was that there might be, but that that fact had not interfered with the prosperity of the farmer here. I found in various parts of Great Britain men who had made their money on the land in Australia, and who did not hesitate to tell the people how well off were the farmers of the Commonwealth. The Norwich Show proved one of tbe best advertisements that Australia could have. I found that New South Wales was also advertising freely in the Old Country, and that its representatives were able to say that farmers would find it easy, on arriving in Australia, to obtain land. That is the sort of advertisement that we need. We ought to be able to assure the people of Great Britain that those who come here with the object of settling on the land will be able to secure blocks without difficulty. New South Wales in this respect has set the other States of the Commonwealth an excellent example. system, and is making provision, by new railways and other means, for opening up her Crown lands. The Government have also resumed large estates, so as to be able to settle people on the land when they arrive here. power to-day are not doing that. They are me whilst I was there, "" I notice giving up the work. Mr Laird Smith. confidence in the present Government of New South Wales. They are practical men, and are quite capable of doing all that is necessary to settle the people on the land. Some of them have risen from the ranks; they know what it is to be out of work, and how necessary it is to provide employment for the workers when tney land here. I had no hesitation in telling people of the right class whom I met in the Old Country that they would find Australia the greatest country on God's earth. In my humble opinion, there is no greater country. NoI country offers greater opportunities for the man with capital or the man desirous of settling on the land and making a home for himself. I do not agree with the honourable member for Nepean as to the picture of the lady and the wattle blossom. The Government, to my mind, have adopted a wise means of advertising Australia by calling to their aid the wattle blossom. Canada advertises largely by means of a botanic emblem known as the maple leaf. Whereever we went in Great Britain, we heard the people speak of "" Canada and the maple leaf,"" and whenever the Canadians were asked to sing they usually said, "" We do not sing individually, but we are prepared to join in singing our National Anthem, 'The Maple Leaf.'"" I could not help thinking at the time that if we Australians had sung an Australian National Anthem in preference to the National Anthem of the Empire cablegrams would have been sent at once to Australia telling of the terrible disloyalty of the Labour party. The Canadians, however, were able to do this without any exception being taken to their action. At the Dominion gathering, nt which some 1,800 persons were assembled, they sang the National Anthem of the maple leaf even before the National Anthem of the Empire was rendered, and I must confess that the patriotism of those people-thei r love for the country that had served them so well-strongl y appealed to me. If we wish to advertise this country as it Shehas a splendid irrigation should be advertised we must become more truly Australian, and have done for all time with petty parochial State Rights considerations. We never heard the Canadians speak of Quebec, Ontario, or any individual province. Witb them it was ""Canada"" every time. They taught us in this respect, an excellent lesson, which we did not hesitate to turn to account. A Tasmanian that you always announce yourself,",34,Elliot Johnson Wher E Is Accommodation North Sydney

258,Mr Laird Smith,"I have everynot as a Tasmanian, but as an Australian."" I replied, "" In this connection 1 -do not know Tasmania. I know only the great Commonwealth of Australia, to which I am proud to belong."" If we desire to attract people to our vacant spaces we must deal with the Commonwealth as Australia, and as Australia only. That is one reason why I hope we shall have very shortly in London a Commonwealth office, in which not only the High Commissioner, but the Agents-General of the States will be housed. know where to go to learn of the advantages to be obtained by settling in Australia. I hope that we shall not confine our advertising to Great Britain. It would be well for us to advertise in Switzerland and other parts of the Continent which I visited, and where I and other members of the delegation saw people working under terrible conditions. working small plots of land that would not be looked at in Australia. Land equal to our third-class country would be readily worked in Switzerland, and a great deal would be thought of it. Swiss to come out here, I am sure that we should find them excellent citizens. Again, why should we not advertise in the United States of America, and also in Canada? We should do everything possible to induce -white people to come here. I do not cave to what nationality they belong, provided that they become good healthy settlers, for I realize that that country is the wealthiest which nourishes the greatest number of happy and healthy individuals. beginning to smell a mystery in connection with the wattle bush bf which we have heard so much. We"" have had member after membeT from the other side referring to the picture of the mysterious lady of the wattle bush, and all vehemently trying to dissociate themselves from the suspicion of being connected in any way with her. sion, she is a carefully brought up although rather over-nourished representative of Australian femininity; but why these honourable members should be so anxious to dissociate themselves from the young lady I do not know. I should have expected to find them only too anxious to prove that their taste was good, and their -record equally so. I do not wish for a moment to f a l l into the mistake of imagining that anything that may be said here on the subiect of immigration will do very much good in the Chamber itself; but I am satisfied that, so far as the House has opportunities of transferring itself, through the medium of Hansard, into the constituencies, anything we may do to formulate a healthy public opinion must be of value. There is one credit I shall always do my honourable friends opposite, and that is that they will ever be ready and willing to exploit any public sentiment, however opVisitors to London will then posed they may have been to it, the moment it becomes politically valuable and advantageous to them. I do not say this in any offensive spirit; indeed, I am rather anxious to conciliate them. cannot class me amongst the number in * this respect, because I am opposing the proposition. It is popular, but I think it In Switzerland we saw men wrong. cion of the reason of the honourable member's opposition to it . Take, for instance, the views of the honourable member for Nepean, who thinks that this lady of the If we could induce some of the wattle blossom might lure into Australia a number of romantically inclined joung men who might seriously disturb even the placid calm of die honourable member for Capricornia. The mere sight of this lady and the wattle blossom has put my honourable friend in a state of almost bilious indignation. I appeal to him, however, not to be over hasty in dealing with the .subject. The honourable member for Denison, who has studied this question on the other side of the world, will agree with me that we are at a very serious disadvantage in competing with Canada for immigrants, inasmuch as it is not so much the Canadian Government that attracts immigrants as it is the agents of the great land-grant railway companies. > Company. panies, which are all working in with the system. thoughts are still running on the name of the lady.

The State must organize, as Canada has done through the agency of the Canadian-Pacific Railway and other land-grant railway companies. I do not wish to labour this question, further ment. That is a bad precedent to estabthan to say that we shall have to try to copy the operations of the Canadian Pacific Railway in providing for immigrants, almost down to the housing of them, so that as soon as they arrive they can be put in the way of making a living for themselves. There are one or two other matters to which I desire to refer. During the next two months, in respect of which we are asked to vote Supplies, the Government will be free to take action with regard to various matters, and we ought to be informed now of what they are going to do with respect to trusts and combines. We were assured, during this session, that the Government proposed to institute a judicial inquiry into the sugar industry. I thought that would mean an inquiry by persons not identified with either side of politics. them. to get men sufficiently divorced from polibacco industry of Australia. tics to be able to satisfy the public mind Tobacco Trust was not to be sacred. that those who are to sit in judgment upon a question which is, after all, largely political, have not either supported monetarily a party organization, or honourable friends opposite seem to be stood as the pledged candidates of afraid, for some reason or other, to go on either political party.

I understand that the Royal Commission recently appointed is composed, outside the Chairman, largely of persons interested in our party warfare.

Such concerns will, generally speaking, welcome any fair inquiry into their working, because it will be shown that a vast proportion of the attacks made upon them have been ill-founded, and made for party political purposes, not always by honourable members opposite, but by persons supporting them, or even by persons supporting this side of the House. If , however, the Government are going to inquire, let them inquire all round, and let the inquiry be really judicial.

I hope he will be able to cause something to be done in that connection; but I cannot understand why he should have overlooked the question of the small arms factory. That is the most extraordinary thing we have ever had in Commonwealth administration, with, perhaps, the exception of that wireless contract which has been the occasion for the display of so much business innocence on the part of the Postal Department. The small arms factory brings up a very curious problem. Some years ago, when we deWe see what they cided to manufacture small arms for ourselves, we sent a good Australian, in Commander Clarkson, to England to find out all about small arms. He was a very excellent engineer officer in the local Naval Forces, but he did not know, or pretend to know, anything about rifles. He was, however, sent Home at the expense of Australia to be educated in rifles, and with a view to coming back and making his knowledge generally useful to the Australian people. time ago, and the factory is not yet working. Commander Clarkson spent a considerable time abroad. He learned a good deal about the subject, and when he came back he found things in a fair state of tangle. He Avas then asked whether he wanted to go to the small arms factory; but, like a wise man, he said he would rather take up the business of authority upon naval construction on the Naval Board. at the Commonwealth expense he returns and takes up that other position on the Naval Board. If we have a right to educate our public servants, and send them to the other side of the world, we have a right to use them in the jobs for which we have educated them. This officer, however, has gone into a job about which he knows no more than he once knew about rifles. I am not attacking him, but the system. He is an excellent engineer officer, and an authority in the engine-room of a ship. He was asked suddenly to become an authority on the construction of rifles. He struggled for two years with that subject, and learned something about it, and then, after having paid for the cost of his instruction in that subject, the Government transfer him to a new Department, about which he knows absolutely nothing.

325,Mr Deakin,"Was he not considered?The appointment was a back-door one. No one knows why Mr Petersen was appointed, and no one knew that he was to be appointed until the notice appeared in the Gazette. Mr Close was naturally incensed by the way in which he was treated, especially as he knew that his credentials were as good as those of Mr Petersen. He stated his case in the following letter: I note that you take exception in youi ""Notes"" of 27th instant to portion of my objecjections, published in the "" He r a l d "" of that date, relating to the recent Federal appointment of a director of physical training. I think there is to be fojind ample proof that the principle of "" Australia for Australians "" has been dinned into our ears by the Labor candidates for Parliamentary honors in the past. In protesting against the curious and questionable method of the appointment of the director I feel I have every right so to do, not only on account of the satisfaction my system of training has given to the Royal Australian Engineers and the N.S.W. police, but, if for no other reason, in consideration of the high opinion formed of my physical culture work among senior cadets at the Victoria BarracksI know that that is quite correctover two years ago by their commanding officer, Major Wynne (now in command of the Coronation (?) contingent of Cadets). In the face of this and much similar documentary evidence of splendid results (including influential medical opinions), I feel that, speaking for myself, I at least should have had a chance of bringing my system under the searchlight of official scrutiny, with a view to its adoption, before the supreme appointment was made. But, no ! The principal post was filled through the back door, and when the favoured one was firmly seated in tbe official saddle applications were publicly invited for the subordinate positions. I , therefore, withdrew my application for the chief instructorship. I consider it a monstrous thing that in this ultra democratic land to-day so very undemocratic a method of making a public appointment could possibly have obtained as to create an entirely new and important official post to be filled by private favor, instead of inviting applications in the usual way. It merely goes to prove that no Parliamentary executive body, let alone individuals, can be trusted to justly perform even so simple and obvious a public duty unless legislation be enacted to prevent such abuses of office. As regards the appointment of a foreigner, I protest on no personal, but on broadly patriotic grounds. Is it not high time that the British people here and elsewhere cease being wilfully blind to the fact that foreigners in general do not reside on British soil for love of the Union Jack, but merely to exploit the British race when, where, and how they can, ousting British interests, business firms, and individuals on their own territory. It is time the whole British nation (not Australians alone) arose to a f u l l consciousness of our bounden duty to national kith and kin, bestowing patronage and custom among our true compatriots, where those compatriot! prove themselves worthy of such recognition. I do not wonder at Mr Close feeling aggrieved at his not being given at least an opportunity to apply for this important position of Director of Physical Culture. ment ? manent appointment, carrying with it the rank of honorary Lieutenant-Colonel. The complaint is a very serious one. In reading this extract from Mr Close's letter, I am reminded of Major Wynne and the contingent of cadets who went to the Coronation.

When on the high seas-whe n nearing the Old Country-Majo r Wynne, in his largeheartedness and patriotism, thought fit to despatch a wireless message congratulating His Majesty the King.

338,Mr Ryrie,"Let us see what the factsthe Old Country. I understand that the Minister of Defence, who was at the time iu London, was asked whether this was a Commonwealth Coronation contingent, officially recognised as such, and that he distinctly said that it was not. He did not explain that the reason why it was not an official Commonwealth contingent was that the Commonwealth Government could not afford the cost of sending one Home; and it seems to me very discreditable that such a statement should have been made. With all due respect to the Prime Minister, I think that the expense involved in his takas a Commonwealth contingent."" ing Home to the Coronation festivities a large retinue was altogether out of place, considering that the plea of expense had been put forward by the Government as a reason for refusing to send Home a Commonwealth contingent. There is not the least doubt that Major Wynne was snubbed for having transmitted the wireless message of congratulation to the King. Remembering that snub, he was, perhaps, rather chary of approaching either the Prime Minister or the Minister of Defence, and asking for any official recognition of the boys when they landed here on the return journey, and were about to visit Parliament House. Minister of Defence, should have been cognisant of all the movements of the contingent. It was not the commanding officer's place to approach him. Wynne and his contingent of cadets landed here, an order should have been awaiting him that the Government would be pleased if he would visit the Federal Parliament House and put the lads through some drill in the presence of honourable members. to have sent a motor to the vessel's side to threaten to camp the boys on the Embankmeet him. may seek to ridicule my remarks, but the general public do nol look with any complacency upon the treatment meted out to these lads. they are perfectly satisfied. satisfy them, on the point. Major Wynne may not have been au fait with the official etiquette relating to such a procedure as the sending of a message of congratulation to our King, but we must take it that he acted in the largeness of his heart. He sponsible for the boys having to depend was bursting, so to speak, with patriotic on their comrades in England? feeling, and thought it an excellent thing to do. When Senator Pearce, as Minister the boys. of Defence, was interrogated in London with regard to the standing of this contingent he might well have let them down lightly and have said, "" It is really not on official Commonwealth contingent. The Government did not send the cadets tp London, because it could not afford to do so; but I should regard it as a favour if the Home authorities would show them every consideration."" That would have cleared the path for Major Wynne and his cadets. Instead of doing so, however, the Minister said, "" They are not recognised I believe that Major Wynne threatened to camp the boys on the Thames Embankment, because preparations had not been made for their accommodation. But for' the intervention, primarily, of Lord Roberts, in all probability the boys would even have been denied their medals. As it was, they did riot get them when other contingents received their medals ; but this Government has since been forced to recognise the contingent, and to give them their Coronation medals. member reconcile his statement with the Senator Pearce, as statement. I have already made in this House, that whilst in England Senator Pearce asked Major Buckley, the High Commissioner's military adviser, to see that When Major accommodation was provided for the boys and was informed that it had been provided ? informed that Senator Pearce distinctly stated in London that it was not a Commonwealth contingent. We know that, as the result of that statement, trouble oocurred, and that Major Wynne had to ment because of the want of preparation for them. Seeing that popular feeling was in favour of the boys, however, the Minister probably took action at that stage, and received the reply to which the Honorary Minister has just referred. There is no doubt that the Minister of Defence practically repudiated the contingent altogether. of the kind.

There was no trouble about them. the action of the Minister of Defence in relation to the contingent was reprehensible. The Post and Telegraph Department is at present practically in a state of chaos. Any honourable member who endeavours to do a little business on the telephone will find at once that that branch of the service, at all events, is in an absolutely chaotic condition. The people of the Commonwealth are prepared to pay for an efficient service. If the trouble is want of money, then the money will have to be forthcoming. I believe the people will not grumble at the cost if they get an efficient service, but the question is how that is to be obtained.

I know that the temporary staff, more particularly the telegraphists, are often set to run. most important services, but they do not get anything like die salaries paid to the permanent telegraphists for doing the same class of work. Moreover, they are only engaged from day to day. They live practically with the dread of being dismissed for any paltry offence, or simply by reason of the fact that tiiey are not required any longer. Their position has become most unenviable recently by reason of the circular issued by the Minister of Home Affairs to his Department. They may be put off any day and see some one else put in their places.

Australia. Australia did in the vote on.the referenda. The Western Australians proved what they were then ; but let honourable members look at the intelligent vote cast on that occasion by the other States. We could expect nothing else from Western Australia. An honourable member has on the business paper a notice of motion for the adoption of the report of the Royal Commission on Postal Services, and when that matter is debated I shall have something further to say with regard to the Department. There is a great want of an official post-office at Greenwich, in my electorate. There is no official post-office between Crow's Nest and Chatswood. The district embodies a very large and populous area, and the fact that we have not an official post-office within a distance of from 4 to 5 miles is a disgrace. There are 2,300 people in the east ward of the municipality of Lane Cove, which covers this part, and the municipal revenue of the ward is .Â£2,400. The absence of an official post-office in the locality and I take it that Commander Clarkson is a bar to the progress of that flourisning district. The semi-official office is not at all satisfactory. It is at a grocer's shop, and the people get their letters and telegrams mixed up with pounds of tea, &c. There is no money-order office there. put this forward as a very serious grievance, and trust that the Postmaster-General will take steps to have it rectified. I again enter my protest against the granting of Supply for two months. If I could prevent it, the Government would not secure it. I exceedingly regret that the Treasurer has not seen fit to tell the Committee why he wants Supply for two months, considering that he proposes to bring down the Budget in a fortnight. ment of the debate on the Budget. in the way of bringing the Budget down for another two months. Unforeseen difficulties might prevent the Treasurer bringing it down during the session, but we cannot prevent honourable members opposite from doing practically what they like. We have to submit, and I will submit with the best grace possible, but I cannot do so without first entering my protest -The honourable and gallant member for North Sydney need have no fear that Parliament will not have full control over the voting of the Estimates for the year, even if Supply is granted now for two months. Parliament have when half the year is gone and the money is spent? have control over the other half of the year. Supply is being voted on the basis of the Estimates for the previous year. It would be singularly unfortunate if Parliament did not pass, the Estimates during the current session, because, I am afraid, Major Wynne and other gallant gentlemen might run short of half-a-year's salary, which would be an unfortunate incident. I have no string of grievances to ventilate; and a Supply -Bill of this character does not call for lengthy debate. I rose principally to call attention to the characteristic speech of the honourable member for Wentworth, who is a professor of everything in general, and of nothing in particular. That honourable member told us how Commander Clarkson had been sent Home in connection with the establishment of the Small Arms Factory; performed that work with satisfaction to the' Government, and, on his return, made some suggestions with regard to the management of the factory. Commander Clarkson, however, preferred to remain in I that branch of the service, where he has spent practically all his life, and has an excellent record. This gentleman, in addition to being an efficient engineer, has great scientific knowledge, being one who has a love of. going beyond his profession to acquire information. A charge often made against Governments is that they hunt round for square pegs to put into round holes. If we are to have a proper Naval Unit, it is essential that, in connection witb it, there should be men who know something about the business-me n who are recognised, at any rate, by the Admiralty, as efficient and able. If the proper place for Commander Clarkson is in connection with the Naval Unit, rather than with the Small Arms Factory, all honourable members will approve of his action except,",44,Elliot Johnson Wher E Is Accommodation North Sydney

366,Mr Archibald,"I suppose it. canperhaps, the honourable member for Wentworth. Commander Clarkson is, I should say, eminently fitted for a seat on the Naval Board; and I have yet to learn that that Board is expected to turn its attention to naval architecture. I was always under the impression that that is a distinct branch of professional knowledge; indeed, I do not know of any men on this side of the world who can claim to be authorities. If there has to be success in this connection we shall have to obtain the assistance of one, if not more, with expert knowledge. In my opinion, the Government, if they entrust the naval architecture to the Naval Board, will commit an error of judgment; and, as a matter of fact, I think the idea that the Government will do so has no more foundation than the lively imagination of the honourable member for Wentworth. It is not right for honourable members, when airing their grievances, to go out of their way to reflect on Commonwealth officers who have long records of faithful service, both State and Federal. have been made on Commander Clarkson? that Commander Clarkson declined to accept the office of manager of the Small Arms Factory. Personally, I should say that it was a good thing he did decline, because, although he might prove an efficient manager, he will prove far more useful in his own branch of the service. Another suggestion was that a gentleman, who had been sent to England by the Government, had no right to pick and choose; but it will be a sad day when the public servant cannot respectfully say, "" Sir, I think I can do better service in this, rather than in that branch."" ference to be drawn. As to immigration, I think a great deal can be done with advertisements of the character referred to this afternoon. Perhaps, in the large cities, advertising may be done to excess, and the average inhabitant, familiar as he is with broadsides, may not be so readily influenced as he was years ago. As to the competition of Canada, I look on the Dominion Government as a cipher in the matter; but by the Canadian-Pacific Railway Company, with their systematic advertising and thorough organization, much is done. I shall be the last to recommend any attempt to rival that company; but we can do a great deal more than in the past, and the sooner we Australians recognise the position the better. For obvious reasons, we have very few friends on the other side of the world. Recent troubles in England show that there is a tremendous amount of cheap labour there; and we are not an object-lesson of cheap labour, but an object-lesson of what a free Democracy can be. There are big interests represented in the English press which will not give Australia credit for. anything, if that can be avoided. This is not a party question. As Australians, we ought to be, and are, deeply interested in seeing that the claims of this great country are brought before the world. An amount of money, which need not be very large, could be very judiciously spent in engaging the services of men to lay the facts before the people of the Old Country. For this work, we ought to obtain Australians; and by that I do not necessarily mean native-born, but men who have spent the best part of their lives here, possibly twenty or thirty years, and know what the country is. Australia has to fight the press and vested interests in England; and our ablest weapon is the platform. What does the average Englishman know of Australia? On the other hand, what right would I have to speak.as an authority on my native land, after thirty-two years absence? I should regard any such attempt on my part as a piece of impertinence; to expect a Britisher to put the claims of Australia before the people of the Old Country is like expecting two and two to make five. Such men as I have suggested could, by the expenditure of a few thousand pounds, lecture to the people of the Motherland. And there are hundreds and thousands of men there, who are anxious to emigrate, and who would come this way if tiiey knew the facts. At present, however, they are bewildered by agents and advertisements. People who are acting for certain countries naturally "" run down "" Australia. It might be said diat information can be obtained at the offices of the Australian representatives in London; but there are many men who do not care to go to large official buildings on errands of that kind. Men with the requisite knowledge could tell in a popular way what Australia really is, and those associated with them could supply literature and further information.

371,Mr Charlton ((Hunter) [8.2,"4] -On cabled Home tbe information that there arethough very beautiful, are likely to do harm in attracting immigrants who, when they come here, will not find work. This deception, will injure Australia more than anything else. It would be better to work oil a system to ascertain in what trades and callings labour is needed, and to induce such labour to immigrate. The working men do not object to immigration, but they object to persons being brought here to work in occupations which are already crowded, because that means unfair competition and semi-starvation. In the Newcastle district if there were a very large number of miners offering they would be forced to fight each other to get work, and with the cut-throat competition among the proprietors, wages would come down. It is the duty of the Commonwealth and of the States to make it known in the Old Country that there is not employment here for miners, there being many collieries where work is very intermittent, and no guarantee of regular employment. The chairman of the Miners' Federation has stated the facts of the case applying to the Newcastle district. If the proprietors could guarantee regular work, they would have no trouble in getting men, but that is impossible, because so many mines have been opened up that there is not sufficient business for all. visit. I hope that the Prime Minister, now that he is seized of the facts, will prevent miners in the Old Country from being deluded by the statement that there is work for them in New South Wales. If other honourable members know of industries which are situated similarly to the coal mining industry, they should make tlie facts public. I wish now to refer to the statements of the honourable member for North Sydney regarding the attitude of the Minister of Defence towards the contingent of cadets which visited England at the time of the Coronation, under Major Wynne. According to the statement set out in the paper which has been laid on the table, it is evident that the Minister tried to do what was fair and just towards the cadets. Application was made in Jul}', 1910, for the Goveniment to sanction a subsidy of j Q i for jQi towards the expense of sending a cadet contingent Home. That was refused, and a similar application, made in October of the same year, by Major Wynne, was also refused. Later, Major Wynne was informed that leave of absence would be granted to selected officers, non-commissioned officers, ancl cadets, that arms and equipment would be issued on loan, and that the services of two non-commissioned officers of the In structional Staff would be given to assist at the preliminary camp, but that the Government would recognise no liability, financial or otherwise, in connection with the matter. Major Wynne went Home on that understanding. The Minister had previously agreed to cable to the Imperial authorities asking that a place might be allotted to the cadets on Coronation Day, and had sanctioned the issue of equipment ancl new pattern uniforms if they could be o got ready in time. The Minister also instructed Major Buckley, our Military Adviser in England, to see that accommodation was provided, and was informed that it would be. Regarding the presentation of Coronation medals, Lord Roberts was informed, in reply to a cablegram from him, that the Commonwealth Government had no objection to the cadets being considered eligible. The honourable member for North Sydney complained that the cadets were not fairly treated when they visited Parliament House yesterday, but I understand that Ministers were not informed of the intention to bring them here, and, therefore, did not put in an appearance. The least Major Wynne should have done was to notify the Minister of his intended been a simpleton to run any further risk. the Minister has acted unjustly towards the cadets is not borne out by the facts. 1 have put on record what really happened, because it would be unfair to allow the remarks of the honourable member for North Sydney to go without reply. He also spoke of the position of the temporary employees in the Post Oflice, but I have learned from the men tnemselves that they have been better treated since this Government came into power thau they were before. They have had an increase of wages, ancl their conditions have been improved. The honourable member stated that these temporary hands would lie dismissed, in all probability, because of the determination of the Government to grant preference to unionists. He must know, however, as other honourable members do, that temporary hands can be employed for only a limited period. When that time expires they must be dismissed, and either permanent or new temporary hands take their places. Preference to unionists has not interfered with them. If honourable members of the Opposition could point to one case of the kind they would justify their",47,Elliot Johnson Wher E Is Accommodation North Sydney
372,Mr Joseph Cook,He would have,48,Elliot Johnson Wher E Is Accommodation North Sydney
373,Mr Charlton,"The statement thatassertion, but I have no hesitation in saying that no temporary employ^ in the General Post Office has been dismissed because of the rule as to preference to unionists. In future appointments, however, unionists vvill have the preference. That, indeed, is very necessary, since the postal employees have their own unions, and if we recognised non-unionists trouble would be likely to arise. The inference to be drawn from the honourable member's statement was that o the Government had dismissed certain persons because of its determination to give preference to unionists. I reply that tney have not, and that the question of preference does not touch this matter. appointing new temporary hands unionists will be selected. about that, since the Public Service Commissioner, and not the Govermnent, has the control of appointments to the Postmaster General's Department. hands, .1 believe, have been in the service for three years. are excellent public servants. In my own electorate a young man, who has given every satisfaction, ancl whose services the public desire shall be retained, has been dismissed. On inquiry I found that he had been employed as a temporary hand in excess of the regulation time, and that the Public Service Commissioner could do nothing more for him. That is the true position. The Public Service Commissioner has to observe the regulations. I desire, in conclusion, only to emphasize the point that the Government should take care to make known in the Old Country the true position in regard to employment in Australia. It is wrong to allow men to be induced to come out here, in the belief that employment at good wages awaits them, only to find upon arrival that they have been deluded. Many of these men have to walk the streets, and find it impossible to earn sufficient to keep themselves, irrespective of what is necessary to maintain their wives and families in the Old Country. [8.44] -It is refreshing to hear my honourable friend, who has just resumed his seat, trying to explain away the inexpungable records of the Prime Minister's statements while in England. I fear that he has not quite so easy a task as he would lead us to believe by the light and airy way in which he seeks to set aside the whole matter. He asks that the Prime Minister shall send word to England that all that he told the workers while he wasthere was untrue. the miners.

I do not say that he should not have advised these miners to come to Australia.

I may add that almost all the trades dealt within this report, so far as male labour is concerned, have the protection of industrial awards, and this in itself would be a substantial breastwork against any attack upon the wages and conditions at present enjoyed. Later on he saysAs the evidence enables me to state with some precision the mini-mum number of additional handsfor whichState and private enterprises are tion want it for the detriment of the now ripe, I conclude that in a country like this theTe is no need to fear that any weakening of producing power or any falling' off in consumers' demands may bring about a decline in the: volume of employment as a result of the immigration here suggested. It is rather to be expected that the flood of human energy and skill poured into the veins of the body industrial will not only vitalize it highly for its present duties, but create in all its parts so strong a pulse and so sound a growth that before long a new necessity will arise for a fresh infusion of skilled as well as other immigrants."" This report means that every man who comes brings his necessities with him, and creates his own demands, and these, ramifying through the secondary employments which are requisite in order to keep him in economically efficient employment, create a greater and not a. less volume of employment..

HadI been in charge of the Department, Commander Clarkson would now have been manager of the Small Anns Factory. He was sent Home specially to look after all the business connected with the establishment of that factory; and everything that was done was on his recommendation, after the fullest investigation. He made several trips to America in pursuit of the latest information regarding the machinery, and he advised what is now being done. The understanding before he went away was that on his return he was to be the manager of the factory, at a salary, I think, of Â£ S o o a year.

In every industry in my electorate there are plenty of men to be obtained for a portion of the year though there are seven or eight months when they might do with more. What is to become of the extra men during the remaining four or five months?

That, no doubt, is a fact. We certainly do not want derelicts; we have too many of our own. If immigrants come here in However, I desire to address myhordes they will do harm, not only to themselves, but to those who are already here. The statement that the Labour party is opposed to immigration is on a par with other attacks which have been made on it. What we oppose is the flooding of Complaints are made the markets of Australia with labour which cannot be assimilated. We have no objection to immigration for which there is occupation. But what is now taking place in Victoria? In order that the reputation of the country may not suffer abroad, nativeborn workers are being discharged and places found for immigrants. I know of men who, unable to find work in the iron It was said during trade in New South Wales, have had to come to Victoria. But employers generally think that wages are too high, and to suit themselves are trying to introduce surplus labour. What is said about bringing out the proper class of men to place on the land is all clap-trap. For every immigrant placed on the land, fifty or sixty are left in the towns. Do members of the Opposition expect the Government to be false to its supporters by assisting immigration for the displacement of Australian workers and the lowering of wages? The honourable member for Hunter has shown what the conditions are in Newcastle.

The honourable member for Lang ridiculed our position by pushing it to a logical absurdity, contending that if the introduction of immigrants was a bad thing, it would improve conditions to send men away, and that if that principle were followed we should soon have no population at all. Of course, we all know that the increase of our population is desirable for the purpose of defence and for other reasons. have not enough people here for the area that we have to defend. At present, however, the States are bringing people here without discrimination, and in their rivalry are decrying one another's advantages. ting a fair number of immigrants. coming out here as fast as we can take them. would come if ships were provided. I am certain that under this system we shall get some very undesirable characters. If there is too much clap-trap talked, we shall have men coming out thinking that they can pick up gold in the streets, like many of those who came here fifty or sixty years ago. I hope that the Government when advertising Australia in England will do their best to counteract the glowing colours in which the States are too prone to paint the conditions that obtain here. that if we could settle more people on our lands it would be a great advantage to us. But to talk about settling them upon the land, whilst bringing out sixty artisans to find employment in our cities, as against every immigrant who obtains employment in the country, will only tend to make matters worse. I trust that the Government will watch the form of advertising that is undertaken in the Old Country, and will do their best to prevent the 'States inducing immigrants to come here at any cost. If steps be not taken in that direction, we shall, as the honourable member for Hunter has predicted, find men -walking the streets with no vocation to follow. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [9.36] I am one of those who desire to see a large population settled in Australia. That a young country, with such magnificent resources, should possess only 5,000,000 inhabitants is not a satisfactory condition of affairs. I am merely echoing the sentiments of honourable members on this side of the chamber when I say that I desire to see our population increase as fast as it is posNew South Wales Parliament. sible for the country to absorb it. But a difference has arisen between those who enthusiastically support an advanced immigration policy and those who are alleged to be opposed to immigration, although in reality they are not. The real point of difference is in regard to the absorption of immigrants upon such terms as will prove profitable to themselves, without inflicting injury upon others. I admit that there is a fear amongst We a large proportion of the working classes-amongs t those who have outof-work periods, and who labour for small wages-that if immigrants are brought here in considerable numbers they may be still further prejudiced in their intermittent employment. I am sure that we can sympathize with the position occupied by these workersa position which is a sad commentary upon our present indusWe are told, indeed, that more trial and social system. If we could devise a provision which would ease the difficulties of those who are faced at intervals with lack of employment, I am sure that a great deal of the objection which exists to an advanced immigration policy would disappear. Statements have been made by employers that they have ample room for large numbers of workmen in Australia, and on the other hand, representatives of the workers have affirmed I admit that there is abundant labour available here for both our primary and secondary industries. Quite properly the Labour Government in New South Wales desired to ascertain the real facts, and for that purpose they appointed Mr A. B. Piddington, a well-known barrister, a Commissioner to hear evidence from the contending parties, and to submit a report to the New South Wales Parliament. The Deputy Leader of the Oppoton as a friend of the Labour movement. I challenge the accuracy of his statement. I say that Mr Piddington is a very able barrister, that he is a gentleman who could be appointed a Royal Commission, and in that capacity could be depended upon to make an impartial investigation, and to submit an unprejudiced report. It was scarcely fair of that honordington is one of the advance guard of the Labour movement. He is nothing of the kind.

485,Able Member To Insinuate That Mr Pid,"But I believe that he has discharged his duties as a Royal Commissioner by making a thoroughly impartial investigation. He has heard from the employers all the evidence which they chose to put before him, and he has also heard all the evidence which the representatives of trade unions cared to bring under his notice. Having done that he has presented his report, in which he states that more than 3,000 workers, male and female, can be immediately absorbed in the industries of New South Wales. I am prepared to accept his finding. I do"" not think that anything is to be gained by those who hold a different opinion as to the ""condition of the labour market by seeking to belittle his report. They had an opportunity of placing their evidence before him, and consequently they ought to be prepared to accept his decision. At any rate, I am willing to do so, and I believe that in some of the industries of Australia to-day there is a shortage of workers, both male and female. If it is agreed that the vacant spaces of Australia should be filled, what should be the most convenient time to institute a policy of immigration? Surely, no better opportunity offers for the introduction of some of the able-bodied workers of other European countries than when we are enjoying unprecedented prosperity. The probabilities are that if an investigation similar to that which recently took place in New South Wales were made in the other States, it would be found that there are opportunities for the absorption of workers in certain industries. Cases in point have been brought under my own notice I have a brother who is connected with the management of one of the large Melbourne houses. He is not antagonistic to labour. His sympathies are entirely with it. Every vote he has given has been to labour, and I believe that he will always vote in that direction. He has no object to serve in misleading me in this matter, and he tells me that it is impossible to obtain the necessary labour in the business with which he is connected. Advertisements have been inserted in the Sydney press offering employment in Melbourne, and my brother has gone over there to endeavour to secure employees for an industry in this State. If , as the result of an investigation in the different States, it was shown that a certain number of workers could be absorbed by our various industries, we should have to endeavour to show those whose fear of times of intermittent employment induces Ur. J. H. Catts. them to take up an attitude strongly antagonistic to the introduction of additional workers, that their ideas must be tempered by the actual facts as they undoubtedly exist in relation to some of these industries. I am very glad to see a vote in the schedule to advertise the resources of Australia, for, from what I can learn from those who recently visited England, it is highly necessary that Australia should be better known, not only in Great Britain, but in other European countries. I have Heard in this House observations as to some of the States having control over immigration, and as to the way in which State is being played off against State, to the detriment of the Commonwealth as a whole. I sincerely trust that the time is not far distant when the power as to immigration, vested in this Parliament by the Constitution, will be actively exercised, and when the States will not be allowed to go into the labour markets of the world as States, pitted against each other, to the injury of the Commonwealth as a whole. This is one of the functions of the National Parliament, which has not been exercised beyond the expenditure of a few thousand pounds in advertising the resources of Australia. ordinate power. Mr J. H . CATTS -Quite so. But when a law of the Commonwealth conflicts with a law of a State, the Commonwealth law must prevail. That being so, the Commonwealth is in a position to set the pace, and to lay down the outstanding principles that should regulate not only the advertising of Australia, but the introduction of suitable immigrants. No doubt, within the next few years, as we exhaust some of the more pressing powers of legislation that have been referred to the Federal Parliament, greater prominence will be given to those of less urgency, and this Parliament will-be able to inaugurate, as against the various conflicting State policies, one great national policy in respect of immigration to Australia. shall watch very carefully any proposed vote on a large scale to attract immigrants, to Australia.

South Wales. busier at the present time than is any other part of the State. Every steamer coming to Australia from oversea has more than her f u l l complement of passengers, and before the end of the year, there will arrive by steamers already on the high seas more than 3,000 individuals. That fact in itself is an answer to the Commissioner's report: There is. .room for a .little over 3,000. skilled artisans, and we are-getting them.. Some of my friends who arrived recently from the Old Country tell me that it is necessary to book three or four months in advance in order to secure a berth on a steamer coming to Australia. The Commonwealth has been freely advertised, and a great stream of immigration is being directed to our shores. The whole trouble is that certain people are anxious to secure an over supply of labour for their own pecuniary benefit. T.Â«t me name a few of the classes who have that desire at heart. In the first place, boardinghouse-keepers believe, ih a constant stream of immigrants, knowing that their arrival from time to time -will keep their rooms engaged. again, hotel keepers favour' a large stream -of immigration because the immigrants will help to consume their beer, and to use the accommodation which their houses afford. Ladies requiring lady desire a large stream of . immigrants, so that they will be able to pick and choose, and make the poor unfortunate girls work all hours of the day. Because there is not a sufficient supply to meet their requirements, they are constantly calling out for more immigrants. They raise an outcry, because many of them do not treat their servants as well as they ought to do, that they cannot get girls and need a further supply of labour. Property owners are likewise calling' for more immigrants. In Sydney alone, rents have lately gone up from 40 to 50 per cent. Many people -cannot obtain houses. of affairs is very nice for the property owner. He calls Out for more immigration, because immigrants help to swell the demand for property. In Sydney, the rents of whole streets of shops have been increased from Â£ 1 to Â£ 2 per week. The result is that the workingmen have to pay increased house rents, and, by way of higher prices for their goods, to pay -the increased rents of the shopkeepers. Then, again, employers call for a Stream of immigrants because they desire what they describeas a ""healthy labour market."" When they advertise for -a workman they' want a crowd of men to offer their services Because there is a scarcity of labour, and they cannot pick and choose to the extent that they have hitherto been able to do, they ask for more immigration. We, as a Labour party, desire immigrants to come to Australia. We desire that the country shall be developed, and we shall welcome immigrants if there is employment to offer them. When the construction of the transcontinental railway is entered upon, we shall be able to offer inducements to. people to settle on tlie land along the line. We shall thenbe able to afford people opportunities to take up land instead . of crowding into the cities. When we .develop the Northern Territory-whic h comprisessome of the best lands in the Commonwealth-w e shall also be prepared to support a vote to attract to our shores people who will be able to settle along the route of the railway to be constructed there. Then, ritory contains. some of the finest country to be found in Australia, and it all belongs to the Commonwealth. If we are going to construct a railway through the Northern Territory, at a cost of millions, we should helps always spend a few more millions in settling persons on our land. But I object to immigrants being brought into the congested cities. According to what I have read the cities in the Old Country are over-crowded. I fear that we are following its example. In Australia we want to develop the country and not the cities. Those who emigrate to Australia to-day try to live in thc cities. We cannot blame them for taking that course, because they were brought up to city life. They do not seem to like to go into a"" healthier atmosphere,' where they could earn a comfortable living, and rear healthy children. No matter what GoSuch a state vernment may be in power, I shall exercise my influence to prevent the provision of any large sum for bringing out immigrants until we have suitable land for them to settle on, and, of course, a demand for labour in the country. ber like the picture which has been referred to?",57,Chairman Th E Honourable Able Member For Hindmarsh I Did Not
