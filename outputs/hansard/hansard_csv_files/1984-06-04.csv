We have tried to relieve that today the efforts we will make to avoid, as far as situation in two ways: First of all, by providing a possible, intrusion into personal affairs. The test much bigger threshold; that is, adding $50,000 to will be essentially a self-assessment procedure in the basic threshold for pensioners who are nonrelation to personal effects and household conhome owners. Secondly, and much more importtents, and that of course will be in relation to the antly, because most of these pensioners who do great mass of the pensioner population.

Again, the lower evidence we have that they are unlikely to meet thresholds that we have introduced will help to these very high threshold levels and, therefore, overcome avoidance under those particular levels. they simply need to confirm that. I believe therefore that we can reduce the problem of intrusion, Of all the schemes that have been presented, at least as far as is possible. I believe that those this is the most simple of design and the most easy self-assessment procedures and the high threshold of understanding. When it is said that it brings in levels we have set will in fact avoid much of the very little money, particularly in the first year, intrusion that has been talked about. As we have there are a number of points to be made. We are said, overall it is estimated that only about 40,000 not simply concerned with the revenue implipensioners-that is less than 2 per cent of all cations of this scheme.

In adnot totally discriminatory against those who, at dition, this assets test will minimise the opportunithe moment, are in the age pension bracket. We ties for avoidance that are proliferating under the need to remember that, just by definition, they present scheme.

The fact of the this legislation. matter is that there will be many cases when the notice was given but on which it is said: 'No, I did The next point I should like to make relates to not get the notice'. This is so because a lot of the disclosure provisions. It is provided by clause money will rest on it.

Let us remember something else about inThere are further provisions. Why should the surance companies and the attitudes of Auscourt be entitled to disregard fraudulent tralians to insurance companies. The insurance misrepresentation? An example is given in the company is fair game. How many times have we second reading speech which stated that there all heard of people making claims against the inmay be fraudulent misrepresentation which has surance company and giving it the best possible nothing to do with the matter. Fraud goes to the run that they can? Is it not said: 'I did not get it heart of contracts. We have to ask ourselves last time, so I should get it this time. And in any whether we, as insurers, would refuse to deal with event they have a lot of money'. That, of course, is a person who was willing fraudulently to misrepone reason why the insurance companies are so resent to us his past history or who was willing tough, or can be so tough, in insisting on full disfraudulently to misrepresent to us elements which closure.
