Wednesday, 9 May 2007 ----Water my electorate: the Howard government’s recent proposal to take water from northern New South Wales to Queensland. One of the proposals that has been put forward by the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources involves building a dam in the village of Tyalgum. Our precious water would then be sent over the border to the Gold Coast-an area that has been overdeveloped and inadequately planned for. I am totally opposed to the plans of the environment minister, the Prime Minister and the National Party to take precious water from our rivers for use by the overdeveloped Gold Coast. As the federal member for RichmondI make no apologies for standing up for locals and fighting to protect the best interests of the residents of the Richmond electorate. My main concerns about this proposal include the devastating effect that the building of a dam would have on the village of Tyalgum and the surrounding areas and the sustainability and future of our river. Our river’s health and ecosystem are of the utmost importance. There are very serious environmental consequences associated with this proposal. Many local industries rely on our river-for example, tourism, farming and fishing. This proposal would have a significant impact on local jobs, and that is certainly an issue that many locals have raised with me. I am also very concerned about the future water needs of the Tweed region. It is of utmost importance that our water requirements are looked after. In a report in the Australian on 16 April 2007, the Prime Minister referred to this proposal to pump water from northern New South Wales. He said that it passes a ‘common sense pub test’. I challenge the Prime Minister to go to any pub in the Northern Rivers and talk to the locals about this plan. I do not think he or the environment minister would be game to go to the Tyalgum pub and talk about this plan. I do not think they would get a very good hearing at all. This plan is self-serving and ill conceived. It is another example of how this governmentin particular, the National Party-has abandoned and forgotten regional and rural Australia. Last week, over 300 locals attended a public meeting in Tyalgum to voice their concerns about this proposed dam and how it would destroy their village and the surrounding areas. Our community have been very vocal in our opposition to this plan. Last week I launched a petition and, so far, hundreds of locals have signed it. Our community will stand united on this issue and fight to stop this dam. It is a major issue in the electorate, and people have so many concerns. I call on the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources to rule out a dam in northern New South Wales and taking water from northern New South Wales to Queensland. I make no apologies for standing up for the people of Richmond on this matter; our water and our water needs are of utmost importance, as are preserving our rivers, our ecosystems and our rural villages. These are my main concerns, and I want answers from the environment minister. I want him to rule out this dam in northern New South Wales and to rule out taking water from our area to Queensland. MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Great Barrier Reef Marine Marine Park Act 1975 To Include Recommen
190,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley) Took The Chair At 9.30 Am.,,170,Statements By Members
191,Mrs Elliot (Richmond) (9.30 Am),"I rise today to speak on a very important issue inWater the Queensland Labor government to steal water from the Sunshine Coast to give to Brisbane, which is in a desperate situation because of the Labor government’s failure in the past to plan. The water issue has not been far from the front-page headlines in recent months, and there would be few who doubt that it will continue to be very prominent. We on the Sunshine Coast are very upset about the attempted move by the state Labor government to pipe water from our region’s largest water supply, Lake Baroon, to Brisbane. The extreme water shortages in south-east Queensland are the result of the Rudd Labor government’s failure to build the Wolfdene dam a number of years ago. the premier, Kevin Rudd was his chief of staff. Lake Baroon is one of those facilities that will be linked via the water-grid network to a thirsty population in Brisbane. Local residents of the Sunshine Coast have been blessed with an adequate water supply as a result of sensible planning foresight by the Maroochy and Caloundra councils-and we may well pay a financial penalty for that foresight. Lake Baroon is relatively young, with its construction having been completed as recently as 1989. It covers some 380 hectares and is the main water supply for the Caloundra and Maroochy local government areas. It is located within a very efficient catchment, and it is not altogether unusual to have a relatively small downpour that makes a bigger than expected impact on water levels in the dam. When full, it holds a maximum of 61,000 megalitres. The intention of the state Labor government is to pipe water from Lake Baroon to Brisbane. Brisbane has a number of other water supplies with much higher capacities. It is not hard to see that Lake Baroon would have little impact on the overall water demands of Brisbane, yet its connection to the water grid would come at considerable cost to local residents, who will find themselves suffering considerable water restrictions and, quite possibly, disastrous water shortages as well as increased water costs. We have also been told that it is possible that local Sunshine Coast residents will have to fund the cost of the pipeline which will take their resource away from them. That is astounding. Water in south-east Queensland would not be the problem it is now had the Labor government taken sensible decisions in the past and planned for our increased population. It does seem that the state Labor government is determined to deprive Sunshine Coast residents of their planned water supplies by piping our water to Brisbane. If the water goes to Brisbane it will not make any difference to Brisbane but it will make a huge difference to the Sunshine Coast. I condemn the state Labor government. Hume Highway Hume Highway between Ingleburn and Campbelltown. The widening is not simply to deal with the increased commuter traffic, although it will contribute to managing the effects of urban growth in south-west Sydney.

195,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (9.36 Am),"TodayI rise to speak about the campaign to widen thein effect doubling the traffic flow over the next 20 years. Sydney’s population is likely to hit five million over the next 25 years and 20 per cent of that growth is expected to occur in the south-west fringes of Sydney. The south-west growth centre will include new communities, providing homes for up to 250,000 people and approximately 10,000 hectares of employment land. The economic case for widening the Hume Highway between Ingleburn and Campbelltown revolves around the establishment of intermodal terminals and their connectedness with not only the M7 corridor and other freight transport networks but also Port Kembla, which is set to expand and include the importation of cars under the New South Wales government’s threeports strategy. Without widening the section of road between Campbelltown and Brooks Road, the congestion at this bottleneck will be exacerbated as a result of increased freight movements from the intermodal facilities around Ingleburn and Minto. The possible construction of another intermodal facility on the defence land at Moorebank will add further pressure to local road networks and, more importantly, the Hume Highway. The draft AusLink Sydney-Wollongong corridor strategy indicates that the relocation of car importations to Port Kembla will result in 250,000 vehicles arriving annually. It is expected that at least 50 per cent of those vehicles will be shipped by B-double road transport to Minto or Ingleburn for pre-delivery inspection and distribution to retailers throughout south-west Sydney. For local job creation and managing the growth in freight transport between Sydney and Port Kembla it is important that the road be widened. This will allow for the expansion of Campbelltown based industries, with the associated growth of local jobs. It will also allow the benefits of the F5 to be fully realised. I hope some of the $22.3 billion earmarked in the budget for roads and rail finds its way to the widening of the F5. (Time expired) Budget 2007-08 Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (9.39 am)-I am very pleased that in last night’s budget announcement $10 million was allocated by the Australian government for a Centre for Innovation in Cancer at Flinders Medical Centre. This project is an important project for the electorate of Boothby, and it has been a long-term priority for Flinders University, Flinders Medical Centre and the Flinders Medical Centre Foundation. I am particularly pleased as this has been the culmination of 12 months work. I want to pay tribute to Professor Graeme Young, Dr Rhys Williams and Ms Deborah Heithersay of the Flinders Medical Centre Foundation. It all began last year, the day after the budget announcement-so one year exactly-when I realised there was money available for medical research and approached Professor Young about putting in a submission for this year’s budget. It required meetings with several cabinet ministers, visits to Sydney and visits to Canberra in September, October and November. The project will be a $21½ million project. There are other people who have made contributions. The state government has made a $2½ million contribution. There have also been a lot of donors, particularly from the southern suburbs of Adelaide. They have a great function, the Pink Ribbon Ball, which has had building this cancer centre as its goal. The cancer centre will be a comprehensive cancer centre of a type that we do not have in Australia. It will have a particular focus on prevention. As our population ages, we will see an increasing cancer burden. It is estimated that over this decade we will see a 30 per cent increase in the incidence of cancer. That means that, while virtually all of the spending is conMAIN COMMITTEE centrated on treatment and even on end-stage care, it is very important that we focus on prevention on the precancerous stage because that will actually help to reduce the burden. The cancer centre will integrate research and clinical care. They will have translational research as well, which will mean the research they will be doing will be applied to patients. This will be particularly good for residents in the southern suburbs of Adelaide who use the Flinders Medical Centre. I am told that the facility should be open by 2009, and patients will get the benefit of a state-of-the-art, world-class facility at Flinders. Mr Andrew Johns Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (9.42 am)-On behalf of tens of thousands of Novocastrians, I pay tribute in the House to Newcastle’s very own sporting hero and favourite Knight, Andrew Johns. For his fans, his colleagues, his family and friends, 10 April, the day he announced his retirement from the game, was one of great sadness but also great relief. There is nothing quite like 25,000 people holding their breath when Joey goes down in a game, so I suppose the relief was about him not ever compromising his future life through crippling injury. Joey’s record in Rugby League is exceptional-15 years at the elite level; three DallyM awards; two Golden Boot awards; 23 State of Origin games for New South Wales; 21 tests, including two World Cups and a Kangaroos tour; a 10-year representative career, including captaining New South Wales and Australia; Rugby League’s all-time highest point scorer; second highest goal scorer; and the most capped player for the Newcastle Knights, with 249 first-grade games. Joey deserves a tangible legacy. After leading the Knights to a heroic grand final victory in 2001, Andrew Johns, trophy in hand, told fans and the Prime Minister: ‘I think you deserve a new stadium.’ He was right. Andrew Johns was part of a delegation to this place in 2002 asking the federal government for funding for our stadium. Regrettably, however, that proposal for stadium funding has sat idle with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for five years. In that time, the state Labor government has spent $34 million to build a new eastern stand, now named the Andrew Johns Stand in his honour. In March, the state government pledged a further $30 million for the western stand if only the feds would put in. I have tabled petitions from 10,000 people from right around the Hunter supporting the upgrade. But, as budgets come and budgets go, this government has given nothing and totally ignored the call of 10,000 voters. Bob Baldwin, the member for Paterson, is the only member in the Hunter still sitting on the sideline, and his government cannot even come onto the park. In last night’s budget, yes, we saw the tick-off for $25 million for Adelaide Oval and $25 million for the Sydney Cricket Ground, but nothing for Newcastle. We have also seen similar funding in the past-St George’s Kogarah Oval, $8 million; Penrith stadium, $10 million; Toyota Park, $9 million; and Whitten Oval, $8 million-but nothing for Newcastle. Just what kind of clout does the member for Paterson actually have when he lets $85 million in sports stadium funding pass by our region? When Andrew Johns retired, Kevin Rudd noted that whenever Joey took the field he ‘delivered in spades’. It is very important that the Prime Minister now delivers in spades to the people of Newcastle and it is very important that our very own legend-we hope, the next MAIN COMMITTEE immortal in the game of Rugby League-will be recognised in a very tangible way with the western grandstand being completed with much deserved federal money. Andrew Johns, you will always have our support and our best wishes for your future in our hearts. (Time expired) Flinders Electorate: Bitumen Plant am)-I rise today to express my clear and absolute opposition on behalf of the people of Crib Point, the people of Hastings and many other members of the electorate of Flinders to the ridiculous proposal for a bitumen plant on the edge of the town of Crib Point. It is the reindustrialisation of a town that has become a residential community. It is not an appropriate use for the land, which is right on the edge of residences. Firstly, a consequence will be truck movements in and out of the town of Hastings, throughout Crib Point and through Bittern. All of those areas will be facing numerous Bdouble trucks on a daily basis, right through the middle of a residential corridor-right through residential streets. Secondly, the odours will have an impact on potential house values and on the quality of life and amenity for those who are living adjacent to or near the bitumen plant. Thirdly, it would effectively destroy the Hastings and Crib Point submarine project. That project is a community project. What has happened here is that the Port of Hastings has allowed the proposal for a bitumen plant to effectively rule out a long standing community proposal by taking the land, which had been allocated for a community proposal, away from the Oberon submarine project-the HMAS Otama, a submarine that was gifted by the Commonwealth, along with an additional $450,000, to the town and the community of Hastings and Crib Point. It would destroy that project. For all of those reasons, this is not acceptable. Moreover, it is a breach of an express, clear and absolute promise made by the current state government of Victoria prior to the state election of 2006. I repeat: it was an express, clear and absolute promise that there would be no bitumen plant in Crib Point. Going forwards, I have written to the Minister for Roads and Ports, the Hon. Tim Pallas, seeking two things: firstly, a meeting; and, secondly, an undertaking that this proposal not only will not be allowed to proceed but will not be allowed to derail the Hastings submarine project. The Western Port Oberon Association is a group of locals. They have worked on this for five years. They have been the victims of a long process of indecision by the state government in relation to a series of sites. The bitumen plant should not proceed. The submarine project should be approved immediately. (Time expired) Human Rights: China sional committee on foreign affairs representative, Tom Lantos of California, in expressing his concern that the Beijing Olympics not be used as a catalyst for oppression by the government in China. Nearly one-tenth of the population from scattered hamlets in Tibet-250,000 Tibetans-have been relocated forcibly by the Chinese communist regime to ‘socialist villages’. The broader aim of this forcible resettlement seems to be, according to a report in the Australian, to remake Tibet, a region with its own culture, language and religious traditions, and give firmer control to the central government. ‘China is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into road building and development projects in Tibet, boosting the economy, maintaining MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Statements By Members
196,Mr Hunt (Flinders,Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (9.45,174,Statements By Members
197,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (9.48 Am),"I want to join the chairman of the US congresa large military presence and keeping close tabs on the locals via a vast security apparatus of cameras and informants.’ Human Rights Watch reports that peasants must take out loans of several thousand dollars to pay for these houses, which cost an average of $US6,000, even though annual rural incomes hover around $US320 in the deeply impoverished region. In that context it is worth, sadly, recounting that more than 10 years have passed since the Panchen Lama, the No. 2 person in the Tibetan religion, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, went missing. He was arrested as a young child by the Chinese government. It is also nearly 10 years since the Catholic bishop Su Zhimin was arrested by the Chinese government. I call on the authorities in Beijing to release these two religious leaders before the Beijing Olympics. It is simply not good enough for the world to let China have a prestigious international gathering like the Beijing Olympics and ignore human rights in China or freedom for people there who are leaders of major religions. I find it personally quite shocking that a child who is the No. 2 in the Buddhist religion, the Panchen Lama, is held prisoner by the Chinese government. I also find it shocking that someone who is a bishop of the Catholic church is imprisoned in China, as are a number of other Catholic bishops who recognise, as do all true Catholics, the authority of Rome and not the authority of Beijing in terms of their own religion. I conclude by noting that His Holiness the Dali Lama will be here in Australia again from 5 June to 16 June, and I think all Australian democrats of all Australian political parties will welcome him to this House. We think that the important message that he brings of the middle way of Tibetan autonomy within the Chinese federation is a moderate political program that the Chinese authorities should listen to. They should also free individual human rights activists, including all those internet activists, journalists and labour activists whose names will be presented to our Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. (Time expired) Brisbane Urban Corridor said very plainly that there are too many interstate trucks on local roads in the electorate of Moreton, mainly because there has been no local traffic plan-no plan to tell the trucks where to go. We put bigger and bigger trucks on the roads, we do not build roads that are suitable for those vehicles-we just expect them to use and find their way through suburban streets, some of them very small, most of them completely ill equipped for it. Local people have been backing my efforts over the past decade when it comes to the Brisbane Urban Corridor-that is, Granard Road, Riawena Road, Kessels Road and Mount Gravatt-Capalaba Road. I am pleased to inform the House that, after a decade of urging, the state government have finally listened and they have erected a sign that tells the trucks to use the alternative route, the exact thing I have been calling for for a decade on behalf of local residents. In the meantime, the Australian government has delivered $1.7 million in toll-free access to the alternative route that we have been pointing the trucks to. It is a toll road. The state government use this road to make money. It is the only toll road in the entire state of Queensland. It is the most purpose-built road for heavy vehicles, yet they put a toll on it. The $1.7 million has taken 221,000 trucks over the last two years off this road at night, so residents between 10 pm and 5 am are able to get some sleep, and the state government now have put signs up telling trucks to use this toll road or else they will face fines. They have put load limits on the Kessels Road corridor. After a decade of telling me that it is a federal road and they cannot do anything about it, the state government have finally fessed up that they had the auMAIN COMMITTEE",174,Statements By Members
198,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (9.51 Am),"On many occasions over the last decade I havethority to fix it, and fix it they could, and they are finally now doing it. They are monitoring trucks and asking them why they are on that road. WhatI am concerned about is that all of this is subterfuge for a complete failure to have a proper local traffic plan. The effect of the state government’s action so far with the toll road still in place is that McCullough Street, Sunnybank and Padstow Road through Eight Mile Plains are now wearing those heavy trucks. Beenleigh Road through Sunnybank Hills, Runcorn and Kuraby are now wearing those heavy trucks. Compton Road through Sunnybank Hills, Calamvale and Stretton are now wearing those heavy trucks because there is no local traffic plan. All of those other roads are council and state government controlled roads. I call on the Brisbane City Council and the state government to recognise that their authority on those roads is absolute. They must ensure a couple of things: (1) through that road traffic plan tell the trucks to stay out of residential areas in order to get B-doubles off those roads and (2) get rid of the toll on the southern Brisbane bypass, the only tolled road in the entire state of Queensland, a road purpose built, and allow those trucks to use that road instead and direct them there. The big concern for local residents is that federal Labor still want to put more trucks through my area. They still want to see the widening of the Ipswich Motorway delivering more trucks to the Kessels Road corridor. That is their platform, and they stand condemned. (Time expired) Parliamentary Education Office Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (9.55 am)-I know there are so many other portfolio matters that could be talked about in relation to the budget but we do not always get a chance to mention some of the important things that happen in our electorate. I am very keen to have the opportunity to do this here today because it relates to the excellent work of the Parliamentary Education Office, that have just last week conducted a fantastic training program in my electorate. We were extremely lucky to have them agree to come and do an outreach program in my electorate. We had over 1,200 children, mostly grade 5s and 6s, who went through the program. I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, and other members here have had students who have travelled to Canberra and had the benefit of the office’s fantastic training skills and the role-play which gets the kids to be the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow health minister and the health minister and to debate a bill. They did that at Victoria University. They debated a bill, which they had prepared, about type 2 diabetes. The bill was about $500 million being spent in a particular way. They had to argue for and against it. Some of them had put in enormous amounts of research and made very detailed statements. Others maybe put in less research on the topic but had done a lot of research about how many of us might behave in the parliament and had all of the actions and antics-some of which we would not encourage, but others of which kept their colleagues very entertained. It was a fantastic learning experience for the students. Many of these students cannot come to Canberra because of the cost-not of getting into the parliament but of getting here, the travel and the overnight stay. I am very pleased that there have been some changes so that students who travel from Melbourne get a small contribution. That was the result of a lot of campaigning by many people but it still is not sufficient for many of the schools to be able to visit Canberra as part of their educational program. The MAIN COMMITTEE office coming to the electorate gave a huge range of students a new opportunity. They absolutely loved it. I am sure that among those students there are people who have become interested in politics and daily affairs and what happens in our parliaments and governments around the country in a way that they would not have been without this work. I wanted to say a particular thank you to Rick and Erin from the Parliamentary Education Office, who were fantastic. I wish that there was more funding available for them to do more of these outreach programs across the country. I was particularly delighted that Victoria University agreed to participate because it meant that one of the sessions had all of the undergraduate teachers there to see how these methods worked and to see how the children actually lit up with the idea of being able to be in a role-play. It is something to which we have exposed not just the students but the next generation of teachers as well. I want to put on the record very firmly my thanks for the great work that the Parliamentary Education Office have done. (Time expired) Gilmore Electorate firmed. I have made it my business to acquaint myself with the new areas of Gilmore and the people living there. I am grateful to my colleague the Special Minister of State and the member for Eden-Monaro, Gary Nairn, who has assisted me in the familiarisation process as I gradually move about. Over the last few weeks I have opened an outreach office in Batemans Bay which is located in the Stockland Shopping Centre and will be manned by both staff and volunteers. Because the electorate is so geographically elongated I thought it only fair to constituents to provide an accessible service rather than to expect them to travel to Nowra for an appointment. In addition I have instituted a series of regular village stops, an extension of a practice I have followed since becoming the member for Gilmore. RecentlyI was given a visual tour and a briefing by the Eurobodalla Shire Council on issues affecting the community, giving me a better appreciation of matters affecting residents in the new areas. The Batemans Bay region is not only very picturesque but very vibrant. I know that many residents of the ACT visit regularly on holidays and day trips. The local economy depends significantly on the tourism dollar, so in that respect that part of the electorate has similarities with the Shoalhaven and Kiama regions. RecentlyI was made aware of some service problems with the Batemans Bay Hospital and, in that context, I will be working cooperatively with the state member for Bega, Andrew Constance, to see whether we can get a better deal for the community. In fact I have set up a meeting with local doctors to discuss that very issue. Batemans Bay has also seen the establishment of a marine park by the New South Wales government and that has created some angst in the community. The approach by the New South Wales government in establishing the park has raised some questions reminiscent of a previous pattern that I have witnessed in other coastal areas of the Gilmore electorate. My predecessor has achieved much during his term as member, and I am hopeful of building on that record. This will take a lot of effort by many people, and I am hopeful that in the months ahead I will be given ample opportunity to meet with local community groups and to listen to their hopes and plans. So far I have been made very welcome. As we get to know each other there will be opportunities identified where I can assist the community to obtain funding. For instance, this week I distributed a survey to gauge the feeling in the community MAIN COMMITTEE",175,Statements By Members

Of course, the announcement in the budget last night of further funding for universities bodes very well for the Batemans Bay complex. With regular feedback of this kind, the aspirations of the community can be identified and energy focused on getting the best outcomes through a cooperative approach. I look forward to being elected again as the member for Gilmore and hope that between now and then I can show the people of Batemans Bay my sincerity in representing their views to government and being part of their community. 193 the time for members’ statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 29 March, on motion by Mr Abbott: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (10.01 am)-I rise today to speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (Inappropriate and Prohibited Practices and Other Measures) Bill 2007. The bill proposes to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 to replace existing prohibitions on the payment of medical benefits for pathology and diagnostic imaging services. The new provisions are aimed at, firstly, prohibiting certain practices in relation to the rendering of pathology and diagnostic imaging services, including prohibiting inducements and other relationships between requesters and providers of pathology services and diagnostic imaging services; secondly, preventing payments for pathology and diagnostic imaging services that do not benefit patients; and, thirdly, encouraging fair competition between pathology and diagnostic imaging providers on the basis of quality services provided and the cost to patients. These new provisions represent a response to persistent long-term claims that a minority of providers, particularly within the pathology industry, were providing payments or other inducements to practitioners so that practitioners would refer patients to them. For example, pathology companies and third parties acting for them have allegedly been offering inflated rents, gifts, lump sum payments and staff to general practices to encourage referrals. There have also been some reports of doctors actively soliciting inducements, gifts and benefits. Of course, it is always impossible for us to know the extent or veracity of a range of these claims, and I do emphasise that there is no suggestion that many of the providers who do great work for us in the community are participating in these practices, but there have nevertheless been persistent claims. There are I think very legitimate concerns for us to be acting upon and it is important that the government has taken some action to make sure that those people who are doing the wrong thing are able to be covered by the legislation and stopped from participating in these sorts of practices. While current sections-129AA, which deals with bribery, and 129AAA, which deals with prohibited practices in relation to the rendering of pathology services-of the Health Insurance Act do contain a range of provisions addressing bribery, inducements, overservicing and prohibited practices relating to the provision of services, ongoing reports from within the pathology industry do allege that these provisions are being circumvented by operators who are MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Statements By Members
200,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley),"Order! In accordance with standing ordercontravening the known intent of the legislation. The provisions have been ineffective in their deterrent and enforcement aspects for the relevant agencies. Medicare Australia and the DPP have been unable to successfully prosecute any alleged offenders. Among the difficulties identified with the current provisions relating to pathology are that they are expressed very broadly, their scope is unclear, it is difficult to discharge the burden of proof, it is difficult to determine the preconditions for application of the relevant sanctions and it is difficult to establish the facts necessary to apply the relevant sanctions. The sections also apply differentially to requesters and providers of these services. Obviously, when this line of complaint can be made about the existing provisions, it is important to take the action that the government has taken so that we ensure that the people who are determined to get around the intent of those laws are able to be caught by the new provisions which we are debating in the bill today. With regard to the current prohibitions that I have just listed, and the range of problems with them, the diagnostic imaging servicing provisions contained in division 3 of part IIB do not carry any criminal or civil sanctions at all. This bill sensibly repeals these sections and replaces them with a new part IIBA, which sets out new provisions relating to both pathology and diagnostic imaging services. These changes arise from several thorough reviews of the operation of Commonwealth legislation for pathology arrangements under Medicare. In 2002, the Department of Health and Ageing undertook a review of Commonwealth legislation for pathology arrangements under Medicare, including the Health Insurance Act. The final report was released in December 2002 and noted then that the legislative arrangements for regulating pathology services needed updating and streamlining. The report particularly highlighted the areas of offences and enforcement provisions. You can see from that that these problems have been around for some time. It has certainly taken some time to get where we are today, but we welcome being able to debate what will hopefully close down some of the persistent rumours and any untoward activities that some providers might be involved in. After the review in 2002, in 2005 the Department of Health and Ageing commissioned a further review, undertaken by Phillips Fox lawyers, to specifically examine the pathology enforcement and offence provisions. The review included extensive consultation with pathology providers, professional and peak industry groups, state and federal government agencies, and consumer groups. The Phillips Fox review did not attempt to substantiate any of the actual allegations concerning inducements for service providers or claims that some medical practitioners were demanding payments from pathology providers; rather, the authors of the review accepted that ‘the frequency and consistency of claims made across the sector generates a high level of confidence that such conduct is, in fact, occurring’. That was a quote from the review. The Phillips Fox review made 52 recommendations, including the need to redraft the enforcement and offence provisions to express more clearly the government’s intent to prevent benefits and bribes between pathology providers and requesters of services and to extend the application of provisions to create an enforcement framework that can be more effectively applied. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, accepted the bulk of the Phillips Fox report’s recommendations when he released the government’s response to the report on 2 June last year. MAIN COMMITTEE It is clear from all of this background that the current legislation has proven ineffective in tackling persistent claims of overservicing and prohibited practices within the pathology sector particularly. Of course, we all know that, if there is inappropriate use-and this is why the government is acting sensibly-this is a great cost to Medicare and the health system more generally. To put this in perspective for those who are listening to or reading this debate and do not always deal with the detail that we need to deal with in this place, 83 million Medicarefunded pathology services were performed in 2005-06, with approximately 10 million Australians accessing those services. During the same period, approximately 15 million Medicarefunded diagnostic imaging services-such as X-rays, ultrasounds, and CT and MRI scanswere performed, benefiting more than 6½ million Australians. This equates to expenditure in excess of $3.2 billion, representing approximately 30 per cent of the total Medicare outlay in that year. This is obviously a big chunk of the Medicare budget. If there is anything that can be done to stamp out inappropriate practices, particularly when those practices pass on a cost-usually to the government-and do not necessarily benefit the consumer, then obviously action needs to be taken. Of course, while it is impossible for us to quantify the level of inappropriate servicing in these sectors, the explanatory memorandum to this bill notes that a 0.5 per cent reduction in Medicare-funded pathology and diagnostic imaging services, by tackling inappropriate use of Medicare funding, would nevertheless result in a saving of approximately $16 million a year. If this is a widespread practice, the savings would be much more significant. If it is not a widespread practice, that is still an amount of money that could be put to better use. Particularly in budget week when we debate these sorts of things, we know that there are plenty of worthy things that we can spend money on in the healthcare budget, and we do not want any of it to go astray because of these inappropriate practices. Labor knows how important it is to get the most out of the healthcare dollar and will always support measures which will result in savings to Medicare and the health system more broadly. If even a fraction of inappropriate servicing by pathologists or diagnostic imaging services is tackled with this new regime, it will free up much needed resources for other areas of the health system. Let me turn now to some detailed consideration of the provisions of the bill. Schedule1 amends the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Medicare Australia Act 1973 and the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986. Schedule2 makes some minor procedural amendments to the Health Insurance Act and the pathology services regulations. The major amendments are to the Health Insurance Act and involve the repeal of the current prohibited practices provisions, as I have already mentioned, and insert a new part IIBA, which contains the new civil penalty provisions and offences relating to requests for both pathology and diagnostic imaging services. The new part IIBA contains three divisions. Division1 outlines procedural and definitional aspects related to the new part, including the meaning of ‘requester’ and ‘provider’, one of those issues that was dealt with in the earlier reviews. For pathology services, ‘requester’ means: (a) a practitionerMAIN COMMITTEE defined in section 3(i) of the Health Insurance Act as a medical practitioner or a dental practitioner(b) a person who employs, or engages under a contract for services, a practitioner; (c) a person who exercises control or direction over a practitioner (in his or her capacity as a practitioner). For diagnostic imaging services, a ‘requester’ means a medical practitioner or, if the service is of a kind specified in regulations made under section 16B, a dental practitioner, a chiropractor, a physiotherapist, a podiatrist or an osteopath, or a person who employs or engages under a contract for services one of those people specified above. So attempts have been made with these new definitions to make sure that all people who might be involved in requesting these services are properly covered by the provision. A ‘provider’ of pathology service or diagnostic imaging service means: (a) a person who renders that kind of service; (b) a person who carries on a business of rendering that kind of service … I tell you what: from reading some of the section numbers that are in this bill, there must be a case to be made at some point, if ever there were some spare time, which I am sure the health department rarely finds, for doing some renumbering. The new section that I am going to talk about is proposed section 23DZZIF. I am sure even the tax act would be pushing it to find that sort of numbering. Nevertheless, that proposed section describes what is and what is not a permitted benefit. The new provisions are aimed at preventing the payment of inappropriate and unethical benefits in any form including money, property or services from a provider to a requester, either directly or indirectly, but are not intended to capture or prohibit legitimate commercial transactions. Amongst other matters, this proposed section deals with what is permitted in cases where a service requester, such as a GP, owns or part owns a pathology or diagnostic imaging service provider, or where a requester and a provider share premisessomething that of course is increasingly happening as we see the growth of superclinics and larger GP clinics as some of these services try to co-locate for the convenience of patients. New division 2 of part IIBA contains civil penalty provisions that are entirely new provisions for the Health Insurance Act and are imposed where a court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that a relevant person, a requester or provider, has contravened the provisions. The maximum penalties under the civil penalty provisions are 600 penalty units or $66,000 for an individual, including executive officers of corporations, and 6,000 penalty units or $660,000 for a corporation. Under division 2: A requester must not ask for or accept a pathology or diagnostic imaging service-related benefit (other than a permitted benefit) from a provider or a person connected to a provider. A provider must not offer or provide such a benefit to a requester or a person connected to a requester. A provider must not make a pathology or diagnostic imaging service-related threat to a requester or a person connected to a requester. The provisions may also be contravened by a requester or a provider if they know that a person connected to him or her has asked for, accepted, offered or provided such a benefit or made such a threat and they fail to report the person within 30 days to the Medicare Australia CEO. MAIN COMMITTEE The complexity of these provisions is designed to acknowledge one of the persistent allegations in this area-that it is not all in one direction: there are practices that people are concerned about by some who are running pathology services but there are also practices that people are concerned about by some who are requesting these services, such as GPs and others. So the redrafting and restructuring of this is aimed at covering all of those options. It may make tedious reading for those who are not involved with it, but it does seem to me to be an attempt to more thoroughly make sure that, when these practices do come to light, it is possible to effectively prosecute them. Ultimately, that is the only thing that is going to stop anyone who is determined to do the wrong thing. New division 3 of part IIBA contains the criminal offences. Many of the elements of the offences are similar to the civil penalty provisions, but it is necessary, of course, to prove beyond reasonable doubt certain levels of intention and/or knowledge on the part of persons involved in the making or receiving of requests or benefits, or the making of threats. The maximum penalty for a division 3 offence is five years imprisonment or 300 penalty units. Here is another good section. I am going to bore you, I am afraid, Mr Deputy Speaker, with a range of these. Under the new section 23DZZIQ there are two sets of offences-firstly, where a requester asks for or accepts a prohibited benefit, and, secondly, where a requester knows that another person has asked for or accepted a prohibited benefit and has not reported it to Medicare Australia. These offences are mirrored in the new section 23DZZIR, which deals with people who offer or provide the benefits. Section 23DZZIS provides that a person also commits an offence if they threaten a second person intending that that threat will induce a requestor of pathology or diagnostic imaging services to request services for a particular provider. Notably, this bill makes explicit reference to executive officer liability in a number of new provisions. The elements required for executive officer liability mirror those in other Commonwealth legislation, such as section 54B of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. Obviously, again, this is an attempt to make sure not just that it is the particular professionals who will be covered by this but that, if there are others involved in owning businesses that might participate in these sorts of activities, they also at the highest levels will be able to be pursued and prosecuted if they are behaving inappropriately. Items 39 to 84 of the bill amend various elements of part VB of the Health Insurance Act, dealing with the Medicare Participation Review Committee. Currently, in cases where persons have been convicted of Health Insurance Act pathology related offences or are considered to have contravened the prohibitions relating to diagnostic imaging services, the Medicare Participation Review Committee may take a range of actions, including making services provided by that person ineligible for Medicare payments. The bill amends part VB so that the jurisdiction of the committee applies on conviction of the new offences or a court order giving an order for civil penalties-obviously, again, just to expand the range of options that can be found if someone has been found to have behaved inappropriately. Item 85 inserts a new part VIA, which outlines some of the details about civil penalties, including Federal Court powers and clarifying the relationship between civil penalty proceedings and criminal proceedings. The bill makes a large number of consequential and other amendments arising from the introduction of the new regime, which you will be pleased to know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not propose to go through in any detail today. MAIN COMMITTEE Schedule1 also amends the Medicare Australia Act 1973 and the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986. The Medicare Australia Act contains certain powers that allow authorised officers to require the production of information or conduct searches where there are reasonable grounds to believe that Medicare related offences have been committed. Items 98 to 109 of schedule 1 amend the act for these powers to apply to situations where it is suspected that a civil penalty provision might have been contravened. Obviously, again, it is trying to get all of the changes in a row. If we get our definitions clear and the nature of the offences clear, we need to have the proper powers to be able to investigate as well. Schedule1 substitutes a new definition of ‘approved pathology practitioner’ in subsection 93E(9) of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act to reflect amendments to the Health Insurance Act. Schedule2 makes some minor procedural amendments to the regulations. According to the government, these changes have been the subject of extensive consultations with pathology providers, professional and peak industry groups, state and federal government agencies, and consumer groups. Certainly the gestation period of the bill has been a pretty extensive one, so we would expect that within that time that consultation has occurred. There are some media reports that suggest that the Australian Medical Association believes that there are already sufficient regulatory mechanisms in place to address inappropriate interactions between requesters and providers of pathology services. However, representatives of the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia and the Australian Association of Pathology Practices have expressed support for the measures contained in the bill. I understand from the reports and discussions that the AMA’s view is more that this is a belts-and-braces approach rather than one that is strictly necessary; however, the strong support from the others in the field makes it clear that there is acknowledgement that, if there are people doing the wrong thing, they need to be stopped-not only does it cost the government and the health budget a lot of money if there are abuses; it costs the rest of the profession some of their integrity. I am sure there is an interest to make sure that inappropriate practices are stamped out. In line with this stakeholder support, Labor support this legislation because we are confident that the new provisions will prove more effective than the current enforcement and offence provisions of the Health Insurance Act in tackling prohibited inducements and other relationships between requesters and providers of pathology services and diagnostic imaging services. We clearly understand that overservicing and prohibited practices in pathology and diagnostic imaging sectors-indeed, in any sector-serve to undermine the whole system and to cast a shadow over the good work done by the vast majority of providers who are doing the right thing. It is not fair that the majority of providers who are doing the right thing face commercial losses simply because they comply with the spirit of the legislation, while their competitors do not. Labor support legislative frameworks that encourage fair competition between providers of pathology and diagnostic imaging services on the basis of the quality of the services provided and the costs to patients, rather than inducements in other relationships. Performing unnecessary procedures is not just deceitful; it is wasteful and costly. It is costly to Medicare, it is costly to the broader health system and inevitably it is costly to the whole community. Labor are committed to the universal provision of quality health care for all Australians. Past Labor governments built Medicare, and Labor believe that Medicare should be retained, MAIN COMMITTEE defended and strengthened. Labor know that Medicare is the cornerstone of our health system. Labor obviously do not and cannot support the abuse of Medicare. We support this legislation because we believe that Medicare must be protected from inappropriate use by deceitful service providers. The major changes envisaged in this bill, in schedule 1, will take effect from 1 March 2008, some time out from today. The government has noted that this will allow stakeholders time to familiarise themselves with the changes and will aid in a smooth transition. If these problems have been going on for some time, there are many who would be impatient for those changes to be implemented immediately; however, it is understood that throughout the industry there are difficulties in ensuring that the transition happens smoothly and properly. That transition would have been a little smoother had the government already prepared regulations to accompany this new scheme. We do understand that, prior to the proposed commencement, the government has pledged to develop with stakeholders regulations that provide comprehensive details about specific elements of the reforms. As ever, it would have been helpful for all concerned, and particularly for us, if the government had been organised and interested enough to ensure that these details were available more broadly in time for the consideration of this bill. Notwithstanding this small shortcoming, Labor supports this bill and commends it to the House. ment (Inappropriate and Prohibited Practices and Other Measures) Bill 2007. This bill will ensure that a patient’s access to pathology and diagnostic imaging services is not clouded by considerations other than a clinical need. The bill will strengthen Medicare, and allow the government to deliver on its commitment to act on the recommendations of the Phillips Fox review of enforcement and offence provisions of the Health Insurance Act as they relate to the provision of pathology services under Medicare. Claims have been made, whether or not they are substantiated, that a minority of providers, particularly within the pathology industry, may make payments or other considerations so that practitioners will be more likely to refer their patients to them for service. This could, if it were true, lead to the ordering of excess services that may not be clinically necessary and may cause undue alarm and concern to patients about their health status. This perception by patients is of concern, and I believe this bill is a sensible way to overcome the potential of this issue arising. Clinical need should be the most important consideration in referring patients for tests to diagnose illness. Health, especially in rural and regional areas, has always been of great concern to me. I am pleased that this amending legislation will enforce penalties if this issue arises and medical practitioners are encouraged or induced by payments or other benefits to direct their patients to a particular provider. I feel confident that I have a very good relationship with medical service providers within the Riverina, particularly the diagnostic services and pathology laboratories. I believe that each and every one of them is dedicated to providing the best service, and at a minimal charge to the patients at most times. But if there are concerns, particularly in the patient arena, then this legislation offers great comfort to patients. Particularly when you note the difficult times that people in the Riverina are experiencing with the ongoing drought and the downturn in their employment opportunities because of it, to have to pay for services that may not be required is just another burden. It is an extraordinary strain on the household budgets of the MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Health Insurance Amendment Inappropriate And Prohibited Practices And Other Measures Bill 2007
201,Mrs Hull (Riverina) (10.23 Am),"TodayI rise to support the Health Insurance Amendmany people who have chronic and ongoing diseases and who require more frequent treatments or visits to pathology and diagnostic imaging facilities than the general public. I have great sympathy with the upsurge in the referral of patients, particularly to pathology and diagnostic imaging providers, by doctors. Consumer litigation has increased substantially in our modern age. If, as a doctor, I were in the position of diagnosing and treating a patient, first and foremost I would go to all lengths to ensure that the patient’s needs were addressed because doctors, specialists and others in the medical profession are dedicated to patient care above and beyond all. But underlying this there must be a certain feeling that, should you misdiagnose a patient for the lack of getting some other diagnostic tests done, now, more than ever before, there is the potential for a litigation case to be brought against you. It is a sad indictment on our community that we have become so focused on litigation and on making everybody personally responsible for outcomes that there is an underlying insecurity in many of the professions, not just the medical profession. I certainly feel that, in order to ensure that diagnostic facilities and pathology facilities are appropriately used clinically, there is a need to put in place comfort legislation such as this. The amending legislation has three aims. One is to prohibit certain practices relating to the rendering of pathology and diagnostic imaging services, including prohibiting inducements between requesters and providers of those services. When you go to a doctor and get a pathology service referral or a diagnostic imaging referral it is written out on a particular service provider’s letterhead. That may lead the patient to falsely assume that there is some type of connection between that doctor or that surgery and the provider of that service when that may not be the case. It certainly has led to some confusion when patients maybe feel that they have to attend this service provider in lieu of the service provider that they may be more comfortable with. But of course we know that this is not the case. Even if a request is written out on a service provider’s form, it can easily be taken to another service provider to fulfil the same tests-but sometimes the patient gets confused with that. Another part of this amendment will prevent payments for pathology and diagnostic imaging services that simply do not benefit patients. In addition, these amendments will encourage fair competition between the many providers of services on the basis of quality of services provided and cost to the patient. Referrals should be made in the best interest of the patient, and in most cases predominantly those are the circumstances. Medical tests can be daunting for people, as they can indicate a new illness or an extension of an existing illness that could be worsening and could have become more serious. Patients do not need the added stress of potentially being part of a non-permitted transaction through medical professionals and diagnostic providers who may do deals to ensure that referrals are made to a particular practice. The reforms are proposed to take effect from 1 March 2008, and the bill sets out new prohibitions relating to both pathology and diagnostic imaging services, as I have outlined. It would not be permitted for a commercial transaction between requestors and providers to be linked in any way to the number, type or value of the services requested. The provisions prohibit both requestors and providers from being involved in non-permitted transactions, including those that are channelled through third parties. These also include civil penalties where pathology or diagnostic imaging providers offer or provide non-permitted benefits or make MAIN COMMITTEE threats to requestors. I find it hard to believe that that could happen, but obviously there has been some view that this may be a practice in some areas. At no time do I think that the providers in my electorate are actually stooping to such a low level. I am very comforted that this bill will give them-and also the provider-the protection that they need. When some of these allegations may be made after this legislation is enacted, the providers and the referrals can clearly say, ‘That simply can’t be the case because there is legislation that prohibits that from happening.’ So everyone will be protected by the introduction of this legislation. Providers and requestors will also be held liable when non-permitted benefits are asked for, offered or exchanged or when threats are made by someone connected to them. The relationships covered will include relatives, partnerships and any other close financial relationship. The prohibitions are supported by penalties of up to $66,000 against individual requestors or providers or $660,000 for corporations. It is not possible to quantify the Medicare outlays that may be saved through these measures, but with Medicare outlays on pathology and diagnostic imaging running at around $3.2 billion a year, even if 0.5 per cent of the outlays was being saved by preventing inappropriate practices, this would mean a $16 million saving to the budget per year that could be applied to other very worthwhile and worthy health areas. Pathology and diagnostic imaging services, particularly in the Riverina, play a critical role in health care. In areas like the Riverina where sometimes services are few and far between, these services are almost an entire service of their own. The doctors-particularly in diagnostic imaging-play a critical role in early diagnosis and detection of breast cancer and many other cancers and many other forms of disease that can enable speedy treatment to take place for country people. I applaud doctors who have diagnostic facilities in those areas. It is very difficult to get a workforce of diagnostic imaging doctors in country areas. We face a dire shortage of them. In the Riverina, many of these doctors have been committed to our region over long periods but have felt for many reasons that they have had to move and relocate in Melbourne, Sydney or other areas. We are now forced to fly in many diagnostic doctors from Adelaide and other places in South Australia to provide these services. By no means do I underestimate the performance of the doctors involved in diagnostic imaging services and the critical role that they play in my electorate. I congratulate them on their dedication. It is all very well to have radiographers and people who conduct tests, but to have that diagnostic facility-doctors diagnosing and reading all of these results-is absolutely imperative. We need to ensure that these doctors are still settling in regional Australia and that we are not reduced to fly-in fly-out services. Pathology and imaging account for a significant amount of taxpayer funded outlays from the national health care budget. This is commensurate with the absolutely sensational diagnostic services that they provide. There are approximately 83 million Medicare funded pathology services such as X-ray, ultrasound, computer tomography, CTs and magnetic resonance imaging. MRIs are performed daily in my electorate. This expenditure equates to in excess of $3.2 billion, which represents approximately 30 per cent of the total Medicare outlay in 20052006. It is hoped that these changes will ensure that the small number-and I suspect that it is a very small number-of requesters and providers of diagnostic services who currently engage in inappropriate practices will cease doing so or be subject to significant penalties. If there is MAIN COMMITTEE any evidence that the provisions are not addressing such activities, the government will look at this in consultation with stakeholders further down the path. Also, criminal offence or civil penalty provisions can only be added by the passage of some additional legislation. I suspect that it will not be required and that we will find that this legislation will provide comfort and security to both the practitioner and the patient. As with tax avoidance legislation, we need to keep pace with any potential underhanded rorting whatsoever of the system. This is not picking on pathologists and radiologists or the doctors who refer to them; it is purely providing a support and safety network for the referral, the referrer and the referee. The legislation review process has taken four years and has involved close consultation with the professions and the related industries. The final shape of the bill has taken into account that a one-size-fits-all solution simply does not fit both the pathology and the radiology industries. The review of pathology enforcement and offence provisions included the preparation and dissemination of an issues and options paper back in January 2005. The paper was distributed for comment to all the relevant government agencies, the pathology providers, the pathology professionals, the peak industry organisations, the state and territory governments, the medical registration authorities and the peak consumer groups. Again, I wish to emphasise my support for the amendments in this bill because not only do they ensure that patient access to pathology and diagnostic imaging services is not clouded by considerations other than clinical needs but they also provide a security that will underpin the pathology and diagnostic imaging services. If there is some allegation that inappropriate practices are taking place due to some ill-informed or little understood way of how procedures should take place, then the provider can always refer back to this bill and say: ‘This simply is not happening. It cannot possibly happen because there is legislation and there are very appropriate fines that prevent such practices from occurring.’ So the integrity of the service provider is kept absolutely intact. I congratulate the minister on his cooperation in working with and involving all industries in the lead-up to the presentation of this bill. Again, I congratulate the industry on its cooperation with the department and the minister. The industry certainly was not dragged kicking and screaming to support this legislation. It understands the issues and perceptions that can arise. It is every bit as interested in ensuring integrity in our system as the government is interested in ensuring that the industry cannot possibly make any illegal use of the healthcare budget and that the healthcare budget is used only for its intended purposes. I commend the bill to the House. Ms HALL (Shortland) (10.41 am)-The Health Insurance Amendment (Inappropriate and Prohibited Practices and Other Measures) Bill 2007 is important legislation because it guarantees the integrity of the system and ensures that we get the best use of our health dollars. The bill amends the Health Insurance Act to replace existing provisions regarding the payment of benefits between providers and requesters of pathology and diagnostic imaging services with new provisions aimed at prohibiting certain practices in relation to rendering pathology and diagnostic imaging services, including prohibiting inducements and other relationships between requesters and providers of pathology services and diagnostic imaging services, preventing payment for pathology and diagnostic imaging services that do not benefit patients and encouraging fair competition between pathology and diagnostic imaging providers on the MAIN COMMITTEE basis of quality of service provided and cost to patients. These are very important issues. It is extremely important that the integrity of the system is guaranteed and that patients are not referred off for services that they do not need-that is contraindicated; it is against the best interests of those patients. Ensuring that the system is fair, that there is a level playing field, is vital. I note the recommendations of the review commissioned by the department of health and undertaken by Phillips Fox lawyers, which specifically examined the enforcement and offence provisions of the Health Insurance Act as they relate to the provision of pathology services under Medicare. The Phillips Fox review was a response to claims that a minority of providers-I emphasise here that it is a minority of providers; it is not widespread-particularly within the pathology industry, were providing payments or other inducements to practitioners so that practitioners would refer patients to them. The member for Riverina referred to service providers’ referral forms. Most doctors will fill out the referral form of a particular service provider. Doctors will refer a patient to a pathologist or a diagnostic imaging service that is appropriate for the test or service that their patient needs or, alternatively, one that is located in the vicinity of where they live or one that they can easily access. I do not see the fact that a doctor fills out a particular referral form to a particular pathologist or diagnostic image provider as the issue. The issue is where inappropriate inducements are offered. Whilst the Phillips Fox lawyer investigation did not go into this in detail, they said there was clear anecdotal evidence that it did occur and therefore it was very important that this issue be addressed. It is important to put on the record that for the 2005-06 year, there were 83 million Medicare funded pathology services performed, with approximately 10 million Australians accessing these services. During the same period, approximately 15 million diagnostic imaging services were performed. That is X-rays, ultrasounds, and MRIs, which benefited 6.5 million Australians. This equated to $3.2 billion. That is approximately 30 per cent of the total Medicare outlays in 2005-06. Therefore, it is imperative to ensure that the services that are paid for are appropriate services and that there is no inappropriate servicing prompted by providers paying inappropriate benefits to requesters. It has not been quantified, but the anecdotal evidence is there and it has been tagged at about $16 billion a year. This legislation will, I believe, remedy the situation. This legislation will ensure the integrity of the system. I probably should mention the kind of inducements that have been referred to anecdotally. They include things such as gifts, lump sum payments, providing staff to practices and inducements to encourage referrers to refer to particular services. I think one of the most important things for us as a society, when we are looking at the kinds of services that are prescribed and the kinds of services that patients have, is to know that those services are needed and that the integrity of the system is guaranteed. It is interesting to note that the interest groups have basically supported this. The AMA do not oppose the actual legislation although they have stated that they do think that there are currently sufficient regulatory mechanisms in place. The Chief Executive Officer of the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia, Dr Debra Graves, is reported as having argued that while the problem is not widespread, there are reports of a small number of practices that have not acted appropriately. It is this behaviour that the anti-rorting legislation will target. So MAIN COMMITTEE the pathologists themselves see that this is important legislation. It is important that it is supported. It is clear that the current legislation has proved ineffective in tackling this problem. That is why we need this new legislation and why all members in the parliament should support it. Persistent claims of overservicing and prohibited practices within the pathology and diagnostic imaging sectors undermine the integrity of the system and increase the cost of payments to that sector when scarce healthcare dollars could be used in other areas. On that point alone the legislation that we are debating today should be supported. These changes to the Health Insurance Act arise from several thorough reviews of the operation of Commonwealth legislation for pathology arrangements under Medicare and have been the subject of extensive consultation with pathology providers, professional and peak industry groups, state and federal government agencies, and consumer groups, so they have the support of people and organisations that are involved in the industry. We support this legislation because we are confident that the new provisions will be more effective than the current enforcement and offence provisions of the HIA in tackling the problem that has been outlined. There have been persistent reports of overservicing and prohibited practices in the pathology system and also in diagnostic imaging services and it is imperative that these things be removed. The overservicing in some cases, particularly when you are looking at people being overexposed to diagnostic imaging, can actually be harmful, so it is a health issue as well as a dollars and cents issue. As a person who is passionate about health and passionate about Australians getting the best quality health services available, I see that this legislation will lead towards that. I am totally committed to Medicare and see it as the cornerstone of our health system, and I see this as a way of strengthening Medicare and stopping some practices that could be undermining Medicare. I know it is important that we get the most we can out of the health dollar and I think that, if certain sectors are overservicing and inappropriately spending that health dollar, it is not in Medicare’s interests or the interests of the Australian people. All of us in this parliament should be committed to seeing that the health services Australians get are the health services they need and not health services that are being driven by alternative mechanisms. I am very happy to support this legislation. Legislation like this is definitely in the interests of Medicare and in the interests of the Australian people. and Prohibited Practices and Other Measures) Bill 2007 has been approached in a very unusual way. We have in the explanatory memorandum the setting out of options and choices available to the government in the pathology area. Then we have the pros and cons: doing nothing, minor fiddling and redrafting proposals, which are the key options. They are set out in tabular form, together with the impact on Commonwealth, state and other authorities. And then, by a process of deduction, the explanatory memorandum takes the reader through the process to finally announcing the government’s decision, which is to wipe out sections of the act and redraft and reattempt the management of this area. In early 2000, the Commonwealth initiated a review of Commonwealth legislation for pathology arrangements under Medicare. That was supposed to report back in December 2000. The problem with some of these things is that, when you send them off to an expert group, they can have a life of their own. This one certainly did. It was supposed to take them nine MAIN COMMITTEE",184,Health Insurance Amendment Inappropriate And Prohibited Practices And Other Measures Bill 2007
202,Mr Cadman (Mitchell) (10.54 Am),"The Health Insurance Amendment (Inappropriatemonths to meet that December deadline; it took them two years and nine months. They finished the job in December 2002. The review concluded that the legislative arrangements for regulating pathology services needed to be updated and streamlined because they wanted to have bribery and prohibited offences provisions in the Health Insurance Act. As a result, the Commonwealth commissioned Phillips Fox to evaluate the effectiveness of the current enforcement, to identify the compliance arrangements that also apply to providers of pathology services, to identify different options for compliance regimes and to evaluate each of the identified options. That provision has been moved into the explanatory memorandum, which really runs the argument of the ‘do nothing’ proposal. OptionB is to amend the existing provisions, and option C is to repeal and replace the existing provisions. What the government wanted to achieve with this was to reduce the inappropriate expenditure for pathology and diagnostic imaging services provided under the MBS and to ensure that competition between providers of pathology and diagnostic imaging services was based on quality of service and cost to patients and not skewed in favour of those who provided the benefits to requesters of pathology and diagnostic imaging services. They were saying that the radiologists and radiographers are the providers of the service and so this service should not be set up to suit them but be set up on the basis of quality of service and cost to patients. That requirement of the government was a very sensible approach. In order to achieve these objectives, the government decided it would revise the existing provisions to clarify the intention of the current prohibitions and it would extend the current provisions to include requesters of pathology and diagnostic imaging services. So, for the first time, the requesters of pathology were going to be included in the group that must comply with some sort of regime of integrity so that you would not have anybody through the back door requiring more requests of diagnostic imaging and pathology services than was sensible. We went through this at the beginning of Medibank. The case of Dr Geoffrey Edelsten was notorious. As the House may remember, he had a regime of his own. My office, incidentally, was right next-door to his first surgery. There were deep pink carpets, a grand piano was played day and night for those who visited, there was a playground for the children and there were all of these very salubrioushad a pink helicopter and a lovely wife or girlfriend-I do not know which. what has been dealt with here in a more refined way. The House is looking at a refining of the limitations that should be put on professionals in the way in which $1.6 billion of Commonwealth funds is spent. It is a large amount of money and it is open to abuse, so the Commonwealth looked at the various options. This legislation is a revamp of what is currently in place. The key changes that the House is looking at include extending the prohibitions to include requesters of pathology and diagnostic imaging services; strengthening the prohibition on arm’s length distancing between pathology and diagnostic imaging providers and requesters through the use of family, commercial and/or corporate arrangements-that is, company MAIN COMMITTEE",189,Health Insurance Amendment Inappropriate And Prohibited Practices And Other Measures Bill 2007

206,Mr Cadman,"Leanne-that is right. Those circumstances bring back to my memorystructures or trusts, which link people together in a way which is poor corporate practice if one wants to achieve openness and clarity; and the broadening of definitions that could be interpreted as an inducement. The legislation also looks at the introduction of mechanisms to ensure legitimate commercial transactions between pathology and diagnostic imaging providers and requesters; the creation of an expanded range of penalties to those that are relevant at the current time; the incorporation of Crown activities, such as those involving MBS billing by state and territory health authorities within the scope of the provision-gathering in everybody so there is no escape hole from the net that is cast over this provision-and the introduction of a ministerial exemption capacity within the legislation to enable sufficient flexibility so as to avoid unintended consequences. That is another sensible let-out for something that the community would regard as desirable, which allows the minister to declare that something should happen. Ministers are appointed to make decisions and they should be allowed to do so. I think that is a very sensible discretion for the minister. Groups that were consulted and considered were the Australian government, the states and territories, pathology providers, diagnostic imaging service providers, requesters of pathology and diagnostic imaging services, and consumers. It covers a multiplicity of professions. It was a thorough process and we now have the legislation. I endorse the legislation. I am particularly enthralled by the way in which the logic is argued. The clarity of the decision and the processes used to reach these conclusions are set out for an inexperienced reader. It should allow the medical profession and their financial and corporate advisers to understand the reasons for the government’s decision. It should allow them to be able to chart a course of practice and conduct which is beyond question and which will clearly achieve the government’s objectives-that is, to demonstrate quite openly and transparently that there is no link between the request for these pathology and diagnostic imaging services that is anything but appropriate and proper in the circumstances. One of the complaints I hear from practitioners is that it is easy for a young or busy doctor to send somebody off to get everything done and, in some instances, just cherry pick the stuff that comes back that may be applicable to that person, whether they need to or not. Is it being super careful? Yes. Do we like medicos to be super careful? Yes, we do, but we also expect them to use some professional judgement gained by experience and through their knowledge, education and training. I believe this prohibition and its application, together with the penalties, is a very fine piece of work. Being a member of the government members’ health committee, I commend the minister and those involved with him for the way in which this legislation has been developed. I think the inquiry two years ago was a bit of a mistake or rather unfortunate because the community could have benefited from this legislation then. I commend the bill to the House. am)-Thank you to all of the members who have spoken on the Health Insurance Amendment (Inappropriate and Prohibited Practices and Other Measures) Bill 2007, both opposition and government-the members for Gellibrand, Riverina, Shortland and Mitchell.

207,Mr Lindsay (Herbert,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (11.04tic imaging services funded under Medicare. There is strong public interest, particularly taxpayer interest, in the provisions in this bill before the parliament today. The bill amends the act to more clearly express the government’s intention to prevent inducements between providers and requesters of pathology and diagnostic imaging services. From a policy perspective, it moves to safeguard the public interest and protect Medicare from those very few people who wish to put greed ahead of good practice. We want to ensure that pathology and diagnostic services are referred and provided only in the best clinical interests of patients. We want to ensure that access to Medicare in these areas is not a licence to rort the system for personal or corporate gain. I stress, though, that, in the view of the government, the professions and industries of pathology and radiology do not have widespread problems in this regard, but we all agree that public confidence demands prudence and the ability to take effective action against those who let the whole of the community down by their wrong and unethical actions. The amendments before the parliament have three main aims: first, to prohibit inappropriate practices relating to the rendering of pathology and diagnostic imaging services, including prohibiting inducements between requesters and providers of those services; second, to prevent payments for pathology and diagnostic imaging services that do not benefit patients; and, third, to encourage fair competition between providers of those services on the basis of the quality of services and their cost to patients. The revised provisions define commercial relationships that are permitted between those who can request Medicare funded pathology and diagnostic imaging services and those who provide those services. They prohibit requesters and providers from being involved in nonpermitted transactions, including those that are channelled through third parties. In other words, they give the legislation compliance and enforcement teeth that it has never had before. The provisions include civil penalties where pathology and diagnostic imaging providers offer or provide non-permitted benefits or make threats to requesters. The bill also prevents requesters from asking for or accepting non-permitted benefits from providers. Similar exchanges of benefits or threats will represent a criminal offence subject to a penalty of up to five years imprisonment where it can be shown that the person intended to induce the requester to request services from a particular provider. Some stakeholders have raised concerns that the legislation may contain unintended loopholes allowing some inappropriate practices to continue. The government are confident that the legislation and the regulations that will underpin its implementation will address the substance of these concerns. However, we are still considering relevant stakeholders, and the government reserve the right to introduce amendments in the Senate if necessary. These reforms will take effect from 1 March 2008. This will allow everyone to familiarise themselves with the changes and aid a smooth transition to new ways of doing things. I note that the shadow minister, the member for Gellibrand, made some criticisms of the time taken to conduct these reviews and make consequent legislative changes. As she would understand, this is a highly delicate and sensitive issue for practitioners and the industries in which they work. It was definitely, in the government’s view, a matter of ‘hastening slowly’ and working with the profession and industry, as we share a common interest in stamping out practices when they occur that affect the reputations of all of us. The best result is not a MAIN COMMITTEE rushed result. For the same reasons, the government decided to pass this legislation before finalising the regulations to give it full effect. We depend on the deep specialist and corporate knowledge of the industry and profession to implement these changes. By passing this legislation we are giving them assurances about the boundaries of the detailed regulation so that they can work with us with confidence. Therefore, the government undertake to work closely with stakeholders during the development of the regulations to ensure that they do not produce any unintended consequences and so they reflect best professional and corporate practice. We will also ensure that the changes are well understood by those who may be affected. In closing, I would like to thank both government speakers and members of the opposition who have supported this bill. That support is very much appreciated. On behalf of the government, I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. BILL 2007 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 March, on motion by Mr Billson: That this bill be now read a second time. the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007. The bill amends the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Income Tax Assessment Act. There are a range of amendments principally to the VEA to formalise current practice and policy, better align the VEA with the Social Security Act, correct unintended and unfair consequences of the drafting of veterans affairs legislation and improve the department’s administration. These amendments touch upon the income and assets test, the tax treatment of veterans pensions and assets, bereavement payments and eligibility criteria for assistance and compensation. These amendments are mostly of a technical and housekeeping nature. I will go to the specifics of some of the amendments for the benefit of the House. The amendments to the Veterans’ Entitlements Act cover issues such as the written notification of income support pensions decisions. This will require the Repatriation Commission to provide written notification of its decisions in relation to a number of claims and other matters, in line with current practice, and make a written record of that determination, setting out its findings on questions of fact, evidence and reasons for its determination. The commission will also be required by law to provide a copy of the decision, findings and rights of appeal to the claimant, except where it is of the opinion that the information is of a confidential nature. In addition, the family assistance payments will ensure that additional one-off payments of family assistance under the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families-One-off Payments) Act 2004 are not counted as income under the act. This will bring the VEA into line with the Social Security Act, which exempts one-off payments to families from the income test. It will also ensure that the disposal of assets provisions do not apply MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Health Insurance Amendment Inappropriate And Prohibited Practices And Other Measures Bill 2007
208,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (11.11 Am),"I commence by saying that the Labor Party supportswhere the assets’ disposition took place more than five years before the person or the person’s partner became eligible to receive a service pension or income support supplement, or less than five years before the person or person’s partner became eligible and before the time that the disposer could reasonably have expected that the person or person’s partner would become eligible to receive a service pension or income support supplement. It will also expand the definition of compensation-affected payment to include supplementary benefits so that, in cases of overpayment, supplementary payments will be recoverable where primary payments are recoverable, in line with the provisions of the Social Security Act. The bill will amend the bereavement payment provisions to ensure that, where a deceased person’s payments include the Defence Force income support allowance, the bereavement payment provided to the surviving partner or carer also includes that allowance. It will also amend the income and assets test for the service pension and income support supplement so that, where an asset is disposed of for less than its full value and adequate consideration is later received, the application of the deprivation provision can be cancelled or disregarded. It will also expand access to rent assistance for special rate disability pension recipients to amend an unintended provision of the VEA that precludes access to some SRDP recipients on a reduced rate due to compensation income from another source for the same injury or illness. Under schedule 2 there are a range of amendments to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. The bill will amend the MRCA to clarify and broaden the definition of service injury or disease to include those injuries or diseases contracted or aggravated as a consequence of medical treatment for an earlier service injury or disease. The schedule will also amend the onus of proof provisions of the MRCA to cover both persons claiming for the acceptance of liability and persons claiming for compensation. This will apply to an injury sustained or disease contracted and to injuries or diseases aggravated before, on or after the commencement of this item, from 1 July 2004. Further amendments, which relate to tidying the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2004, reflect earlier amendments to the VEA. The bill will also explicitly list the income support supplement as a payment that is exempted from the requirement in the Income Tax Assessment Act to provide a tax file number, and it will also clarify the taxable status of the Defence Force income support allowance payments in line with the tax treatment of the payment that it substitutes, such as the basic rate component of the ordinary age pension or the disability support pension. Thus the DFISA payment will be tax exempt in respect of those components of the payment for which the age pension payment is also tax exempt under the ITAA. As I said, the act is largely administrative, of minor note, but is important for ensuring we have an effective operating system and administration which provide for the needs of the veterans community. We must make sure that, through those processes, we have a system which looks after those who have served our country so well. In that context, it is an opportunity to also make some comments regarding the system overall, particularly departmental administration issues. One issue that concerns me greatly is the time it has taken the Department of Veterans’ Affairs to process claims. The 2005-06 annual report for the Department of Veterans’ Affairs revealed a dramatic increase in the time it takes to process veterans claims, particularly those relating to injury claims. The time taken to process a primary compensation claim under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act is recorded as 106 MAIN COMMITTEE days, while the target is 75 days. That is a 40 per cent increase over the department’s target. The mean time taken to process primary injury claims under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act ballooned from 122 days in 2004-05 to 181 days in 2005-06. This is a 48 per cent increase since 2004-05. The mean time taken to process primary injury claims under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act has blown out from 90 days to 146 days, up 62 per cent since 2004-05. The time taken to process new impairment claims under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act has dramatically ballooned from 26 days to 130 days-up 400 per cent since 2004-05. These figures are part of an overall picture that is not very pretty. The latest figures that I have been able to obtain from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs have revealed that 4,570 claims have exceeded the average time taken to process a claim. This backlog included 2,583 claims for a disability pension, 956 claims for compensation under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and 545 claims for compensation under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. The high number of overdue veterans claims comes after the department revealed that they had been forced over the last two financial years to implement a net national reduction of 12.5 per cent in staff allocated to process compensation claims under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. The department have said that the reduction of staffing was made in order to meet the government’s budget allocations. The minister should not be cutting staff or resources to his department when they are failing to meet their current obligations. One thing that must be understood, and understood clearly, is that veterans and ex-service personnel are often at their most vulnerable during the claims process. Emotionally and physically the process can be very draining for people. Veterans and ex-service personnel deserve more. They deserve respect and a timely consideration of their claims rather than a long and drawn-out process. It is the government’s responsibility to ensure that this happens. We are talking about people who served our country, and they deserve a lot better service than what they are getting from the Howard government. I know in response to this-because I have raised these issues in the past-that the minister makes the point that through flexible administration within the department they have been able to address some of these issues. We are still to see the evidence of that. He also makes the point that what happens on some occasions is that, effectively, because of the time taken for claimants to respond with paperwork et cetera and because the department does do not have a stop-the-clock system, this leads to an appearance of greater blow-outs in the time taken for claims to be considered than is actually the case. Nonetheless, there is absolutely no doubt that there is still an issue that needs to be addressed and this government has to do something more about it. When we go to that question about staffing in relation to the department and the administration of the department, in last night’s budget it was revealed that the government intends to reduce the department’s average staffing level again for the third budget in a row. If we go back through that time, average staffing levels in 2005-06 were 2,463 actual, down 24 from the year before, and in 2006-07 were 2,320 actual, down 143 from the year before. The estimate as proposed in 2007-08 appears to be a cut to 2,289, down some 31. We do not know where those positions are being taken from. We are not sure. We do not have those details yet. But we will be trying to seek some further breakdown through estimates and other processes. MAIN COMMITTEE I think we have to be really concerned that, with these problems identified in the annual report of the department, there are issues there which, frankly, need to be looked at. When we are still cutting staffing in a department who have a very important role to play in ensuring that veterans get a fair go, we have to think about whether in fact that is a good thing. I note the figures for the department are certainly well down from when you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, were the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs some years ago. It would also be remiss of me, given last night’s events, not to talk briefly about some of the other issues which have come up in veterans affairs in recent times relating to benefits and administration and which were dealt with to some extent in last night’s budget. I will be saying more this afternoon in the main chamber when the legislation dealing specifically with some of these items is considered, but I will take the opportunity to mention them briefly now. I make it very clear that Labor welcomes the announcement of a $25,000 one-off ex gratia payment for Australian former prisoners of war in Europe or their surviving widows. These prisoners in fact missed out on the earlier decisions some years ago, which meant that prisoners of war of Japan and then later Korea received that payment. Certainly, we welcome on this occasion that matter being dealt with. I also congratulate the government on moving on the issue of increasing funeral benefits for eligible veterans under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, doubling the benefit from $1,000 to $2,000. This has been a long standing concern within the veterans area and is certainly a step in the right direction. It does not take into account fully what veterans under MRCA have available to them, but it is certainly an issue that needs to be dealt with, to a degree, and I congratulate the government on doing that. It is good that the government has recognised the fact that special intermediate rate disability pensions have been eroded dramatically over the last 10 years in particular, but I also make it very clear that, although there has been a catch-up payment out of this budget, that catch-up payment does not deal with the complete erosion that has occurred over that 10-year period. Nor does it deal with the central issue of indexation, which has been the issue the veterans community has been concerned about right the way through that period. I know the debate regarding the formula has been used as a justification for not acting on this matter over the years. I make it very clear that Labor support the catch-up payment that has been announced and will endorse that without any problem whatsoever, because we can see that there is a need for it to occur. But our commitment to implement indexation on a full basis which was made some days ago, prior to the budget, is still in place. We will do that after the next election. We will do it as a result of our first budget after the next election at the first indexation point post that budget, which will be September 2008. In those circumstances, we want to make sure that TPIs and other severely disabled veterans are not put in a situation where every several years-every budget before an electionthey have to come along cap in hand trying to catch up that which they have lost due to the erosion of their benefit with respect to community standards, because certainly that is what this payment is about. It does not address all of it, but the government’s announcement is certainly the first catch-up payment over the last decade that, it can be argued, seeks to address the indexation issue. The only other catch-up payment that was made was directly in relation to the costs of implementation of the GST. So, yes, it is long overdue. It is short of what it probably should have been and definitely does not address the central issue which is, as of MAIN COMMITTEE two months time when this payment starts to be made, that the erosion will continue. That is the matter that the veterans community has been saying consistently needs to be addressed with respect to this issue. I will make a couple of brief points about the budget. To ensure that veterans are not disadvantaged in any way, Labor will closely monitor the Howard government’s announcements of increased compliance measures and the potential savings arising from the areas of disability pensions, medications and health treatments. We are awaiting more detail. On the face of it, the initiatives appear to be worthwhile. We need to make sure that we do not disadvantage the veterans community-which, in some respects, is quite fragile-in order to drive savings. That would not be a good idea, and it would strike at the heart of a system that is compassionate and ensures that our ex-service people and veterans get a fair go. I will have more to say about those issues this afternoon in the other place. Labor supports the bill before the chamber, and I wish it a quick and speedy passage through to the other place. Its implementation will assist with the overall administration of the entitlements for veterans. I commend the bill to the House. lating to veterans affairs. I thank the member for Bruce for his generous observations-which is often the case as the veterans area of public policy is a fairly non-partisan one. Both sides of politics rightly appreciate that we could not be the sixth-oldest continuous democracy in the world had it not been for those who were prepared to serve our country at times of warindeed, at times of peace-and to put on the uniform, which is something many of my generation have not done. I note that the member for Cowan will speak after me. It is most certainly something that he did. As a generation that simply inherited their good work, I pay tribute always to those who have served our country. I will remark a little further on a couple of aspects. I recently returned from visiting some of our contemporary men and women in the ADF who are at work with the Royal Australian Air Force based in the gulf and with the Royal Australian Navy based on the HMAS Toowoomba. They are working in the northern part of the Arabian Gulf. The work they are doing there keeps alive the tradition of many generations of veterans. Australian servicemen and servicewomen have always gone out to make friends, even in the midst of the worse of conflicts. The men and women serving in our ADF today are keeping that tradition alive, and I simply say that everybody in this place-indeed, all around Australia-has a great reason to be very proud of the men and women of our Defence Force who are right now making friends in the gulf. I have a story to illustrate that. A chap out of Brisbane-a lieutenant in the Navy who is involved in interdiction parties as part of securing assets belonging to the Iraqi people in the northern gulf and who boards a variety of fishing vessels and large freighter vessels-rang his wife, as he is allowed to do these days, and said, ‘I want to seal a deal; I want to make friends wherever I go.’ She sent up a carton of clip-on koalas and, now, every skipper on small fishing dhows or large international freighters gets a little clip-on koala every time the Aussies come on board. I use that story to illustrate the debt that we owe our veterans, the way the men and women of today’s Defence Force are continuing that good work and the reputation we have earned, everywhere we have gone, of being decent and honourable. In the worse of conflicts, in the height of battle-or in times between battles-Australian service people have MAIN COMMITTEE",193,Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment 2007 Measures No 1
209,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (11.26 Am),"I am very pleased to speak on any matter realways gone out to do the very best by those they are there to help and to work with. I am therefore very happy to support the measures contained in the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007. The member for Bruce, as the opposition spokesperson for veterans affairs, highlighted a number of matters contained in last night’s budget. I do not wish to labour this for too long, but, like him, I welcome the recognition that prisoners of war in the European theatre of the Second World War were not the subject of Hogan’s Heroes type treatment. Any time that someone is held captive by an opposing force is a dreadful time. In the very rich environment that we have in this country today-a result of the government’s strong economic record but mainly because of the passion and ability of people in business to create wealth-we must go out of our way to distribute that wealth to those sorts of people. SoI am pleased about that. Also, the doubling of funerals benefits for veterans is long overdue. I am sure that the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs will address the TPI and disabled matters that the member for Bruce raised, but it is worth saying that last night’s budget delivered a special rate disability pension increase of $50 per fortnight and an intermediate rate pension increase of $25 per fortnight. Those with disabilities and infirmities as a result of war are never adequately compensated, but the government has stepped in the right direction with regard to that. As you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, would know because of your strong passion for the veteran community-not just when you were the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs but consistently during your time in this place-the Clarke review looked very closely at whether or not the special rate pension should be considered. The government is always willing to take advice from the veteran community in these matters. I do not think that we can ever compensate veterans enough for what they go through, but we should always pay them a debt of gratitude. Before dealing with the detail of the bill, I want to record my enormous lamentation. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you would have met this gentleman. Stan Crisp BEM-British Empire Medal-the Secretary of the Yeronga-Dutton Park RSL for many years and the receiver of the Centenary Medal, sadly passed away in the worse possible way. Sadly, in this country veterans die every day, but Stan was a hero at war, a hero in peace and a great worker in our community. His funeral is tomorrow. We did not see him at Ekibin Memorial Park or Gair Park this year-two events that the Yeronga-Dutton Park RSL organises. Stan lost his battle with cancer, which came upon him suddenly, but he lived to be a good age and worked very strongly in our community. He told me years ago, ‘Go and get a bit of navy in you, son.’ The main reason I was happy to visit the troops on HMAS Toowoomba, as I said at the Ekibin Memorial Park ANZAC Day service, was Stan Crisp’s urging. Stan, thank you. We are going to miss you, mate. Thanks for everything that you did. This bill is going to make a number of technical changes to the way the Veterans’ Entitlements Act and the compensation acts work. The definition of ‘compensation affected pension’ will be amended so that the telephone allowance, the advanced pharmaceutical allowance and the education entry payment, when paid to certain service pensioners and income support pension recipients, are included in the compensation recovery provisions within the act. This will ensure that any payments that have been made during a compensation preclusion period are recoverable under the compensation recovery provisions. Currently these payments are recovered directly from the pensioner separately to any overpayments, and we are making a change there. The change will have little impact on the recovery provisions, but will obviMAIN COMMITTEE ously deliver a far better service to the veteran community and also remove the indignity of the recovery process. Equally, we are going to insert written notification requirements. There is not currently a legislative requirement. There are procedural guidelines which the Department of Veterans’ Affairs follows which require the provision of these notifications. These amendments will ensure that pensioners are notified of any determinations regarding their income support entitlements. Again this will ensure that there is dignity through the process. There are amendments concerning the receipt or return of adequate consideration of a deprived asset to promote greater fairness. The amendments remove the requirement for an asset to be double counted. I mean no offence to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs folks who are here, but I find it strange that a lot of government departments are forever labouring our aged population, the older members of our population, with requirements to report things. I am not making policy on the run, but I suspect that, if you paid everybody above a certain age a pension and let the tax system sort it out, you could remove a whole pile of bureaucracy and reduce the impact on a lot of everyday people. I do not know why the oldest in our community are always being impacted upon. I welcome this particular legislation because it also says to veterans: ‘We’re not going to impact upon you as much as we might have in the past by these sorts of procedures. In fact we are going to give you greater dignity by removing some of the inconsistency between the Veterans’ Entitlements Act and social security law, for instance.’ That is certainly the case in some areas in the way this particular legislation will operate. There are changes regarding the bereavement payment for carer payment recipients under social security law that relate to the Defence Force income support allowance. It is intended to put social security income support recipients in the same position as they would be if their disability pension was regarded as exempt income. Including DFISA in the bereavement payment for carers will certainly achieve that intention. There are various other changes, including rent assistance allowance for those eligible for family tax benefit and restoring a legislative base for paying rent assistance under the VEA to income support pensioners who are not eligible for family tax benefit. DVA have always paid rent assistance within the spirit of the intention of that legislation-that is, to income support pensioners. We are making these sorts of changes and these sorts of provisions to ensure that our veterans community is better served. I do not disagree with the aspirations of the member for Bruce to do more. He has to work very hard as the shadow minister for veterans’ affairs because the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, the Hon. Bruce Billson, works very hard. He is very enthusiastic and a bit of a Peter Pan in that I do not think he ever wants to grow old-a bit like the Minister for Ageing, reallyand he embraces our veterans community. He listens to them and offers them respect-lest we ever forget the effort that veterans of the distant past, of the recent past and, indeed, of today have made for this country. I do not think we can ever do enough to repay that debt, their efforts on our behalf, but we must always be looking for new ways to serve them as they have served us. I commend this legislation to the House. Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007 go in some part to MAIN COMMITTEE",197,Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment 2007 Measures No 1
210,Mr Edwards (Cowan) (11.37 Am),"The issues I want to talk about in relation to thethe administration of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. My comments will also touch on the issue raised by the previous speaker about the fact that some people have to jump through hoops for a lot of government departments. I want to talk about some of the problems arising in the veterans community because of the multitude of agencies they have to confront. I want to begin by referring to an article in the Daily Telegraph written by Ian McPhedran, a person who takes a strong interest in defence and veterans issues. This article was published on 2 May. I am not going to quote it all, but I want to quote some of it. The article begins by saying: According to Veterans Affairs Minister Bruce Billson and some self-proclaimed armchair experts, there is an “industry” feeding off mentally-ill Australian war veterans. This is a bit rich at a time when the Department of Veterans Affairs is spending record amounts of taxpayer dollars fighting the compensation claims of veterans. The article goes on to say: Even more disturbing is the fact that Mr Billson jumped on the bandwagon. Fresh from crying crocodile tears for veterans on ABC TV, Mr Billson whinged about aggressive legal firms sourcing potential veteran clients. Just so the facts don’t get in the way of a good story, Mr Billson would also know that legal firms have opted out of veterans work because they can’t afford the pro-bono effort required to combat a litigious Department of Veterans Affairs with a bottomless bucket of taxpayer dollars. That department spent $5 million on private lawyers two years ago to fight veterans in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and has devoted $600,000 to a pilot program for using private law firms inside the DVA. I also keep a fairly close eye on the emails that fly around the veteran community. A bloke that I have had a bit to do with over the years and for whom I have a lot of respect recently sent some emails to the minister and received a response from him. This is Normie Rowe, who is a very high-profile and well-known veteran. In one of the emails, Normie wrote: But you know Bruce comparing our repat system with others doesn’t do it for me, what would do it for me is if instead of trying to find ways of winding it down, Government saw it as important to proactively look for ways of making compensation accessible to those who deserve it. Get rid of Writeways, they just muddy the water, and have access to files and documents a private company shouldn’t have access to and that don’t even have anything to do with the matter they are supposed to be “researching”. And then it would be a great step forward [if] Veterans were treated the same way upon return as they are sucked up to when they are sent off to war. There is another email from Normie that I want to quote in part because it is pertinent to what I say here. He wrote: ... but if while I’m still alive diggers who deserve to be looked after are looked after, and don’t have to fight for justice until they commit suicide, then I’ll vote for and encourage others to vote for the party/ies who will save those lives. And will justly compensate diggers not sell them out. Those comments lead into what I want to talk about today, which also includes the impact on veterans who have to deal with multi-agencies. I refer to a letter which is part of a report from a consulting psychiatrist. They were asked to do a report on a veteran who had returned from Afghanistan, who had been discharged from the Army and who has tragically committed suicide. MAIN COMMITTEE In quoting from this report I call on the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs to look at their administration and at the way they are dealing with young men and women. It really worries me, as a veteran, that within the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, within Defence, within government and within this parliament there appears to be a complete lack of understanding of post-traumatic stress, a complete lack of understanding of the impact on young men and women of the conditions they confront in a theatre of war and a complete lack of understanding of the trauma and the memory that those young men and women bring home with them. Trauma does not come about only as a result of action or confrontation with the enemy; it can come about from a whole range of things. It can come about from having to be constantly prepared, constantly on edge, for combat. It can come about from being constantly on the alert, constantly aware of what is happening around you and constantly prepared to immediately defend yourself. Fear and the concept of fear have a lot to do with post-traumatic stress disorder. In my view, it is not just about the actual combat. Perhaps it will become more apparent as I quote from the letter. The psychiatrist, in his general comments about the young man whom he had been asked to assess, wrote: Although somewhat better rapport was established toward the end of the interviewhewas clearly reluctant to volunteer information during the assessment. Part of this appeared to be based on anger, frustration and irritation at repeated medical assessments and interviews, part I think is related to significant residual depression and anxiety symptoms in an individual who has been severely traumatised by his past experiences. … … … It does appear that the diagnosis that led to his discharge on medical grounds was Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It also appears that, in parallel with this diagnosishehas experienced significant depressive symptoms with suicidal ideation at various points. A third medical condition that is referred to is the presence of Panic Disorder. The psychiatrist says: [He] currently feels unable to work. His reasons include an absence of motivation and drive, fear in some situations, his concerns over the impact of a “stress load” and his “state of mind”. It was difficult to obtain more detail than the above and he responded with “don’t know” to a number of specific questions. … … … He also complains of constant fatigue, marked irritability and a whole range of anxiety symptoms including dread, fear, apprehension and marked avoidance. The vast majority of these experiences are trigger dependent. I want to come back to ‘trigger dependent’. The psychiatrist goes on: Certain smells and noise can trigger these immediately. They are of a fluctuating pattern. He also describes sustained chronic suicidal ideation. He is clear that he has no current intent or plan and feels in control of his self-harm thinking. He also reports a reduction in concentration and attention which he feels then impacts on his short-term memory, which he describes as being reduced. He also reports day/night reversal of his sleeping pattern, preferring to sleep during the day and being awake at night. In terms of his mental state assessment, based on this history and examinationMAIN COMMITTEE heappeared as ayoungindividual who looked his age and was neatly dressed and well groomed. The assessment was difficult because of his reluctance to speak spontaneously and disclose personal information ... My assessment was that this difficulty in rapport was not because he was being difficult and deliberately withholding information. Rather, it was because of understandable frustration at having to repeat this process again, on a background of ongoing depressive and anxiety symptoms, many of which are still troubling him at this stage. In summaryhepresents as ayoung manin a supportive relationship with a diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, depressive symptoms, Panic Disorder and stomach pain of unknown aetiology ... In terms of his fitness for work, at present he is unfit for full-time work or part-time work of any nature. This is because, in addition to significant biological symptoms of depression and anxiety, he continues to have suicidal ideation which is chronic and sustained. It is unlikely that he will return to full-time work or part-time work until these symptoms have ameliorated. The prescribed impairment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is an appropriate description of his retiring impairment. In addition to this however, the presence of depressive symptoms, Panic Disorder and chronic suicidal ideation are also significant impairments. The consulting psychiatrist went on to say this: My current opinion is thatheis unable to perform any of these roles given his current mood and mental state. This is because his depressive and anxiety symptoms are still severe. In addition, his chronic suicidal ideation would render the completion of tasks under these roles unlikely. Furthermore, if he attempts to fulfil these roles the potential stress associated with this attempt may exacerbate his existing depressive symptoms and put him at higher risk of suicide. Any veteran who has gone through the system, through the mill, and has had to jump through hoops and over obstacles will relate intimately to what I have just read into the Hansard because they know as veterans; they have had to do it themselves and they have had to confront these issues. I spoke about how the vast majority of these experiences are ‘trigger dependent’. I know things about post-traumatic stress disorder and I am no expert. I worked in the Vietnam veterans counselling service when we set it up in Perth. I have spoken to many veterans over many years. I am no expert on post-traumatic stress disorder but I know that a veteran can be perfectly fine for a period of time, then something will happen, a trigger will be pulled somewhere, and the veteran will fall into the worse patterns of post-traumatic stress disorder. When veterans are forced to deal with multiagencies it is no wonder that their situation, their symptoms and their general health can deteriorate. It certainly happened in this case and, unfortunately, the suicide of this young man was not in isolation. One veterans organisation MAIN COMMITTEE tells me that in the last 12 or 18 months or so there have been five suicides that it is aware of. All were people who were dealing with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. For younger veterans, their dealings with the department are not made easier by having to deal with multiagencies. It is something that the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, the government and the minister must deal with. They must look at the situation which confronts the digger after they have been to war, been deployed and come home and after they have to deal with these issues. This young man that I have spoken about was not put in the T&PI. They did not recognise the extent of his post-traumatic stress disorder. They put him in what is known as a T&TI, temporarily and totally incapacitated, which meant that the onus would have been on him to continue to fight the department, continue to go through assessment and continue to make himself available for those assessments. And who knows what triggered his suicide? It is a tragic reminder of the impact of war, of deployment on young men and women. It is also true to say-in my view anyway-that it is not just deployment to a war zone that can cause post-traumatic stress disorder. When we send young men and women overseas on peacekeeping or peacemaking deployments we also run the risk of them contracting or coming back with post-traumatic stress disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder is real. In many ways as a veteran, I have been fortunate. I sit in a wheelchair. People can see my injuries. They are very obvious. I have never had to fight to have them recognised. I have had to fight with the department on a number of occasions, however, over other issues. But someone who comes home from a deployment who has posttraumatic stress disorder has a wound which is not as readily identifiable as mine or those of others in similar circumstances. Because of that, there is a tendency by some people in the department and in government to disbelieve the individual making the claim. I have no doubt that from time to time there are those who will try to use the system to their own advantage, but we cannot and should not penalise genuine individuals like this young man who I have spoken about today. We must give them the benefit of the doubt. We must understand that post-traumatic stress disorder, having been better identified in recent decades, is a real problem for young soldiers, young men and women. We have to do better as a nation and as a government, and our departments who we charge with dealing with these veterans have to do better in the way they are handling these young men and women who present. I think much of that responsibility comes back to us in parliament. I am not convinced that the military compensation laws that went through this place a couple of years ago-and I said this at the time-act in the best interests of young men and women seeking compensation. We certainly have to look at the problem of multiagencies, and we have to stop making young men and women, like this young fellow who tragically committed suicide, jump through the hoops and have to front for continual and constant assessment. We have to do better than that. If we do not, we are going to experience, tragically, suicide within our veteran community. Having said that, there is one matter I very quickly want to turn to. I want to compliment the minister on the support that he gave to the Operation Aussies Home blokes in Vietnam, Jim Bourke and his team, who have been fighting tenaciously for a long period of time to identify, and have fully accounted for, the six MIAs in Vietnam. I had the opportunity to go to the handover the other day of the remains of the two young 1RAR soldiers. It was very sombre, sad and humbling to be there for that handover. I congratulate Jim Bourke, his team and MAIN COMMITTEE the government team that were sent up there, and I congratulate the minister on the support he gave them. They have all done very, very well. My thoughts particularly on that occasion went out to the family. It must be important for them to have the closure that they now have because of the work of Jim Bourke and his team. recently been privileged to participate in local awards ceremonies to recognise our veterans with the Australian Defence Medal. This is one of many ceremonies I have been proud to be part of in my 17 years in parliament. At these awards, and indeed as I move around the electorate, I am constantly amazed by what these men and women have experienced and achieved. Our veterans served at Gallipoli, the battlefields of western Europe, northern Africa and the Middle East during the First World War. Whilst sadly there are no World WarI veterans still with us, their legacy lives on in their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Veterans also served in South-East Asia, the Pacific and New Guinea as well as Africa and Europe during the Second World War. Since 1945, they have served us proudly in the Pacific, Korea and Japan and helped keep peace in Africa. In the seventies they served us in Vietnam. Most recently they have served in East Timor, the Solomons, Iraq and Afghanistan. Only last month I attended ANZAC Day ceremonies together with the odd smoko in my electorate to recognise and to remember our coming of age as a nation. It is a wonderful experience to be present at a school acknowledging our veterans and to see the children grow in understanding of exactly what we are commemorating. The phrase ‘we salute their service’ is more than just words. It is a commemoration of their contribution to who we are as a nation. The bill before us today, the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007, is a technical bill containing a range of amendments to the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 and other acts which affect the Veterans’ Affairs portfolio. The amendments are minor housekeeping amendments which would correct some unintended consequences of the current drafting and better align the income support and pension arrangements under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act with those of the Social Security Act 1991. I wish to take this opportunity, however, to make some remarks about our veterans. Too often we see on television or read in the newspapers about the health concerns facing our veterans-health concerns that are both physical and mental. A quick Google search provides a massive list of studies and statistics on matters relating to the health of veterans. Let me just refer to one. A story in the Australian newspaper on 29 January this year quoted from documents obtained under freedom of information laws. These documents revealed, as the article starts: ONE in four Australian soldiers who served in Vietnam has made a successful claim for post-traumatic stress disorder. One in four is a cruel reflection of what our Vietnam veterans have experienced. It is an appalling national figure. The article also states that there is now an impact on our service people from recent military operations in East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan. The article goes on to quote Professor McFarlane, head of the University of Adelaide’s Centre for Military and Veterans’ Health and a senior adviser in psychiatry to the ADF. Professor McFarlane stated that post-traumatic stress could manifest years after the events that had caused the actual harm. He is quoted as saying: “Someone can function extraordinarily well in combat and break down some years later.” MAIN COMMITTEE",199,Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment 2007 Measures No 1
211,Mr Melham (Banks) (11.57 Am),"With colleagues from both sides of the HouseI haveThis is just one of many thousands of stories which indicate the extent of the illness we are dealing with. I can have little respect for a government that stands up and says how proud it is of our veterans and yet does little to ensure that they are looked after with special care on their return to civilian life. It is simply unacceptable. I wish to refer to a letter I received from a returned serviceman from Picnic Point in my electorate. Mr John Shields wrote to me regarding the inconsistency of this government’s current indexing of the totally and permanently incapacitated disability pension. To be eligible for a T&PI pension, a veteran must be in receipt of 70 per cent or more of the general rate disability pension; unable to work more than eight hours per week because of his or her accepted disabilities, and for those disabilities alone; suffering a loss of income that would not otherwise be lost; and under 65 years of age. There are also special rules for granting the pension to a veteran who is 65 years or older in recognition that this is normally considered pension age. In my electorate of Banks, according to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs statistics provided by the parliamentary website, there are 112 T&PI or special rate pensioners. Their average age is 72.22 years. Mr Shields drew my attention to an article in the Vietnam veteran newsletter dated March 2007. This article provides a copy of a letter from the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. The essence of the letter is the loss of value in the T&PI pension since 1979. The bottom line, according to the author of the letter from the VVFA, is: The TPI pension was 47.3% of the average wage in 1997 and it is now 43.5%. The TPI pension is losing its value. As I understand it, the T&PI pension is adjusted in line with the cost-of-living index. Incomes in the form of wages tend to increase at a faster rate than the cost-of-living adjustments. By 2004 the T&PI pension had lost $78 in value because adjustments are made in line with the cost-of-living index rather than average wages. Prior to 1997 all Commonwealth pensions were increased in line with the consumer price index. There was a lag factor, as I indicated earlier, whereby wages increased more quickly than the cost of living; therefore, pensions were always behind. In 1997 the increases to almost all Commonwealth pensions were readjusted to reflect increases in the average wage rather than in the CPI. The exception was the T&PI pension. Recently there was another change, and 60 per cent of the T&PI has been indexed to movements in the average wage. I fail to understand why this is the case. Why are T&PI pensioners any different to general disability pensioners, age pensioners or war widows? This simply does not make any sense. Labor has determined that this is a gross injustice and that it will resolve it if elected. The shadow minister, the member for Bruce, said at the ALP national conference on 29 April: We need a Veterans’ Affairs policy that focuses on restoring the value of compensation – it is not enough for a Government to introduce services, it must maintain them to avoid a recurring cycle of playing catch ups as we have seen with the current Government. Delegates, the value of compensation for our most severely disabled war veterans has been eroding compared to the standard of living in the broader community. This is unacceptable. The Labor government would restore the value of the T&PI intermediate rate and the extreme disablement adjustment pensions by indexing the whole of these pensions to movements in male total average weekly earnings or the consumer price index, whichever is the greater. MAIN COMMITTEE It is anticipated that such a change would directly impact on 43,000 war veterans with disabilities. Certainly, it would improve the lot of 112 T&PI pensioners in the electorate of Banks. In the budget, the Treasurer announced an increase of $50 a fortnight for special rate T&PI pensions. I am pleased for these pension recipients that this increase has occurred. It is better than nothing, but surely the Treasurer and the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs realise that there must be some certainty beyond the whim of any government in terms of these increases, which is why I suggest the formula be as I have stated. Certainty can quite simply be achieved by tying the pension rate to the male total average weekly earnings. It is not too much to ask that people know from week to week, year to year, exactly what they can anticipate in terms of their pension. There is no point in just waiting until a budget before an election for the anticipated increase. The Labor leader and the shadow minister in a joint statement on 6 May estimated that under Labor’s proposal the recipients of the T&PI pensions will be $1,700 better off with their pensions building up to $30 more a fortnight than they otherwise have been. Labor has listened to this country’s veterans such as Mr John Shields of Picnic Point, and promises to act to fix the problem. This should not be a political issue for either side of politics. It should be an issue embraced by both sides of politics. Veterans deserve it. Anyone who puts on a uniform for this country deserves to be properly looked after when they return. They do not deserve to be ignored. They do not deserve the bean counters to continue to do a job on them as they have done year in and year out. The budget delivered last night showed that we are awash with money. The veterans in our community should be looked after and dealt with the same as other recipients of welfare benefits in our community. They should not be discriminated against. They should not be treated in a way that is costing them thousands of dollars that they otherwise are entitled to. I do commend the bill to the parliament. lation Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007. As we have heard from other speakerslet me say from the outset that Labor supports this bill-veterans affairs is an area which always requires improvement. It is certainly an area which I am very passionate about and I am very committed to being a very strong advocate for veterans and their families, not just in my electorate of Richmond but nationwide as well. This bill addresses a number of housekeeping items in regard to veterans affairs legislation. Nonetheless, these are important amendments which streamline the process and regulations by which veterans access government services. These amendments will better align the income support and pension arrangements under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act and those of the Social Security Act 1991. Passage of these amendments will see sensible changes that will actually help veterans and their families access those services of which they are most deserving. The provisions of the bill address anomalies from the original act and its subsequent amendments. Labor welcomes these very overdue changes. As we have heard, this bill comprises five schedules. Schedule1 details changes better outlining other compensatory provisions for veterans and their families, with particular reference to spousal income. In this sense, it better aligns the VEA with the Social Security Act 1991, which will result in less confusion for these families. Schedule2 deals specifically with medical issues for returned service men and women. This is an area of veterans legislation in MAIN COMMITTEE",204,Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment 2007 Measures No 1
212,Mrs Elliot (Richmond) (12.08 Pm),"I rise also to speak on the Veterans’ Affairs Legiswhich we can and must see improvement. It is so important to deal effectively with the ongoing health problems suffered by many veterans and of course the flow-on anguish which affects their families and loved ones and those close to them. As we have heard other speakers say today, the experience of military service, particularly in armed combat, often results in both harrowing physical and mental conditions which are indeed very complex. In recognition of this, the process in which returned service men and women access these services should be as straightforward as possible. Of course, that cannot always be the case; nonetheless, this should not weaken our commitment in this area. Specifically, schedule 2 amends the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. It allows that any unintended or intended injury or disease arising from medical treatment for an existing service related ailment will be counted as arising from that original diagnosis. It allows provisions for the medical profession to deal with the health issues of veterans without the timely and confusing process of tracing liability-and this certainly is an overdue yet welcome provision within this bill. Schedule3 is straightforward, simply repealing redundant provisions that have been in the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act as a result of the amendments to the VEA that were later repealed and substituted. Schedules 4 and 5 deal with issues relating to veterans pensions and taxation. Schedule4 will ensure that income support supplements for veterans included in the list of payments are exempted from the requirement to provide a tax file number to investment bodies for certain investments. So it brings the income support supplement in line with other payments claimed by veterans. Schedule5 deals specifically with Defence Force income support allowance payments. The provisions of this schedule align this payment with the way an ordinary age pension will be treated in regard to taxation requirements. Simply put, these payments will receive the same tax exemptions that exist on the age pension. Commencing on 1 July this year, this is a sensible provision which will help veterans and their families deal with taxation issues. As I stated earlier, Labor supports these changes. They are uncontroversial, yet their debate gives this chamber an opportunity to reflect on the commitment that veterans have shown our country through their service and, indeed, the way we honour and respect that service. My electorate of Richmond has one of the highest number of veterans in the country. I am often touched by their stories and saddened by hearing of the difficulties they face, both medically and in accessing government services. Indeed, veterans and their families face a unique set of challenges-challenges which they should be assisted in dealing with by the full commitment of the Australian government. I wish that I could say that this is the case. The unfortunate truth, however, is that the Howard government has often neglected this group. I want to touch specifically on the area of lack of resources provided for those veterans and their families suffering from mental health issues as a direct result of their service to Australia. Mental health issues for veterans are areas that are often misunderstood in terms of treatment as well as the government provisions available to those needing treatment. Of course, the complexities involved with these issues, particularly with post-traumatic stress disorder, are very involved. Simply put, there are not enough resources and there are not enough people trained to understand these complexities and the multitude of issues surrounding mental health for veterans. There is not enough support for families living day in and day out in these particular situations. MAIN COMMITTEE Veterans and their families often face an uphill battle in understanding and accessing the support services in this area and are very often reliant on underresourced non-profit organisations for very vital support. These groups, committed to helping veterans and their families wherever they can, of course do a wonderful job, but they are indeed facing an uphill battle. More resources are long overdue in both understanding and treating the difficulties faced by veterans once they complete their service. This is certainly an issue that I will continue to fight for. It is vitally important that we do have an improvement in services in this area. The Labor Party recognises and understands the complexity of veterans affairs issues. These issues are on a number of fronts: health, including mental health, which I have just outlined; finance; and recognition of service, just to name a few. They are complicated issues which must be addressed of course by the whole community but ones in which the federal government should play a very vital and leading role. In response to this responsibility, the federal Labor Party has recently outlined its policy to increase benefits for our nation’s most severely disabled war veterans. These are the men and women who have paid a staggering price in the service of our country and the men and women who have indeed been severely neglected by the Howard government. Essentially, Labor’s proposal will restore the value of the special rate disability pensionTPI and TTI intermediate rate. These pensions, on which thousands of veterans and their families rely as often their only source of income, have been steadily eroded by the Howard government. I was very pleased to see that a Rudd Labor government will address this gross injustice, particularly for the over 600 veterans in Richmond who will be direct beneficiaries of a policy such as that. Of course, the problem is one specifically of indexation. Over the last 10 years these pensions have been indexed only to the CPI. Estimates are that, because of this, the value of the pension has decreased. In the case of a special rate disability pension, the loss in value has been over $70 per fortnight. The Labor Party is committed to addressing this injustice. In 1997 the Howard government indexed a range of pensions, but the above rate general pension was not one of them. The undeniable fact of this decision by the government is that veterans are now struggling to meet the day-to-day increased cost of living. Federal Labor will index these pensions to the total average weekly earnings or the CPI, whichever is greater. This will of course have a very significant impact on thousands of families. It is the very least we can do for these men and women, many of whom have paid a very high price in the service of our country. I urge the Howard government to see the humanity in this proposal and adopt it as soon as possible. I do not believe there has been another issue which has been of such sustained and passionate concern in the veterans policy area over the last 10 years as this particular one. Certainly many veterans in my electorate have approached me over the last few years concerning this matter, and I was very pleased to see the shadow minister for veterans’ affairs and the opposition leader making this announcement last week. As I said before, Labor stands ready to support any initiative that the Howard government makes in this area. We certainly encourage it to come forth and follow our lead and match that commitment. I was quite appalled that the veterans’ affairs minister attacked this plan to increase the benefits. Federal Labor has challenged the minister to explain why he is opposing increasing these benefits. It is quite disheartening to see that Australia appears to have a veterans’ affairs minister who does not appear to be supporting our veterans. I believe this is a MAIN COMMITTEE cynical and tired government that has consistently ignored the difficulties faced by veterans. It should feel shamed, particularly on this specific issue. A fortnight has passed since this country paused on ANZAC Day to honour the commitment and sacrifice made by our returned servicemen and servicewomen. Services were held right across the country to acknowledge veterans in our community. Particularly in Richmond, it is wonderful to see more people coming out each year to these services, whether it be the dawn services or the marches during the day. It was an absolute honour that Peter Cosgrove was able to attend the march and the service that we had at Kingscliff. It was wonderful to see so many younger children involved and taking the time to remember and respect the service of so many. As I stated earlier, my electorate of Richmond does have one of the largest numbers of veterans in the country. One of my greatest honours as an MP is being able to constantly meet with them and the local RSLs and different veterans groups throughout the community, work with them and hear their concerns first hand. I am sure we all agree it is moving to hear those stories when they speak of their experiences, their service and their often great hardship and sacrifice. But it also inspires me to fight for recognition for them and their service. It was wonderful to see so many people recognising that service on ANZAC Day. Previous speakers have said that, with different community functions of late, we have been able to recognise them through the presentation of the ADMs. Last year in Richmond many community groups worked together with veterans groups to have the first Richmond Remembers event-which is a week-long series of events involving schoolchildren and the community-in which we took time to remember the service of veterans from all conflicts. It is an event that I hope will continue for many years, as everyone in our community remembers the service of so many. In conclusion, I reiterate that Labor supports the changes I outlined earlier. We are pleased that the government has put them forward and is dealing with the anomalies that have occurred through the amendments to the original legislation. With regard to issues facing veterans and their families, however, I emphasise that there is much more to be done in this area. It is quite disheartening that the Howard government has often neglected to deal with the unique difficulties that veterans and their families face. As I have said, federal Labor has already put forward a plan to rectify the area of indexation of the pensions provided to our most severely disabled war veterans. Again, I strongly urge the Howard government to see the injustice of the system currently in place and to do the right thing and introduce legislation which would deal with it. It would certainly receive great support right across the chamber. This is an area that has to be addressed. I am very privileged to represent the many hundreds of veterans living in the Richmond electorate. I believe our nation is indebted to those courageous Australians who put their lives on the line in the service of our country and I remain absolute in my commitment to honouring them and their place in our history. Ms ANNETTE ELLIS (Canberra) (12.20 pm)-I am very pleased to have the opportunity this afternoon to speak on the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007. Of course, the main purpose of the minor housekeeping amendments in this bill is to correct some unintended consequences of the current drafting and better align the income support and pension arrangements under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act with those of the SoMAIN COMMITTEE cial Security Act 1991. The amendments in this bill are supported on the basis that they seek to remedy some unintended consequences of the current drafting of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. The bill presents in great detail amendments to a range of sections of the acts-outlined very well, I might add, by the Parliamentary Library briefing on this bill-on which I do not intend to speak in detail other than to say that it is good to see we can have a correction and have the appropriate parts of this legislation amended, as is obviously required. This also gives me an opportunity, quite appropriately, to bring to the attention of the chamber a concern I have in relation to services affecting veterans in my electorate. In doing so, I refer particularly to the Veterans Home Care program, the VHC program. I would like to speak briefly about some of the issues that have arisen in my area as a result of some changes that are taking place. I want to note quite openly that I have approached the minister on this matter and have received a very long and detailed response, some four pages, to my correspondence, for which I am grateful. There seems to me to be a need to talk a little about some of the issues at a human level. My understanding is that the Veterans Home Care program had been operating around the countryside for some time and that the ACT Department of Health unit had successfully tendered for the operation of this program here in the ACT and was quite happily the facilitator of the program. Last year, with the contract period coming to an end in December and the department calling for new tenders, the process changed somewhat and the ACT Department of Health unit made the decision not to tender again, as to do so would have meant that they would be tendering in a competitive process to supply this service to the ACT, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. This was a little outside what they saw as their jurisdiction in the way they had operated in the past, so they made a conscious decision not to tender. I understand that at the end of the process an organisation called Aged Care& Housing Group Limited, ACH Group, from South Australia were given the new contract and that from December, when that contract came into place, they were the organisation running this process and a number of organisations in different parts of the four jurisdictions I have mentioned carry out the work on behalf of that organisation. It is fair to say that, from about January onwards, my electorate office began to get phone calls from people in the community who were expressing concern about some of the changes that this process had led to. An officer from ACH Group with whom we had a conversation indicated that, from their perspective, they were implementing the program as per guidelines only. They admitted that they had run into a number of unhappy veterans during phone assessments. It seems to me that maybe phone assessments are part of the problem. These people are being assessed, as I understand it-and I stand to be corrected if I am wrong-with a telephone interview. We are talking about fairly elderly people. Also, in discussion with us, one of the many providers in this region carrying out this work on behalf of ACH Group said that on-the-ground providers of some care support they were giving were indicating to some of them that they may have a few concerns about some of the changes and the impacts of the changes, but they obviously take direction from ACH Group. We had a discussion with Legacy. I am sure they will not mind me mentioning this. Legacy is a wonderful community organisation. Like all members in this place, our electorate officers speak to hundreds of organisations doing good work out there. It appears that some of their MAIN COMMITTEE people may have been approached by some of the recipients of this program in the normal way that they would for support. In the way that they understood it, in relation to the changes, it appears that they were seeing some unnecessary stress, as they would describe it, being put upon some of our veteran widows in particular. On this side of the chamber, we are not against changes. If there is a good reason to change something then obviously you do. But when you are dealing with vulnerable, frail, elderly people-those living on their own in particular-you have to make absolutely certain that the way you are carrying out those changes has the least possible negative impact that you could wish for. I will just outline very briefly some of the things that have changed. I will not mention names, even though the minister is aware of whom I am speaking about, because we were very honest with him. An elderly couple in their 80s were getting an hour and a half for shopping and an hour and a half for cleaning once a fortnight, alternating. That has changed and now only one person, instead of two people, has to do both of those jobs. The elderly couple has to pay slightly more. It is still a small cost, but they have to pay slightly more. The belief is that the worse thing that has changed is that the clients cannot go out shopping with the carers anymore. In the past they were taken out shopping; now they are left at home. I understand that it is for insurance reasons. I am happy for all of this to be clarified. From the point of view of my constituents, it was the only opportunity for the gentleman to leave the house for a purposeful reason, maybe other than going to a doctor, and he enjoyed those shopping expeditions. That was to change or it had changed. Everybody I am talking about is in their late 70s, 80s or 90s. Another lady previously had someone coming every day to shower and dress her, along with three hours a week for shopping and socialising and two hours a fortnight for cleaning. Now she is getting showered only three times a week. She cannot dress herself properly because of her physical problems. She now has only two hours for shopping and is not allowed to go out shopping with a staff member. She understands that, if she wants to go to the bank and nobody can take her, a PIN needs to be made available. I am not sure whether that is completely accurate, but it is a query. She is pretty concerned about the changes that are affecting her. A gentleman was previously receiving a shower every day and that has been cut back to three showers a week. He has to deal with some physical problems. I think that has been resumed to virtually a daily shower. He cannot get transport assistance from DVA for medical appointments or social outings. He can no longer go shopping with the carer as he could in the past. That was mentioned constantly. He is feeling the lack of availability of transport. In my office we are trying to see whether we can link up someone like him with a program run by a community service. These folk have stability in their life because they have a program. If anything changes, it is a huge issue for these folk. It is for those reasons that I want to talk about it. When change is needed, yes, let us do it, but can we please be aware of what we are doing and somehow walk these folk through what needs to be done. There is another person, a woman who is 80-plus years of age, who is really angry about the phone assessment process. She is uncomfortable with it and feels that she is not being seen, in the true sense of an assessment. Her hours have also been dramatically cut. Legacy has been involved. As a result of Legacy’s involvement, I understand that any changes for her MAIN COMMITTEE have been deferred-maybe to around June-to see whether she can be assisted in sliding across to other services, if that be the case. There is another woman, who is 85-plus, whose son contacted us. He does what he can to assist his mother, but, again, certain services were cut back from two hours a week to two hours a fortnight and then to nothing. I understand that the department offered an annual spring-clean but then said, ‘We can’t do that unless all the internal windows have been prestripped by you first, and we will not do the second storey.’ These are the sorts of stories that we have been given, and we have fed these stories quite honestly to the minister. I will refer to his reply in a moment. There is also another darling who is 92. She had three hours a week for washing and basic cleaning cut back to 1½ hours. She is not at all very mobile, and, again, Legacy is involved with her. As I said, I am attempting to be very honest and generous about this because there may be good reasons for certain changes taking place. In the minister’s letter, he said to me that the VHC program assists Australia’s veterans, war widows and widowers with low-care needs to remain at home for longer-and we applaud that-and that it provides domestic assistance; respite care, in-home and residential; personal care; and safety related home and garden maintenance. The in-home respite is only available to people with a carer-I understand that-but the domestic assistance and the personal care is the stuff of import to these people. I do not wish to go through all the detail in the minister’s letter. Suffice to say that the department has indicated that maybe some of these people were incorrectly assessed or incorrectly serviced in the previous tendering contracts. I do not know whether that is true, because I think it is all being looked at. The minister also said that where they believe there has been or where there is now an inappropriate supply of service, some folk may need to be referred to other programs-HACC programs or other community programs. That is not really an issue for me, I guess. At the end of the day, I want these people to get the services they need in the most untraumatic, friendly and sensitive way possible. If a reassessment or reassignment is needed for the people in this age group, I think it would be better if it was not done by phone. It is a good thing to walk into their home and actually see their surroundings, understand their needs and their physicality, or otherwise, and make an assessment on that basis. Be that as it may, should there be the decision at the end of the day that people like this have to be reassessed and reassigned to another service, can it please be done with sensitivity so that it does not result in the trauma that I believe may be occurring with some of these people. It is fair to say that some of that trauma could be attributed to their age, their frailty and their situation in life. For whatever reason, I think this needs a little bit of care. I am not blaming the minister but, somehow down the line, we need to find a way to handle this. I am not happy when I get a phone call from a 92-year-old woman who is maintaining herself remarkably well in her own home, considering her age-and I think she is the one I am referring to; one of them has a very severe sight impairment-and find out that the service that she has been getting, which was only three hours a week, has been cut back to 1½ hours. One wonders whether a cutback of that nature is really required. Three hours a week is not a lot of time, does not cost a lot of money and does not involve a lot of care, but she was happy with it. MAIN COMMITTEE I am grateful to have had the opportunity during this debate to bring the Main Committee’s attention to the changes in the VHC program and to appeal to the minister and to his folk that they do all they canMrs Bronwyn BishopMr Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene. way? Ms ANNETTE ELLIS-Yes, certainly. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-I wonder whether, for the purpose of what you have been discussing, the vet’s care system is using an aged care assessment team to assess the clients? Ms ANNETTE ELLIS-I am happy to try to answer that. Somewhere in the minister’s letter I think he says that part of the process for these people-and I stand to be corrected if I have this wrong-would be that they would need to go through an ACAT assessment to get another form of service-for instance, a CAHP, a care at home package. So if this process has decided that they are no longer eligible, for whatever reason, the minister is suggesting in part of this response that they need to go through an ACAT assessment for that purpose-that is, not to stay where they are but to go into an entirely different package, which would be a care at home package through the aged-care system. I will draw my remarks to a conclusion there. I thank the member for her intervention. As I said, I am not really complaining so much as bringing to the attention of people the fact that we need to be so sensitive and so careful when we are dealing with people in this category. I know for all intents and purposes we all share that view, but occasionally we need to have a reminder that, whatever we need to do to look after these folk, we should do. In the end, I hope that these people have the service that they were getting reinstated or that they can slide across as seamlessly as possible-and with all the help they need-into what is considered to be a more appropriate service, be that as it may. I thank the chamber for its attention. Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007, which is a bill to amend the law relating to veterans entitlements and military rehabilitation and compensation and for other purposes, I wish to make a few remarks about the nation’s obligation to those that serve in the defence forces. Some 21 years ago I concluded a 13-year period of my life when I worked for the then department of repatriation. I was of a fortunate generation of officers of that department in that, for that 13 years, we did not have forces on active duty. We had defence personnel involved in peacekeeping missions in a number of places around the world, but of course now in the first decade of the 21st century we operate in a completely different environment. We have several contingents of defence personnel very much on the front line. So the type of danger that defence personnel are in is greatly different. We also have a greater awareness of our obligation to those employed in our defence forces but not on active service, because there have been a number of accidents of an occupational health and safety nature in peacetime movements and the like that we have learnt a lot from. I am also from a generation that is proud to indicate that it marched in moratorium marches. I am of a generation whose marble was in the last ballot of conscription to take place-a ballot that did not have any use because that intake was never taken up. But I am MAIN COMMITTEE",206,Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment 2007 Measures No 1

214,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (12.36 Pm),"In support of the Veterans’ Affairs Legislationalso of a generation that did not see active participation in protests against the government’s decision to send forces overseas and for the way in which those returning ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen were treated. I admit that at the time. I did not understand the conditions that confronted those returning ex-defence personnel. I think that as a nation we should be genuinely ashamed of the way in which those people were treated when they returned. I am pleased that in the intervening nearly 40 years, especially for the Vietnam conflict, many processes have taken place that have healed that open sore. It is, of course, interesting that sometimes Korean vets do not think that they have yet seen similar actions and can sometimes be of the opinion that they are beginning to be a forgotten generation of our returned service men and women. But the lessons that we learnt through those actions should dictate the way in which we are able to treat and administer those pieces of legislation that deal with proper compensation and proper recognition of the sacrifices made. To the extent that this piece of legislation tidies up a number of items and brings into line some of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act measures with the Social Security Act and the like, the opposition has no great problem with it. But one aspect that goes to the way in which the ex-service community see themselves being treated relates to the length of time that is taken for the assessment of claims. This was first brought to my attention by a welfare officer at one of the local RSLs that service the community that is covered by the electorate of Scullin. I suppose from my past career within the department I have an understanding of the proper way in which these things have to be assessed. The act has changed drastically since my time. The references to the way in which these things are assessed have changed dramatically. But I would have hoped that that made it a simpler task to ensure that claims are processed within the proper periods. This is a matter that the member for Bruce, the shadow minister for veterans’ affairs, touched upon. When we look at the last annual report of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs-the 2005-06 annual report-we find that, under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, the average time taken for processing primary injury claims has blown out from 90 to 146 days, up 62 per cent from the time taken in 2004-05. According to the figures given, we find that the time for processing new impairment claims has increased from 26 to 130 days. Perhaps that is a statistical anomaly because it is a small number of claims, and we might not dwell too much on that. However, the average time taken to process primary compensation claims under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act was 106 days, a 40 per cent increase over a target that had been set of 75 days. These are the things that are causing concern in the community. As I said, there are from time to time reasons that these things take a while. It is not being churlish to observe that we see there has been a reduction of one-eighth in the number of claims processing staff. It appears there was no mention in the budget of any increase in the number of staff. I raise these matters not for the sake of political point-scoring but to indicate that, when things like this lead to a perception that veterans are not being treated with the importance they deserve, it rolls on to concerns about a whole host of matters. We should have learnt the lesson that, no matter how hard we try to have proper recognition of the service given, no matter how often we say that we treat that service as being important, we have to make sure that our actions indicate that. MAIN COMMITTEE At one of the ceremonies for the Australian Defence Medal recently, I had a chat to a man who had served in the Royal Navy. He had had the misfortune of being in the vicinity of both collisions of the HMAS Melbourne. What was interesting about the discussion was that, while this was a peacetime activity, it still gave him great distress in a psychological sense because there was no discussion, debriefing and counselling after the incidents. He has vivid memories of retrieving bodies and the like. These are, as I said, important matters that we have to make sure that we understand so that we can do the right thing. He had another interesting beef that I think is ongoing at the moment. He was one of the guys who were asked to go in and clean-I describe them as bilge tanks; there is probably some other technical term-within the outer skin of the ship and the inner skin. To describe his working conditions as Dickensian is probably raising them up because at least the chimney sweeps were of a small stature. I do not think this man was of a small stature, but they hauled themselves down, attached to the manhole by a rope. They had to be careful of the conditions because of the build-up of gases and different substances. As I understand it, there is an ongoing discussion about whether the conditions exposed them to a variety of chemicals that have been injurious to health and it is something that I have asked him to give me further detail on. I hope to be able to return to that at some other time. The other thing that I have to observe is that for once, by comparison to the United States, I think we can hold our head high. I refer to the recent discussion of the treatment of US returned service people in their veterans administration hospitals, which is nothing short of scandalous. I do not refer to this because the member for Mackellar is in the chamber but I think the checks and balances that the Australian parliament has in dwelling on the actions of departments would have picked up the types of things that we saw in the United States much earlier than was the case in the United States. However, it appears there might have been a small deception of US Senate committees about the way in which the veterans affairs hospital in Washington was being administered. I think it is very important, without pointing a finger and accusing people of not doing the right thing, that we do have these processes so that we can indicate our concern. I hope that the minister and, through the minister, the department would see my comments about the blow-out in processing times in that light. As I said, at the end of the day you can have a collection of cases that might be more difficult than another collection of cases. When we are dealing with a community that is very sensitive to the way that it is treated-it is in the context of political decisions of the government, for instance, not to put in place indexation of benefits and the like, which is in a different sphere of political discussion-we must make sure that the perception is not that because of laxity in the blow-out of times we in some way do not recognise the service. With the way that modern warfare is conducted, a whole new range of pressures is being placed on members who are in active service and we must ensure that we keep cognisant of those new pressures. There may be people who, because of great fortune, do not see themselves as being directly under fire, but that pressure of not knowing what is around the corner is as real as the pressure experienced when under direct fire. That sort of pressure is seen to exist in all conflicts and it becomes even greater in the types of conflicts that Australian troops are involved in at the moment, where there is uncertainty about who the enemy really is and MAIN COMMITTEE whether they are dealing with friend or foe. SoI think people’s psychological wellness should be paramount. I was in the department when the Vietnam Veterans’ Counselling Service first commenced. I think that was one of the first steps in bridging the gap between the perception that Vietnam vets were not accepted by the community and the fact that people wanted to reach out to them and understand the types of pressures they had confronted and the type of assistance they needed. I hope that we continue to do that for all generations and for waves of service personnel that return from involvement in conflict. Finally, I wish to say-and this probably is completely off the piece of legislation before us-that I still have a little concern about the purchasing practices of Defence and making sure that Defence personnel, especially on active service, are adequately kitted up and given the right equipment. But that again is a debate for another day. I simply conclude that I am very proud of the tradition, which has continued in a bipartisan manner, of the repatriation system, now called the veterans affairs system. I hope that the minister takes on board our concerns about processing times. I hope that, in a political sense, the government, when sharing the bounty it holds in its coffers, will recognise that the veterans community see themselves as deserving of additional resource. Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007. Firstly, I indicate that I support the bill. However, in doing so, I reserve the right to make some criticisms of the way it appears that administration of certain claims relating to a departmental undertaking relating to veterans has occurred, particularly when looking at the clients of that department. The clients of that department are people who have served this country well. They have taken upon themselves the security of this nation, in a range of different capacities, in various theatres overseas. I think veterans expect probably no more or no less than to be treated decently. It is of concern when we find that, under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, the processing of veterans claims is taking in the order of 106 days, with the target position being 65 days. That is a difference of about 40 per cent between the targeted time for processing and the actual time taken. For most businesses, that would be of concern. However, in a business that is there to service the veterans of this nation, I think it is not simply a concern; it is unjust. Without putting too fine a point on it or weighing that criticism, I think that is one of those things we need to do better for the people who have performed such a wonderful task for this country. By the way, it is not just veterans who have served in the armed forces overseas. Do not forget that, since 1964, something like 2,000 police officers have served in peacekeeping operations overseas, starting with operations in Cyprus and more recently those in East Timor and other locations. Having been seconded from the police forces of the various states, territories and, indeed, the Commonwealth and serving in those theatres, those officers were also covered by the Veterans’ Entitlements Act for their period of operations while overseas. So it is not just military people who are only too deserving of being treated appropriately under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act but also those police officers who have served this country well, as they have taken a lead role in many respects in peacekeeping operations. From my discussions with Vietnam vets from my electorate, the Ingleburn RSL sub-branch and Mr Max Chin from Dredges Cottage in Campbelltown, you would not class veterans as MAIN COMMITTEE",213,Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment 2007 Measures No 1
215,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (12.52 Pm),"I am happy to rise on the Veterans’ Affairs Legislationwhingers. They are people who are there to support their colleagues-they are very collegiate in the way they approach that. They are very forthright and no doubt the department will recall how forthright these guys can be but, quite frankly, they stick up for one another as they probably did in times of hostilities. They are not whingers. They simply want a fair go and they want to be treated with respect and dignity. One of the things they have laboured is the delays in processing claims by the department and that concerns not only them in terms of the operations they provide locally but the support mechanism they afford to their members in those respective locations. I take it that most people are across the fact that last night the government announced that there will be an increase in the TPI rate, the special rate and the intermediate rate for veteran disability of $50 and $25 per fortnight respectively. I have to say that is welcome. I also draw the attention of the chamber to the fact that the pension entitlement for these people has not been indexed; it has been eroded and, as a consequence, has very much affected the purchasing power-to use a crude term-of these veterans. It is something that they have been quite critical of. Bear in mind that I am speaking of people who have served this country in the Second World War, the Korean War, the Malayan and the Vietnam engagements, the Gulf War, East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan. We need to be sensitive to this. When veterans go on a veterans entitlement pension, they should not be seen as out of sight, out of mind. They are people who deserve the highest respect that we can give them as a consequence of the service they have provided, and it is only proper that we reward them appropriately. That is why Labor have announced only very recently that, from our first budget, we will be indexing the pension entitlement for these people, which will make sure that their pensions are not eroded and that they are treated with dignity and respect. I think that is something that should stay very much at the front and centre of the mind of the legislature when we are talking about making laws affecting people who have already committed themselves rather heavily for this country. It pains me to report that in 1997, for instance, the special rate for a disability pension represented 46.3 per cent of the total average male weekly earnings. Now a person on that same pension is earning only 42.9 per cent of the total average male weekly earnings. It has regrettably been allowed to simply fade away-out of sight, out of mind. WhilstI welcome what occurred in the budget last night to make some redress to that, this must be taken into the future and must be subject to indexation. I support the initiatives taken by Kevin Rudd and Alan Griffin, the shadow minister for veterans’ affairs, in committing Labor to a position of restoring that fundamental aspect of dignity and respect for the veterans of this nation. Debate (on motion by Mrs Bronwyn Bishop) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 1 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs: Departmental Property (Question No. 5146) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 7 December 2006: (1) For each financial year from 1 July 2004, what was the total cost to the Minister’s department of departmental property reported missing. (2) For the financial year 2005-06, what items of property were reported missing and what was the cost of each. For each financial year since 1 July 2004, the costs to my department (organisational entity as per Administrative Arrangements Orders for the relevant period) of property reported as missing were $7,150, $62,035 and $8,534 (as at the end of February 2007).

Parliament: Travel Services (Question No. 5289) Ms Hoare asked the Special Minister of State, in writing, on 7 December 2006: (1) Will he provide details of projected savings that will arise from the require increased use of the electronic parliamentary travel booking system, which has been included as a productivity increase for staff under the proposed Members of Parliament (Staff) Certified Agreement 2006-2009. (2) Do the projected savings take account of the requirement of many Members and Senators to make frequent changes to reservations, which may not be made on the electronic parliamentary booking system. (3) Were projected savings a consideration in the recent selection of a provider of parliamentary travel services; if so, were all tenderers made aware of the anticipated savings. (4) Can he confirm that, in order for savings and productivity increases to be achieved, the travel requirements of Members and Senators will determine whether staff employed under the proposed Members of Parliament (Staff) Certified Agreement 2006-2009 receive pay increases in 2007 and 2008; if so, was this considered when the anticipated productivity increase was included in the proposed agreement. (1) The increase in use of the on-line domestic travel booking system, to nine per cent in 2007 and 15 per cent in 2008 was identified as a productivity initiative during the consultation process for the Members of Parliament (Staff) Collective Agreement 2006-2009. Discussions with members of the Staff Representative Group highlighted the on-line domestic travel booking system as an area where utilisation could be increased without impacting upon the operations, flexibility or entitlements of Senators and Members. (2) The projected increases remained small to take into account the requirement of many Senators and Members to make frequent changes to reservations. (3) The innovative use of technology was identified as a key objective of the Parliamentary Travel Services request for tender. Tenderers were required to provide a Strategic Services Plan (SSP) outlining their approach to the phased development and the introduction of initiatives to improve the cost effectiveness and quality of service delivery and to improve the overall value for money. In addition, Finance provided a pricing model for tenderers to complete that would enable the identi-",231,Questions In Writing
244,Mr Nairn,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:fication and comparison of charges for on-line bookings, consultant assisted bookings and bundled bookings. This pricing information and the SSP formed part of the tender evaluation and assisted in establishing the overall best value for money offer. (4) I can confirm that the travel requirements of Members and Senators will not be the sole determinant of whether staff receive the pay increases in 2007 and 2008 under the new Collective Agreement as the targets relate to overall use of the system, rather than the bookings made by Senators or Members only. Aviation Security (Question No. 5300) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 6 February 2007: In respect of walk-through metal detector booths at Australian airports: (a) is the detection level of the booths set and calibrated by private sector contractors or by government employees; (b) are booths at different airports calibrated to different levels, if so why; and (c) how often are (i) metal detector booths inspected and recalibrated and (ii) unannounced inspections conducted. (a) Walk through metal detectors (WTMDs) are calibrated by security officers contracted by the relevant airport screening authority. (b) Walk through metal detectors must be calibrated for each specific location in which they are installed to take into account external factors such as steel reinforcing in floors, metal in surrounding structures and electrical influence from essential wiring. (c) (i) Security authorities are required to inspect and calibrate the walk through metal detectors on a daily basis. Government employees regularly inspect the testing and use of walk through metal detectors. (ii) My Department’s records indicate that for the 2006/2007 Financial Year there have been 71 systems tests of screening points conducted at screened airports around Australia, as at 16 March 2007. All systems tests involve unannounced inspections. Aviation Security (Question No. 5301) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 6 February 2007: In respect of the Office of Transport Security and the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Aviation Transport Security Regulations 2005, for each year since 2005: (a) how many infringement notices were served for a breach of Regulation 4.67 (Security of Flight Crew Compartment) and how many people were successfully prosecuted for a breach of that Regulation; and (b) how many people were charged with breaching Regulation 9.01 (Bomb hoaxes etc.) and how many of those were convicted.

246,Mr Vaile,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Whaling (Question No. 5313) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 6 February 2007: In respect of the pursuit of Japanese whaling vessels by environmental non-government agencies in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters, (a) has the Government advised the Japanese Government and environmental non-government agencies of the need to adhere to international maritime safety conventions, laws and regulations and (b) will the Australian Maritime Safety Authority seek to control and provide guidance on ship operations in and around the Australian, Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters during the current whaling season. (a) Yes. (b) AMSA exercises its powers under international ship safety and pollution prevention conventions to conduct port State control inspections of foreign ships visiting Australian ports. As the Japanese whaling operations are generally conducted on the high seas in the Southern Ocean, international ship safety and pollution prevention conventions do not provide powers to AMSA to control compliance by foreign ships operating on the high seas. This is a matter for the ship’s flag State. AMSA is supporting cooperative action at the International Maritime Organization to promote more robust safety and pollution prevention guidelines for ship operations in ice-covered waters and to consider a new work item concerning rules of engagement for protest vessels. AMSA issued Marine Notice 4/2006 on 18 January 2006 providing general advice to the shipping industry about ship safety and marine pollution prevention in Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic waters. Marine Notice 4/2006 is available on AMSA’s Internet site at: <www.amsa.gov.au> Australians Facing Legal Charges Overseas (Question No. 5316) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 6 February 2007: In respect of his statement on ABC radio on 9 January 2007 that around 180 Australians are facing legal charges overseas and that some Australian politicians, while taking an interest in the case of Mr David Hicks, are not displaying an interest in the other cases: (a) what is the usual city or town of residence of each of the 180 Australians currently facing charges abroad and (b) for each of the 180 cases, will he provide details of (i) the charges that have been brought against the individual, (ii) the length of time for which the individual has been detained and (iii) the consular assistance that the individual has received. On1 February this year 176 Australians were serving sentences overseas following convictions. A further 267 were facing charges overseas, 118 of whom were detained. The nature of the charges and offences range widely, although approximately 130 of those Australians either arrested or convicted faced narcotics charges. Collating details on the charges they face, their usual city or town of residence in Australia, the period they have been detained and the consular assistance given them would require an unreasonable diversion of resources. Attached is a table summarising the location of Australians detained or facing charges overseas, as at 1 February 2007.",234,Questions In Writing

(a) NSW and Victoria are yet to provide the Australian Government with Final Investment plans for NSW Water Recovery Package A, NSW Water Recovery PackageB or the Victorian Lake Mokoan Water Recovery Package. I am therefore unable to confirm the date by which these three projects will be implemented.",235,Questions In Writing
249,Mr Turnbull,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The signed investment agreement for the Goulburn Murray Water Recovery Package sets out a timeline for implementation with completion of the project scheduled for June 2009. (b) Yes. (c) Under the current Living Murray Business Plan, the Australian Government can invest up to 40% of the cost of each water recovery project. When the new The Living Murray Business Plan is approved, the Australian Government would then be able to contribute up to 28.5% of the cost of each water recovery project brought forward to this time. Mr David Hicks (Question No. 5319) Mr Georganas asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 6 February 2007: In respect of Australian consular visits made to Mr David Hicks: (a) how many visits have been made; (b) what was the purpose of each visit; (c) how many of the visits were requested by Mr Hicks; (d) what were the positions and qualifications of the persons making each visit; (e) were any visits made by (i) a registered doctor, (ii) a registered psychologist or (iii) any other type of medical practitioner; (f) were consular officials accompanied by officers of United States authorities; if so, what were the positions of those officers; (g) were the visits otherwise supervised, monitored or recorded by United States authorities; (h) what conditions did United States authorities impose upon the visits; and (i) have any visits planned by Australian consular officials been denied by United States authorities. (a) Mr Hicks has been visited by Australian officials on 20 occasions since his detention in 2001 19 visits to Guantanamo Bay and once on the US Peleliu immediately after he was detained. (b) The purpose of the visits has changed over time, from an initial focus on security and law enforcement by relevant agencies to a focus purely on Mr Hicks’ welfare. On each occasion Mr Hicks’ welfare has been assessed. (c) None, however in common with standard practice DFAT consular officers have sought to visit Mr Hicks on a regular basis. (d) Since February 2004, 14 visits have been undertaken by the Consul-General, Australian Embassy Washington. There were six earlier visits undertaken by officials from security and law enforcement agencies and DFAT officials participated in two of the earlier visits. (e) No. (f) and (g) No. Consular officials have, on occasion, been accompanied by relevant officials from the US Department of Defense. However, since the start of 2005, consular officials have met with Mr Hicks alone. To our knowledge, consular visits to Mr Hicks have not been supervised, monitored or recorded by US authorities. (h) While some conditions consistent with a visit to a maximum security facility are imposed by US authorities, these conditions did not prevent us from undertaking our consular role. (i) No. Civil Aviation Safety Authority: Virgin Blue Flight DJ434 (Question No. 5324) Ms George asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 6 February 2007: (1) Is he aware of a serious incident that took place on a Virgin Blue Flight (DJ 434) from Perth to Sydney on 10 March 2005; if not, why not.",237,Questions In Writing
250,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Can he explain why there was no immediate and full inquiry into this serious incident. (3) Can he explain why there was a delay in investigating the matter; if not, why not. (4) Can he outline the Civil Aviation Safety Authority’s reporting requirements for notifying him of such incidents. (5) Is he aware that between January 2004 and April 2005 there were 32 formal complaints in respect of the over-consumption of alcohol on domestic flights; if so, what is his response, in the light of current concerns regarding airline security. (6) Does the Government plan to review Responsible Service of Alcohol provisions in relation to airline travel; if not, why not. (1) Yes. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has examined a passenger complaint about alleged loutish behaviour and excessive alcohol consumption on Virgin Blue Flight DJ434 on 10 March 2005. (2) I am advised that the allegation was investigated by Virgin Blue in April 2005 according to its internal procedures and the results reported to CASA. CASA advised that it also investigated the allegation and was satisfied that there was no safety issue involved and that the matter was handled appropriately by Virgin Blue. (3) There was no delay in investigating the matter. (4) CASA provides regular reports to the Minister on significant aviation safety related incidents and developments. Passenger complaints about alcohol consumption are usually managed by CASA and the relevant airline. (5) See (4) above. (6) CASA advises that an airline is required to hold a liquor license to enable it to serve alcohol. These are State licenses. The licensing regulations require the airline licensee to have a Responsible Service of Alcohol policy. The Australian Government does not intend to review the Responsible Service of Alcohol guidelines used by the airlines. Princes Highway (Question No. 5326) Ms George asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 6 February 2007: (1) What plans have been made to ensure that the entire Princes Highway from Sydney to Melbourne will be examined as part of the AusLink corridor strategy program. (2) Has the Department of Transport and Regional Services ascertained whether any part of the Princes Highway from Wollongong to Sale should be included in the next AusLink program. (3) What studies were undertaken, or are being undertaken, to enable an expansion of the AusLink network beyond Wollongong, southwards to Nowra and beyond. (4) What sections of the Princes Highway from Wollongong to Sale will be considered in the next AusLink program. (5) On what basis can sections of the Princes Highway south of Nowra to Lakes Entrance be considered in future AusLink programs beyond the next five-year or six-year program. (6) What measures can be taken to have a highway or regionally important road investigated for inclusion in the AusLink program and what significance is given to tourism in assessing the economic significance of a road or highway to a particular region.",238,Questions In Writing
251,Mr Vaile,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Sections of the Princes Highway between Sydney and Wollongong and between Melbourne and Sale are each on the defined AusLink National Network and are each examined in a corridor specific study. The Princes Highway between Wollongong and Sale is not part of the defined AusLink National Network; its contribution to traffic movements is considered in the Sydney-Melbourne corridor strategy. (2), (3), (4) The assessment of the extent to which the Princes Highway should be part of the AusLink National Network was made as part of the Government’s consideration of the extent of the Network in 2004. Parts of the road not declared to be on the Network remain the responsibility of the NSW and Victorian Governments. (5) and (6) AusLink includes four major programme elements. Only projects on the AusLink National Network can be funded as National Projects. The Australian Government has funded four projects on the Princes Highway under the AusLink Strategic Regional Programme: Princes Highway Safety Works ($15m); Pambula River Bridge ($5m); Batemans Bay Bypass ($10m); and Conjola Mountain Deviation ($10m). Corporatised Medical Practices (Question No. 5327) Ms George asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 6 February 2007: (1) What are the names of the publicly listed companies that operate corporatised medical practices.

(3) What is the total number and percentage of full-time equivalent general practitioners now working as employees of medical practices operated by the companies identified in Part (1). (1) The main publicly listed companies providing corporatised general practice services my department is aware of are Primary Health Care, Symbion Health (formerly Mayne Health) and Independent Practitioner Network. (2) This data is not collected by the Department of Health and Ageing. Under Medicare arrangements for general practice, the Commonwealth’s relationship is with individual providers. These arrangements do not take into account the organisational relationship under which medical practitioners work.

Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 5336) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 6 February 2007: (1) Prior to the privatisation of Sydney Airport, was it subject to price regulation in the form of price notification and price monitoring by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC); if so, did this price regulation include the regulation of prices notification for aeronautical services and monitoring of aeronautical-related services in the Prices Surveillance Act 1983. (2) In December 2000, prior to the expiration of the price caps for Sydney Airport, did the Commonwealth Government ask the Productivity Commission to inquire whether price regulation was required at privatised airports, one of which was Sydney Airport. (3) Did the Productivity Commission opt for a ‘light handed’ approach in its recommendations, recommending that price caps and prices notification arrangements at Sydney Airport should be replaced by a mandatory price monitoring arrangement for a probationary five year period. (4) On 13 May 2002, did he announce that the Government had accepted the Productivity Commission’s recommendations that Sydney Airport be subject to price monitoring for five years, effective from 1 July 2002. (5) On 13 May 2002, did he further announce that the new arrangements would not impact on regional airline operations into and out of Sydney and that regional airlines would continue to be guaranteed reasonable access to Sydney Airport under the slot management system and with a prohibition on any increases in aeronautical charges that exceed the Consumer Price Index. (6) Has he read the ACCC media statement titled ACCC Decision on Sydney Airport Prices (Release MR 110/01, 11 May 2001), which states that a decision was made to increase Sydney Airport Corporation Limited’s (SACL) aeronautical revenue in 2000-2001 from around $93 million to around $183 million, an increase of $90 million or 97 per cent, which compares to the increase sought by SACL of around 130 per cent. (7) Since privatisation, has the aeronautical revenue of Sydney Airport increased at a higher rate than the CPI; if so, by what sum for the period 2000 to 2006. (8) Can he confirm that any increase in aeronautical revenue being imposed on regional aircraft seeking to use Sydney Airport results in the financial exclusion of smaller and regional aircraft from Sydney Airport, thus denying such flights reasonable economic access to Sydney Airport; if not, why not. (9) Can he confirm that any increase in aeronautical charges at Sydney Airport will affect the purchase of slots at Sydney Airport and force airlines to choose Bankstown Airport instead; if not, why not. (10) Can he confirm that the current arrangement for airport pricing regulation at Sydney Airport means that Sydney Airport’s slot management system is now priced so that only large jet aircraft will be able to afford aeronautical charges at that airport, whilst regional flights will be priced out and hence compelled to use Bankstown airport; if not, why not. (1) Yes, this price regulation was authorised via Direction 15 and Direction 16 which were made pursuant to the then Price Surveillance Act 1983. (2) Yes. (3) Yes. (4) Yes. The Treasurer, the Honourable Peter Costello MP, and the then Deputy Prime Minister and Minster for Transport and Regional Services, the Honourable John Anderson MP, did make that announcement. (5) Yes. The then Deputy Prime Minister and Minster for Transport and Regional Services, the Honourable John Anderson MP, did make that announcement. (6) Yes. (7) Yes, by a small margin. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has used aeronautical revenue (adjusted) per passenger as the primary measure of aeronautical prices. Therefore, the answer here is based on the aeronautical revenue (adjusted) per passenger. In addition, as Sydney Airport was privatised on 25 June 2002, the appropriate period for comparison is from July 2002 to June 2006. According to the ACCC’s airports price monitoring and financial report 2005-06 (the ACCC’s 2005-06 report), over the period July 2002 to June 2006, aeronautical revenue per passenger excluding security (arising from Government-mandated security requirements) has increased by 13 per cent (see page 133 of the ACCC’s 2005-06 report). Over the same period, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 12.1 per cent (Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics, Longer Term Series: CPI All Groups, Weighted Average of Eight Capital Cities). This sees aeronautical revenue increasing only 0.9 per cent higher than the CPI. (8) No. As indicated in Question (5), regional airline operations into and out of Sydney are guaranteed reasonable access to Sydney Airport under the slot management system and with a prohibition on any increases in aeronautical charges that exceed the Consumer Price Index. (9) No. Slots are allocated, not purchased. Sydney’s slot management scheme is separated from airport pricing regulation at Sydney Airport. (10) No. See the answer for Question (9). Bankstown Airport (Question No. 5337) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 6 February 2007: Further to his reply to question No. 4817, what are the details of the international passenger aircraft that will be permitted to use Bankstown airport. Should Bankstown Airport wish to receive international operations either as charter or regular passenger services it would need to be designated as an international airport under the Air Navigation Act 1920 and establish the necessary border agency and security arrangements. The current Bankstown Airport Master Plan limits the capacity of the airport to code 3C aircraft such as the BAe146, Fokker F100, Airbus A318/319 and aircraft of a similar size.",241,Questions In Writing

256,Mr Vaile,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Healthy Eating (Question No. 5338) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 6 February 2007: Further to his reply to question No. 4083 that “junk food is often competitively priced”, can he confirm that this means junk food is cheaper than fresh food and vegetables; if not, why not. Food prices, as with other products and as in the case of other remote communities, vary across the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands in accordance with seasonal availability, power supply costs and competitive pricing practices. The Australian Government does not set prices and is constitutionally prohibited from price fixing. The government has established “Outback Stores”, a company that aims to reduce food costs and provide better quality food to remote communities. It will take a private sector approach to supporting Indigenous community stores that choose to participate. Mr David Hicks (Question No. 5344) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 6 February 2007: Further to his reply to Part (4) of question No. 4924, that “the Government has not sought Mr Hicks’ return to Australia”, will he explain why not. It has always been the Government’s position that Mr Hicks faced serious allegations and that he should face trial in relation to those allegations. On 30 March 2007 Mr Hicks was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment (6 years and 3 months of which was suspended) after he pleaded guilty to the charge of providing material support for terrorism. Mr Hicks has applied for a transfer to Australia to serve out his custodial sentence, in accordance with Australian legislation and the provisions of the prisoner transfer arrangement that Australia has in place with the United States. This application is being processed expeditiously. Mr David Hicks (Question No. 5345) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 6 February 2007: How does he reconcile the apparent inconsistency between (a) his statement to the Sydney Morning Herald on 15 August 2006, that he wanted fresh charges in place against Mr David Hicks “as soon as possible” and “were that not to be the case we would be seeking his [ Mr Hicks’] return in the same way we did with Mamdouh Habib” and (b) his reply to Part (4) of question No. 4924 that “the Government has not sought Mr Hicks’ return to Australia.” The Government’s position has always been that Mr Hicks should either be charged and face a military commission, which has happened, or be released and returned to Australia.

The Secretary-General of the OECD issued a media release on 18 January 2007 reporting on the consideration of this matter by the OECD Working Group on Bribery in International Business Transactions at its January 2007 meeting. On 14 March 2007, the OECD issued a second media release reflecting the outcome of the consideration of the matter at the Working Group’s March 2007 meeting. The media release of 14 March 2007 states that the Working Group ‘... maintains its serious concerns as to whether the decision was consistent with the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention’ and records the decision of the Working Group to conduct a supplementary review of the United Kingdom focused on progress in enacting a new foreign bribery law and in broadening the liability of legal persons for foreign bribery. The supplementary review will also examine whether systemic problems explain the lack of foreign bribery cases brought to prosecution as well as other matters raised in the context of the discontinuance of the BAE Al Yamamah investigation. The supplementary review will include an onsite visit to be conducted within one year. Both media releases are available at <http://www.oecd.org>.

The Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs administers a wide variety of programs to assist communities, many of which are routinely advertised and have quite comprehensive eligibility guidelines. I consider that the preparation of answers to these questions placed on notice would involve a significant diversion of resources and, in the circumstances, I do not consider that the additional work can be justified.

(2) In respect of the part of the report that quoted Mary Kostakidis, SBS television’s main newscaster and former member of SBS management, that “…in-program advertising means the SBS viewing experience is obviously going to change dramatically [and] there’s no doubt there’ll be commercial imperatives to make advertising slots increasingly lucrative…”, will the Minister explain how allowing in-program advertising will safeguard multilingual and multicultural broadcasts which reflect Australia’s multicultural society; if not, why not. (3) Will the Minister ensure that commercial imperatives, driven by increased advertising, will not result in a reduction in multilingual and multicultural SBS content which reflects Australia’s multicultural society; if so, how; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Minister is aware of the article. (2) Under the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991, it is the responsibility of the SBS Board to ensure that SBS acts in accordance with its Charter responsibilities. The Government notes that the SBS Board has directed management “to ensure the new regime is constructed so as to preserve the SBS viewing experience and be consistent with SBS’s Act and Charter”. The Board is also required to develop and publicise guidelines in relation to advertising and to include them in SBS’s Corporate Plan, explaining how this will contribute to the achievement of SBS’s objectives. (3) The Government has maintained the five minute cap on commercial advertising introduced by the previous Labor Government. As such, the Government does not anticipate any reduction in multilingual and multicultural SBS content. Internal SBS programming decisions are the responsibility of the SBS Board and Executive. Special Broadcasting Service (Question No. 5388) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 8 February 2007: (1) Can the Minister confirm that the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 contains a charter that describes the function of the SBS as providing “multilingual and multicultural radio and television services that inform, educate and entertain all Australians, and in doing so, reflect Australia’s multicultural society”; if not, why not. (2) Can the Minister ensure that SBS management is unable to pursue commercial imperatives to increase ratings, and through it advertising revenue, at the expense of niche programming which is multilingual and multicultural; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes.",256,Questions In Writing

Internal SBS programming decisions are the responsibility of the SBS Board and Executive. Special Broadcasting Service (Question No. 5389) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 8 February 2007: Can the Minister confirm that the SBS Charter within the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 does not impose duties on the SBS which are enforceable by proceedings in a court; if so, (a) will the Minister explain how compliance of SBS management with the terms of the SBS Charter is enforced and (b) will the Government amend the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 to allow proceedings to be brought in a court to enforce the SBS Charter; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Section6 of the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 provides for the SBS Charter. Section 6(4) provides that ‘nothing in this section imposes on the SBS a duty that is enforceable by proceedings in a court.’ (a) It is the responsibility of the SBS Board under Section9 of the SBS Act to ensure SBS performs its functions (The Charter) ‘in a proper, efficient and economical manner’. The SBS is subject to a range of accountability and governance measures to monitor its performance and compliance with the terms of its legislation and Charter. These measures include preparation of Corporate Plans, Annual Reports, Budget Statements, and appearances before Parliamentary Committees such as Senate Legislative Estimates Committees.

The Government formally exchanged notes with East Timor to bring CMATS and the International Unitisation Agreement for Greater Sunrise into force on 23 February 2007. I invoked the national interest exemption in order to bring CMATS into force before the usual period that treaties lie before Parliament expired. I wrote to Dr Andrew Southcott MP, Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, on 22 February 2007 to explain my reasons for invoking the national interest exemption for CMATS. My letter of 22 February 2007 was tabled in Parliament on 20 March 2007.

(2) On what date did a Parliamentary delegation from each of the countries listed in Part (1) most recently visit Australia. (3) In view of the growing importance to Australia of each of the countries listed in Part (1), and bearing in mind their large populations, will the Government consider sending an Australian Parliamentary delegation to each of those countries in the near future and invite a delegation from each of those countries to Australia. The Parliamentary Relations Office (PRO) at Parliament House manages the program of official outgoing and incoming parliamentary delegation visits. The PRO has provided the following information: (1) (a) An Australian parliamentary delegation, led by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, visited China from 7 to 15 April 2005.

282,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:lian Parliament’s Parliamentary Relations Office is awaiting confirmation from the Chinese that the visit will be proceeding. An invitation for a parliamentary delegation from Indonesia was renewed by the Presiding Officers in September 2006. The renewed invitation was delivered to the Indonesian Parliament by the Australian parliamentary delegation that visited Indonesia in September 2006. The Indonesian Parliament has expressed an interest in sending an official delegation to Australia in 2007 and is considering the most suitable dates for a visit. As parliamentary visits are arranged on a reciprocal basis, it is the turn of parliamentary delegations from India and Japan to visit Australia. Invitations for such visits have been issued and negotiations continue with the Indian and Japanese Parliaments on their availability to send delegations to Australia. Newstart Allowance (Question No. 5397) Mr Georganas asked the Minister representing the Minister for Human Services, in writing, on 12 February 2007: (1) Under what circumstances are Centrelink staff required to reject medical certificates that confirm a Newstart recipient’s inability to work, or look for work. (2) What medical qualifications do Centrelink staff hold to inform their rejection of medical certificates. (3) Does the rejection of medical certificates potentially expose Centrelink to legal repercussions if the rejection encourages a sick client to undertake activity that causes harm to the client or others. honourable member’s question: (1) Centrelink staff do not ‘reject’ medical certificates lodged by Newstart Allowance recipients. Centrelink may accept the treating doctor’s assessment that the person is temporarily incapacitated for all work, but may decide not to grant a temporary incapacity exemption because the person has been assessed as having capacity to participate in another suitable activity (such as the Personal Support Programme or Job Network). (2) Centrelink staff who assess medical certificates lodged by Newstart Allowance recipients are required to have appropriate expertise in: relevant parts of the Social Security Law; relevant policy guidelines, including the Guide to Social Security Law; determining what medical evidence (and other specialist evidence) is required by the Social Security Law and relevant policy in order to make a decision about an incapacity exemption; interpreting available medical evidence and specialist assessments such as Job Capacity Assessments; and brokering solutions that assist people towards participation. (3) No legal liability should arise where Centrelink has acted reasonably and in accordance with the Social Security Law.

283,Mr Brough,"The Minister for Human Services has provided the following answer to theTelevision Sports Broadcasts (Question No. 5398) Mr Georganas asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 12 February 2007: Having stated that the anti-siphoning list protects events of national importance and cultural significance, can the Minister explain to Australian soccer fans why games involving their international soccer team, the Socceroos, may not be screened on free-to-air television. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: In relation to soccer, the anti-siphoning list includes the English FA Cup Final and the 2010 FIFA World Cup finals tournament, including any matches in that tournament involving the Socceroos. SBS has already acquired exclusive free-to-air (FTA) television rights to the 2007 and 2008 English FA Cup Finals and the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, along with a number of FIFA competitions, including the FIFA Confederations Cup and the FIFA Women’s World Cup. The latter follows SBS’ successful coverage of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. In April 2006, the Football Federation Australia (FFA) announced a seven year, $150 million deal with Fox Sports involving subscription television coverage of all Socceroos home matches, the A-league domestic club competition, the Asian Confederation’s Champions League, the 2007 and 2011 Asian Cup tournaments, Asian Cup Qualifiers and selected World Cup qualification matches in 2008 and 2009. None of the events covered by the FFA/Fox Sports deal are on the anti-siphoning list, and in the past FTA coverage of Socceroos games has been inconsistent. The FFA has indicated that securing the long term security and stability of the game in Australia had been one of its primary objectives in entering into the deal with Fox Sports and that the funds obtained from the sale of the rights will be used to make substantial investments in national teams, in the national domestic competition and in the grassroots development of the game. Fuel Costs (Question No. 5399) Mr Georganas asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 12 February 2007: What was the disparity between the price of crude oil and the retail price paid by Australia consumers that resulted in Mr Graeme Samuel’s public call for the retail price of unleaded petrol to be reduced by 10 cents on 16 January 2007; and what price reduction was evident in the period immediately subsequent to 16 January that could not be attributable to any further decrease in the price of crude oil. Mr Samuel’s comments on 16 January 2007 regarding domestic petrol prices primarily related to the relationship between the price of petrol in Australia and the international benchmark petrol price for Singapore 95 unleaded, not the international price of crude oil as asserted in the question. Notwithstanding that, Mr Samuel observed that at that time, the movement in domestic petrol prices was not quite in correlation with movements in the international benchmark petrol price for Singapore 95 unleaded petrol. On 24 January 2007, the ACCC announced that domestic prices had moved back in line with the international benchmark, and noted that if a marked disparity occurred again, allowing for the time lag, it would comment publicly.",260,Questions In Writing

(2) In view of past fraud concerns relating to the misuse of travel entitlements by Members and Senators, why did the Government waive the requirement for Members and Senators to submit travel declarations in cases where Travel Allowance is not claimed. (1) As explained in the preamble to each document, while the tabled information comprises summary information, the supporting information, which is too bulky to be tabled, is available on written request to the Office of the Special Minister of State. (2) The Department of Finance and Administration’s circular No 2007/04 of 17 January 2007, to all Senators and Members, advised that the requirement to submit Travel Declarations when Travelling Allowance is not claimed was introduced prior to the implementation of tabling of all Parliamentarians’ travel costs and the certification of monthly management reports. Both these measures provide for greater transparency and accountability of travel entitlements than was achieved by the submission of Travel Declarations when Travelling Allowance was not claimed.

E-coli Infections (Question No. 5414) Mr Georganas asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 13 February 2007: Can he provide assurance that the current outbreak of e-coli in South Australia is not linked to the lower health, safety and quality standards of overseas-grown foods imported for the Australian consumer market; if not, why not. There is no evidence that the outbreak of E. coli infections in South Australia, during the months of January and February 2007, was related to imported foods. Extensive investigations by the South Australian Department of Health have not identified any association between the E. coli infections and a specific imported or domestically produced food. Furthermore, OzFoodNet, Australia’s national system for foodborne illness surveillance and investigation, has not shown any increase in the number of illnesses associated with imported produce. All locally produced and imported food must satisfy the requirements of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code, regarding a range of chemical and microbiological contaminants. Any food found to contain illegal levels of these contaminants is not permitted for sale. Since 1997, testing of imported fruit and vegetables by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has shown a high level of compliance with the requirements of the Food Standards Code.",263,Questions In Writing
