The situation arises partly from a shortage of heavy developmental equipment such as tractors, which are in very short supply in Australia. The amount of such machinery in the hands the Federal Government at present is very limited and most of it is being used to its'full capacity. It is quite possible that in some areas it may be possible to make some such arrangement as the it is possible to make Commonwealth Government equipment available to local governing bodies to any extent whatsoever I can assure the honourable gentleman that, in the public interest, it will be made.

Every country retains for itself the right to determine what persons shall be permitted to enter its territory That right constitutes the basis of our own immigration policy. Decisions to grant or reject -vises for travel in the United States of America are matters entirely within the competence of tbe American authorities. No self-respect could tolerate the imposition of a sanction of this kind against another country by any trade union acting entirely without responsibility or authority. The matter will be very closely examined by the Government. Is the Minister in order in reading his answer to the question? order. absence of the Minister for Health, I ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of the serious outbreak of poliomyelitis in South Australia and other States, which has reached alarming proportions and shows no signs of abatement, he will consider recommending to the Government that a special board of scientists be appointed to inquire into tbe possibility of discovering the origin of the disease and tbe most modern methods of treating -it. I ask this question in the belief that we in Australia have scientists equal to the world's best. We are advised to keep away from crowds, yet people who reside in the most remote parts of the country are affected by the disease. Minister for Health has been, directing a great deal of attention to this really dreadful problem. I shall bring the particular points made by the honourable member to his attention when I see him to-morrow. MR. A. M . McDONALD, M.P. represented in a section of the press. In the Sydney Morning Herald of Saturday, .the 22nd April, the following paragraph appears in a report of a debate in this House in connection with the sale of Hotel Ainslie tion? misrepresentation. The honourable member is in order. as follows:When the vote on the closure was being government with a shred of taken, Mr A. M. McDonald (Liberal, Victoria) walked out ot the House and did not take part. He did not return to vote in a second division on the formal motion to adjourn the House. you, Mr Speaker, whether there has been any alteration of the usual procedure in these matters. I 'suffered on one occasion as the result of a. ruling that personal explanations could be given only after the first 35 minutes of questions and answers had passed. I understood that tbe ruling still applied, and L want to know now whether tbe practice has been-changed. decision, Mr Speaker, I point out that the ruling mentioned by the honourable member for East Sydney was given by you on a previous occasion, when tbe practice was questioned by the honourable member for Melbourne. The honourable member for Melbourne said that he had been misrepresented and demanded the right to make a personal explanation immediately. That right was granted to him by you, sir, apparently varying the practice that has been mentioned by the honourable member for East Sydney. The reason for that variation, however, was that a personal explanation should be made immediately after the occurrence of the misrepresentation. The practice of deferring personal explanations until the expiration of a period of 35 minutes after the commencement of a sitting applies if the misrepresentation has taken place at another time, in which event tbe requirements of the Standing Orders cannot be fulfilled by the making of an immediate personal explanation. In euch instances, the practice is to allow personal explanations to be made after a period of 35 minutes of question time bat",13,Shipping

I rule that the honourable member for Corangamite is in order. Speaker. You referred only to the New South Wales. IfI do have the incident mentioned by the honourable opportunity of speaking to him I shall member for Perth. In the matter that I inform him that while he and I take a spoke about, the misrepresentation of serious view of inflation, its outstanding which I had complained had occurred champion in this House is the honourable in the press. The circumstances in that member for East Sydney. case and in the present case of the honourable member for Corangamite were identical, and at that time. I was refused permission to make my personal explanation until after the first 35 minutes of question time had expired. that occasion but I can look it up. Howdrawn to a reported statement by Mr ever, I have ruled that the honourable E. H . Graham, the New South Wales member for Corangamite is in order. that I have read is as fantastic as it is Government with a request that it waive false. I voted for the closure, as the customs duty on all imported fencing records of the proceedings in this House materials required for the repair of floodon the 21st April will show. I have been damaged fences? Is it not a fact that under the mistaken impression that the this Government some time ago removed function of a reputable newspaper with customs duties from fencing materials? a large circulation is to impart information with knowledge, accuracy and courtesy.

In view of this alarming and constant increase in prices, will the Prime Minister arrange for a referendum to be held on the question of transferring prices control back to the Australian Government where it proved effective and beneficial ? of the honourable member's questions is in the negative. Minister for External Affairs relates particularly to the importance of international affairs, and is prompted by my belief that the House should be furnished with up-to-date information on those matters. Has the Minister considered the advisability of inaugurating a system whereby brief reports on international affairs would be made available regularly to the Parliament ? consider the question which has been asked by the honourable member for St. George, but, as he knows, the business of the House is controlled in a certain way, and it is not always easy to interpose the subject of international affairs. When I reply to the debate on international affairs, I hope to bring forward up-to-date information, which I am sure will be of importance to the House. I shall accede to the request by the honourable gentleman on future occasions, as frequently as I can. MR. E . V . ELLIOTT . for Immigration read the announcement in the press a few days ago to the effect that the Communist secretary of the Seamen's Union, MrE . V . Elliott, was about to leave Australia for the purpose of attending an industrial conference overseas? Is Mr Elliott travelling with the -concurrence of the Minister? If so, is Works and Housing inform me when the that to be taken as an indication that construction of the new wharf at Darwin the protestations of members of the will be proceeded with? I remind him Liberal party and the Australian Country party, when they were in Opposition, against the granting of permits to Communists to enable them to travel abroad, were humbug? the effect that Mr Elliott is seeking to go abroad, and I imagine that, as a prominent member of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which is a Communist controlled industrial organization, he would be travelling for purposes connected with that body. The honourable member for Werriwa has used the words ""about to leave Australia"". I understand that, at the moment, Mr Elliott finds himself in that situation. He has sought to obtain a transit visa through permission has not been granted to him. So far as I am aware, he has not obtained travel rights through any other country. I understand that Mr Elliott possesses a passport which was issued to him during the term of the previous Government, of which the honourable member for Werriwa was a supporter. Apart from that, I have no other knowledge of the matter. I shall be happy to COMPULSO RY MILITAR Y policy in respect of the possible introduction of compulsory military training in the near future, will the Minister acting for the Minister for Defence give consideration to providing some distinction between those who have already enlisted voluntarily in the armed forces, and those who are called up under the compulsory system? Apart from a distinction in regard to badges, &c, will he ensure that those who are already serving voluntarily shall be placed on a footing in the enlarged forces which will demonstrate in a practical manner the national recognition of their services? consider the matters which the honourable member has mentioned.",15,Flood Damage

In view of all those facts, will the Minister treat the matter as urgent ? wharf at Darwin has fallen down lately. I shall he glad to obtain particulars regarding the matter from my department and to supply the honourable gentleman with the information that he seeks. ter consider making arrangements with the Public Service Board to restrict appointments to the staff of the Repatriation Commission to ex-service personnel only, whilst still leaving the avenues for promotion to other branches of the Public Service open to the staff of the Repatriation Commission? My question arises from an appointment that was made to the staff of the Repatriation Commission at Brisbane. Whilst no reflection is cast upon the service or efficiency of the appointee, ex-service organizations would appreciate consideration being given to this matter. to discuss the particular case mentioned by the honourable member with my colleague the Minister for Repatriation. for National Development say whether it is a. fact that he flew over portion of northern Queensland last week-end, ostensibly to look at the Tully Falls and other areas where the Queensland Labour Government proposes to develop hydro-electric power? If so, was that flight an effort to restore the fallen prestige of this Government that has resulted from its repudiation of the Chifley Government's decision to pay half the cost of the Burdekin Valley development scheme inaugurated by the Queensland Government? Was the flight also designed to create the impression on the eve of the Queensland State elections that the Australian Government is interested in parts of Australia other than the capital cities of Sydney and Melbourne. the honourable gentleman for raising this matter. During the last long week-end I paid a visit to Queensland to inspect a number of potential developmental I understand that the areas, as indeed I have been in the habit of doing for some considerable time and will continue to do. I saw the Herbert,, the Tully, and the Mareeba areas, the last of which is a potential site for an irrigation scheme, and a number of other areas to the south, including the Burdekin area. The Australian Government on numerous occasions, through the mouth of the present Prime Minister, has expressed its determination to assist in the development of the, at present,, grossly undeveloped northern Queensland area. It persists in that intention, because the population of Queensland, and northern Queensland in particular, has been almost stationary for a generation, which is a very dangerous condition. The Government is determined toco-operate with the Queensland Government in the development of that area in respect of schemes that are proven to be worthwhile in the public interest. That position has not yet been reached in relation to the Burdekin Valley scheme. TheI shall be very glad Queensland Government has not yet produced the basic evidence to warrant the co-operation of the Australian Government in a scheme that is expected to cost between £30,000,000 and £40,000,000, and possibly even more. The situation is perfectly simple. As soon as theQueensland Government has established the basic, common sense facts that arerequired by this Government and would be needed by any other Government to warrant an expenditure of anything approaching the sum that I havementioned, this Government will give its most sympathetic consideration to the question of co-operating with the Queensland Government in the matter. The Premier of Queensland has introduced party politics into the Burdekin Valley scheme, which is a very deplorable action. Politics has nothing to dowith national development. The Australian Government is only too anxious-",16,Darwin Wharf

37,Mr Casey,"I am very grateful to to co-operate with the Queensland Government, of whatever political, colour it may be, and as soon as the basic facts are determined it will be a.ble to make a decision in the matter. for National Development say whether any request has been made by the Government to the State governments that those governments organize their respective States into developmental regions for the purpose of more effectively planning for national development? If so, what action has the Queensland Government taken to co-operate with the Australian Government in respect of such a request? ment propounded a proposal to all State governments that each State should bo divided into regional developmental areas and that those areas should be controlled by councils consisting of local men who, on the basis of their local knowledge, would report to their respective State governments and through them to the Commonwealth Government upon the potentialities of each area. The Queensland Government has not responded at all to that proposal. So far as I am aware that Government, and certainly the Australian Government, have not had before them any proposals for the creation of regional developmental areas in Queensland, nor has the Australian Government received any regional reports from Queensland. It would be of tremendous advantage not only to regions of the State concerned but also to the State Government and, particularly, the Australian Government to have regional developmental councils created and have them report through the State Government to the Australian Government. I am grateful to the honourable member for having raised this matter, and I can only express the hope that Queensland will reform itself in this respect and create these regional developmental councils. SAL E OF HOTEL AINSLIE . for the Interior to tell me the amount of the purchase of Callide coal, and I believe the licence-fee that was payable by the that the South Australian Government Hotel Ainslie in respect of its last year of has done likewise. The Callide coal operations ? mation at hand, but I shall obtain it and supply it to the honourable member. Minister for the Interior a question which arises out of remarks attributed to the honourable member for Gellibrand in the current issue of the Canberra Times. I should like to ask the Ministermay not be based on newspaper reports. The honourable member may speak on the subject on the adjournment to-night. COAL. ments that were made yesterday by the Queensland Minister for Mines, Mr Moore> regarding the supply of Queensland coal to southern States, can the Minister for National Development inform the House whether, last year, the Queensland Labour Government broke its contract with the Victorian Government for the supply of Callide coal? Is the right honourable gentleman of opinion that the bad state of the road from Callide to Gladstone as well as the royalties and road haulage charges imposed by the Queensland Government are retarding the development of the Callide field ? Does the payment of Commonwealth subsidy on coal at present being imported from overseas by Victoria and South Australia mean, as Mr Moore claimed, that no outlet exists for any surplus of Queensland coal? market in Brisbane there is a potential market for Callide coal in Victoria and South Australia and, possibly, in due course, in other places. The saleability of coal invariably involves quality and cost. The Victorian Government obtained a shipment of Callide coal a few months ago in order to test it for quality, and that shipment proved to be of very poor quality indeed. The quality was so poor that I do not believe that that shipment is typical of Callide coal. As the result of that experience the Victorian Governdeposit is a great national asset and should",17,National Development

However, at the moment, it is up to the Queensland Government to ensure that the coal can be delivered at Gladstone, and what is more important still, at Victorian ports, at a reasonable and competitive price. I, personally, have no doubt about the quality of Callide coal. The Australian Government is interested in the Callide field and in justifiable circumstances would be ready and willing to assist in its development; but the next move in this matter rests with the Queensland Government, which must ensure that coal of the right quality is produced and at reasonable cost. The Queensland Government has a large say in respect of cost, because at present it is levying a toll of os. a ton on all coal delivered from Callide to Gladstone, which is the nearest port to the field. If the Queensland Government doe.s its part, I have no doubt that the Australian Government will act as its honest broker in this matter. It may, perhaps, even go further and assist the project generally. ter for National Development inform the House whether it is a fact that there are enormous deposits of high quality seam coal in the Burragorang Valley within 60 miles of Sydney, and that this coal could be immediately brought into production by the holders of some small adjacent leases who are at present working a very limited field? Is it a fact that this coal is being withheld from the public by the New South Wales Government, awaiting some action in the dim and distant future ? Is it a fact that if negotiations with the New South Wales Government resulted in the granting of permission to work this coal tomorrow morning, the output of the mines in the Burragorang Valley could be tremendously increased? Will the Minister take this matter up with the -Joint Coal Board and the New South Wales Government or will it be necessary to wait until that Government is wiped out? honourable gentleman has so very truthfully and usefully written in the public press about the Burragorang coal deposit, and I shall be very glad to collaborate with the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport in respect of the matter raised. [«5] The last matter mentioned by the honourable member is a possibility that is always in the background. ago I asked the Prime Minister whether it was the intention of the Government to introduce legislation to increase the rate of pensions paid to aged and invalid persons. The right honourable gentleman then informed me that no consideration had been given to the matter. I now ask him whether the Government has since considered it. If it has done so, what decision has been reached? If not, if there any probability that it will do something in this direction during the preseni sittings of the Parliament? been under investigation in the Department of Social Services and, in due course, will come before Cabinet.

If so, has any proposal emanated from the discussion! If such a discussion has not been held, when does the Minister propose to discuss the matter with the board? some little time ago in the Parliament and the text of the question then asked was brought to the notice of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board.

As the problem is too great to be handled by individuals or local government organizations, and yet is of vital importance to food production, will the Minister consider having an immediate nationwide survey of the problem of soil erosion made in order to evolve a scheme to deal with it effectively in conjunction with State and local government bodies. Ms. Government is very well aware that recent rains, particularly in the eastern Statea of Australia, have increased the degree of soil' erosion.

Will the Minister make as broad a statement as possible on these very important subjects, as was the habit of the honourable member for East Sydney when he was Minister for External Territories? to give to the House a full statement as soon as the Opposition gives me a chance to do so and I shall deal with the important matters that the honourable member has mentioned. I remark that honourable members of the Opposition are occupying most of the sitting time of the House with discussions of the Commonwealth BankB ill and other legislation. I do not know when it will be possible for me to make a comprehensive statement because of the heavy legislative programme of the Government, but I shall avail myself of the first opportunity to do so. Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) -by leave I take this opportunity to make a short statement about displaced persons in order to correct a misinterpretation of Government policy that has apparently arisen from a reply that I gave yesterday to a question that was asked in this House. The question related to a statement that had been made by an officer of the International Refugee Organization who travelled on a ship that brought immigrants to Australia, and in reply to it I gave some details of the numbers I ask tbe Minister of displaced persons who were to be brought to Australia under the Government's programme for 1950. PerhapsI did not explain the situation with in several newspapers my statement has been interpreted as though the Government had decided suddenly to make a substantial reduction of the programme for the introduction of displaced persons fairly well understood by honourable members but, in view of the misunderstanding that may develop in other parts of the world as the result of the newspaper statements, I consider that I should clarify the situation at this stage. There has been no change of the Government's plan for the introduction of displaced persons this year. In January, I announced on behalf of the Government that the immigration programme for the year contemplated the introduction of 200,000 persons, of whom 50,000 would be displaced persons. That number has not been amended. ment increased its total? not been increased. The previous Government undertook a firm commitment with the International Refugee Organization, as I understand the facts, for the introduction into Australia of 110,000 displaced persons. By the end of 1949, approximately 87,000 of those persons had come to Australia, leaving a balance of 23,000 to be brought here under that programme. 1950. member for Melbourne, as Minister for",21,Surveyors

72,Mr Holt,"Yes. The honorableImmigration in the previous Government, had given an indication shortly before the general election last year that his Government would favourably consider the introduction of an additional 100,000 displaced persons. This Government decided at the beginning of 1950 that it wanted to bring to Australia a larger proportion of British immigrants than had been contemplated by the previous Government. Having regard to accommodation difficulties and other problems, it considered that a substantial reduction of the second batch of 100,000 displaced persons that had been planned by the previous Government would be necessary. Therefore, our plan provided for the introduction of the remaining 23,000 displaced persons in the original programme of 110,000 and an additional 27,000 displaced persons, t<. make a total of 50,000 for the year. That programme is being carried out and no reduction of the number is contemplated. It may be of interest to honourable members to know that almost 120,000 displaced persons have already come to Australia, leaving a balance of approximately 17,000 needed to complete the programme that this Government announced at the beginning of the year. Most of the 17,000 are actually on the water at present. This means that, in the second half of the year, opportunities will be available to us to increase the -number of British immigrants very substantially. That is what we have planned to do. The Government's decision does not mean that the programme for the introduction of displaced persons has been fully closed. However, that is a matter of policy that has yet to be considerei by the Government, and it will be affected to some degree by the practicability of bringing to Australia this year the total number of 100,000 British immigrant! that was previously announced. I do not disagree with anything that the Minister for Immigration has said, but I emphasize that, when he took office, the honourable gentleman said that he would bring to Australia this year 100,000 British immigrants and 100,000 other people as well-no t only displaced persons, but also those who would come here on landing permits. Such permits are issued to relatives and friends in Australia who guarantee to pay the fares of migrants to this country and to accommodate them upon arrival. I thank the honourable member for Parke3 ( Mr Haylen) for reminding us of our obligations to bring in Dutch ex-servicemen who desire to come to this country. They belong to one of the progressive races of the western world. The Dutch, Italians and Poles are the only peoples who are really making any contribution to posterity for Western civilization. For many reasons we should be glad to have such migrants. I think that t a Minister1 t.advertently omitted to say, in outlining his prcgr-Jinme for 100,000 British migrants this year, that he thought he might be able to get 20,000 more berths iroin the British shipping companies than I wa? able to obtain. At a conference held in 1947 in the Dorchester Hotel, London, I was able to arrange for 80,000 berths this year and 81,000 next year. The Minister, in his desire to bring more British migrants to this country, which I share, a.nd which I should be glad to see fulfilled, undertook to bring more immigrants in than he could arrange to have brought in. IfI could not get the necessary berths I am certain that he could not do so, because they are simply not available. They are not available because, although 21,000,000 tons of British shipping existed at the beginning of World War II., at the end of hostilities only 7,500,000 tons remained afloat. Although the Minister has tried to emphasize the importance of bringing out more people he has been forced by physical circumstances, and by his inability to arrange more British shipping for the purpose, to bring here more displaced person migrants. The impression created by the statement he made yesterday was unfortunate, but was of his own making. That impression was that the Minister did not want all the displaced person migrants that it might be possible for this country to obtain. I think that we should get all who are available of those good people, and get them while we can, because next year",22,Immigration

He has graciously given his consent to that. to ask a question about the matter of photographers ? over, hut the honourable gentleman may ask a question. may remember that while I occupied the Speaker's ChairI prohibited the photographing of people about the corridors and other parts of the building because of certain occurrences. I permitted photography only at a given time inside the House, after consultation with party leaders. I have noticed a number of photographers, apparently ready to shoot at anything, walking around the corridors of this building, and I am wondering whether the restriction that I imposed has been eased or whether the photographers have asked for permission generally to shoot whatever they like about the building. made to me for permission to take photographs inside this building, and as far as I know the rule that the honourable member mentioned has not been broken.

The plans of the proposal are tabled herewith. Question resolved in the affirmative. BILL 1930. In committee: Consideration resumed from the 26th April (vide page 1904). Clause 7-Proposed section 9A (Difference of opinion between Government and bank on questions of policy). of the Opposition) [3.33] -The provisions outlined in proposed section 9A endorse the view of the previous Government as embodied in the 1945 legislation, that the Government should have the last say in the general financial policy to be adopted by the bank. It was always understood quite clearly that that did not relate to any of the administrative functions of the bank. No attempt has been made by governments, during the time the legislation has been in operation, or even when the economic security regulations were operating, to interfere with the administrative functions of the bank. This particular provision in the 1945 legislation relates only to the question of general overall economic and financial policy. I now direct attention to another remarkable matter. The Liberal party and the Australian Country party when in Opposition, objected strongly to the provision under which the Government, through the Treasurer, had power to overrule the bank. All the talk which we have heard about the Treasurer being a dictator is so much eyewash. He is the agent of the Government, and is controlled by Cabinet, and, no doubt, by his own party. He acts only as an agent for the Government. The present Government has completely endorsed a principle to which the Liberal party and the Australian Country party took strong exception when they were in Opposition in 1945, and that is that the Government should have the final say in determining overall financial policy, and, when a disagreement occurs between the Government and the bank, the Treasurer, on behalf of the Government, may give a direction to the bank upon general banking policy. ' I do not object to that fundamental principle, because the Labour party incorporated it in our banking legislation. The matter to which I want to direct attention is the fact that the Government has drafted this proposed section in an attempt to delude the public into believing that the Parliament has the final say in giving a direction to the bank upon general financial policy. That is not the position. As I stated in my second-reading speech, this proposed new section does not give the Parliament any power to upset a decision which may be made by the Treasurer, on behalf of the Government, and which is conveyed to the bank. This provision is camouflage and means absolutely nothing, except that it states that the Parliament shall be given information about what has been done. It is perfectly true that the Opposition may move the adjournment of the House to discuss a particular matter relative to a financial decision, but an order in council by the Executive Council cannot be disallowed by the Parliament. When I dealt with that position in my second-reading speech, the Prime Minister interjected to the effect that I had not read the bill. The inference to be drawn from the right honourable gentleman's remark was that the position was not as I had stated it to be, but it is clear that the fact that an Executive minute is laid on the table does not mean that it can be disallowed by either House of the Parliament. I am not asking that the House of Representatives and the Senate should be given such a power in this matter. I am merely pointing out that this provision is purely cfimouflage for the benefit of the public. The Government is attempting to deceive the people into believing that the Parliament hae &e last say in determining",24,Reference To Public Works Committee
85,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Leade rfinancial policy. It has nothing of the kind. This provision can be very mischievous. I have heard a good deal of talk about the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, Dr. Coombs, but I remind the committee that he has not occupied that position ever since the Commonwealth Bank Act came into operation in 1945. Mr Armitage was Governor of the bank for a part of that time, and I, as Treasurer, did not on any occasion find need to overrule the bank on any general economic and financial policy. When I use the words, "" I, as Treasurer"", I really mean the government of the day, because the Treasurer is only acting as an agent for the Government. As I have stated, that provision can be very mischievous, because, in effect, it compels the Government to lay on the table all the correspondence relative to a disagreement between it and the Governor or board of the Commonwealth Bank. I cannot imagine anything more disturbing to the financial and economic stability of the country than such a procedure. If the Opposition were to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a matter in dispute between the Government and the bank, an acrimonious discussion might develop on what had been written between the two parties. I cannot imagine anything more foolish than that, and I believe that the Treasurer recognizes it. The Government and the Governor of the bank may have many discussions and exchange a number of letters about financial policy, and the tabling of those documents in the House may allow people to misconstrue what has been written and make all kinds of allegations and charges on matters mentioned in the correspondence. Such a provision is highly mischievous and entirely foolish, and the committee should delete it. ment considers that certain matters between it and the bank are in dispute and are causing some public unrest, it has authority, under the exifting act, to introduce the subject by a statement to the Parliament. But the present provision is simply camouflage, and the only effect, of it will be to compel the Government to lay on the table correspondence that has passed between the Treasurer and the bank. Mr Chifley. to letters? provides for a statement. statement be in the circumstances which we are discussing? correspondence and letters? Treasurer, on behalf of the Government, convey information to the bank? Would he not send, to the Governor a letter that he, as Treasurer, had signed on behalf of the Government? I say quite frankly that I have not heard a more stupid observation than that of the Minister for Supply( Mr Beale), since this bill was introduced. How would the Governor of the bank be informed of the Government's views by any way other than by a letter signed by the Treasurer, or statements sent by him? How could the Governor of the bank compile a statement for consideration by the Government about a matter if he did not sign it in his official capacity? SurelyI am justified in describing such correspondence and statements as letters. sition called them letters. statements, if that will please the Minister. Or shall I describe them as an exchiinge of communications between the Government and the Governor of the bank? The Minister may place his own interpretation upon them, but the documents would have to be signed either by the Treasurer on behalf of the Government or by the Governor on behalf of the bank. If the GovernLeader of the Opposition has exhausted his time. I support the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley). Under this provision, the position of the Treasurer is unchanged in relation to the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945. If this provision becomes law the Treasurer of the day, whoever he is, may still, as he can under the 1945 legislation, direct the bank upon the financial policy.

I do not believe that it will, and I do not believe that the Government should continue to pretend that it will. The National Rank of Australasia very kindly sent me a copy of its annual report, according to which the chairman of the bank, in his address to the annual meeting of the shareholders on the 30th -November, 1949, saidWe believe that, democratically, it is wrong fyhiit vast powers over the financial system -should be so largely vested in the hands of the ^Federal Treasurer of the day. The present measure will not deprive ""the Treasurer of any of the vast powers that we gave the Treasurer of the day iBiader the 1945 act. That is an important -point for the committee to consider. Honourable members opposite say, in effect, "" Forget about the bill. It really does not do anything to change vitally the present structure laid down under the 1945 act. So why worry about it? Why not allow the board to be established and to make its mistakes, and allow the Treasurer, whether he is Labour or anti-Labour, to continue to direct it ? "" In the final analysis the Treasurer has the say and the board acts only as an advisory committee. After all, the board is administrative, and executive, but it is not the final determiner of government policy. The power remains where the Chifley Government put it-in the hands of the Treasurer of the day. I believe that system to be democratically right. I believe that financial policy, like defence policy and fiscal policy, is the sole prerogative of the elected representatives of the people to determine and should be determined by nobody else. member agrees with the proposed new section ? it, because I consider that it embodies a lot of humbug and pretence. It pretends to give to the Parliament something which it does not give to it at all. I have previously said to honourable members opposite that if we desire an effective system of parliamentary control over the bank board we should adopt the Swedish system, in which a committee of the Parliament governs the State bank board. The government of the day has a majoiiity of the membership of that, committee, which, like every other parliamentary committee, is subject to the decision of the Parliament. If the Government had advanced a scheme such as thar I could understaand that some semblance of parliamentary control was intended. But the parliamentary system of government provides for a legislature, an executive and a judiciary. The Parliament elects the Executive and the Executive controls the administrative and Executive arms of government. It is impossible to mix the two arms of government in the way that the Government is suggesting. This measure will still give the final say to the Treasurer of the day, whoever he isand we shall be back in office in a year or so and be doing what we want to do in the matter of directing the policy of the Commonwealth Bank, despite what the proposed Commonwealth Bank Board might say. If the bill is passed in its present form it will have done nothing to destroy our power and opportunity to do what we desire to do when we are returned to office. Honourable members opposite therefore should take notice of what the former Treasurer has said and not persist in asking for something that can involve the laying on the table of the House of papers and documents the tabling of which could harm the Commonwealth Bank. If honourable members opposite desire to have papers and documents produced to the Parliament in the event of a disagreement, why do they not desire to have the whole of the minutes of the bank board tabled here so that any honourable member can disagree, at any time, with anything that the board has done ? Or why not lay the papers on the the honourable table of the Library, so that all the information relative to meetings of the bank board could be considered. honourable gentleman has exhausted his time. for Supply) [3.53] I do not think that I have ever heard the former Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) speak in a less convincing fashion than that in which he spoke ten minutes ago.

109,Mr Beale (Parramatta,"Ministe rbe gives his blessing to all of the proposed new section 9 A except the proposed new sub-section (7.). Of course, he has to Jo that because, as he has been forced to admit most of the sub-sections of the proposed new section 9A, other than subsection (7.), have been taken substantially, or entirely, from the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945. Let us consider sub-section (1.) of the proposed new section 9A, which readsThe Bank shall, from time to time, inform the Government of the monetary and banking policy of the Bank. With certain immaterial variations, that is the same provision as is contained in section 9 of the 1945 act. Sub-section (2.) of the proposed new section 9A readsIn the event of H difference of opinion between the Government and the Bank as to whether the monetary and banking policy of the Bank is directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia, the Treasurer and the Board shall endeavour to reach agreement. That also is substantially the same as the provision in the 1945 act and, of course, is a matter of common sense. A great banking institution avoids disputes and wranglings if it ca,n possibly do so; and the Treasurer of the day and the controllers of the bank, if they have a proper sense of their responsibilities, w ill attempt, first and foremost, to reach agreement. This proposal provides for the settlement of differences of opinion, and I am pleased to note that the Opposition gives its blessing to that provision. Another sub-section of the proposed section provides that if the Government and the bank f a i l to reach agreement on differences of opinion on questions of policy the board shall forthwith furnish to the Treasurer a statement in relation to the matter in respect of which the difference of opinion has arisen, and the Treasurer may submit a recommendation on the subject to the Governor General as the result of which the Government will determine the policy that shall be followed. If such discussions do not result in agreement, by compromise or in any other way, that is, if the difference is irreconcilable, the Government must take the responsibility for determining the matter. That provision is similar to a provision that was included in the legislation passed in 1945. But, honourable members opposite want to stop there; they want that to be the end of the matter. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) has said that publicity should not be given to such differences and, consequently, no opportunity should be given to the people of Australia to form an opinion on matters in dispute, which, in the circumstances, must be vital matters of banking and monetary policy. Therefore, in respect of sub-section (7.) of the proposed section honourable members opposite pour the vials of their wrath upon the Government. It is little wonder that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Chifley) is obliged to give his approval to all of the sub-sections, except sub-section (7.), of the proposed section, becausethese provisions were not only included,, in substance, in the Banking Act of 1945but were also endorsed in the report of theBoyal Commission on Monetary and! Banking Systems of which the right honourable gentleman was a member, and he.' concurred with that report in respect of the settlement of differences arising between the Government and the bank. Although the members of that commission thought that, in practice, great differences would be reconciled, they stated in paragraph 530 of their reportThe Federal Parliament is ultimately responsible for monetairy policy and the Government of the day is the executive of the Parliament. [Quorum formed.'] I repeat that it is little wonder that the Leader of the Opposition finds himself in a difficulty about the bill because being in opposition he believes, I suppose, that it is his duty to oppose, but, at the same time he was obliged to give his approval to each sub-section, except sub-section (7.), of the proposed section, first, because those sub-sections have been copied largely from the legislation that his own Government passed in 1945; and, secondly, because the Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Systems in paragraph 530 of its report to which he subscribed, made the statement that I have just read. The only difference between the Government and the Opposition on the proposed section narrows down to sub-section (7.) which reads"" The Treasurer shall cause to be laid before each House of the Parliament, within fifteen sitting days of that House after the Treasurer has informed the bank of the policy determined under sub-section (4.) of this section(u) a copy of the order determining its policy; (6) a statement by the Government in relation to the matter in respect of which the difference of opinion arose; and (o) a copy of the statement furnished to the Treasurer by the Board under sub-section (3.) of this section. When dealing with this matter this afternoon the Leader of the Opposition was less convincing than I have heard him previously. Labouring at his oar he said that the provision was unnecessary and insincere. I do not know whether he contends that the provision should not be made at all, or that it does not go far enough, because he did not quite clarify his own mind, or our minds, on the matter. But the honourable member for Melbourne attempted to clarify the matter. So far as I was able to understand his argument it was that this provision was not contained in the 1945 legislation, apparently because it was not necessary as the Government must determine monetary policy; but now that it is included in the bill, it does not go far enough. the Minister claims it does. provision means. First, it makes proof the House to initiate a discussion. vision for something that the Chifley Government did not provide for. It provides for the light of day to be thrown then pointedly submit a motion, "" That upon disputes that may arise between the the question be now p u t "" . Government and the Commonwealth Bank in respect of fundamental matters of banking and monetary policy which may affect the welfare of thousands of Opposition members from speaking, but citizens. Should an irreconcilable tussle I do not include the honourable member occur between the bank and the Governfor Perth( Mr Tom Burke) in that ment, on which there must be a final category. arbiter, the Parliament shall be given the opportunity to learn of the existence of witty remark. the struggle. Sub-section (7.) provides for that contingency in the only way possible on the premises of the Opposition's arguments, by enacting that the Parliament shall be acquainted with the all of us when we are faced by arguments facts. porters of the present Government say on this matter during the recent general election campaign? Parliament should be f u l ly informed of such matters. Interjections of the kind just made by the honourable member are rather peculiar, because honourable members opposite are saying, in effect, that the Government is not doing precisely what its leader promised -to do in his policy speech at the recent general election; yet, in the same breath, they object to the Government doing anything at all. They say that sub-section (7.) of the proposed section should not be included in the measure. They cannot have it both ways. Let us consider what courses will be open to the Parliament if it is informed that a dispute has arisen between the board and the Government in relation to a matter of high policy. Quite apart from initiating a discussion hy submitting a formal motion for the adjournment of the House, Opposition members could submit a motion of want of confidence in the Government and so arrange for a f u l l discussion of the matter. If they believed that the difference was profoundly important, and that the decision of the board had been right and the Treasurer wrong, they could propose a motion of censure of the It does not do what Government.

119,Did The Sup,"The CHAIRMAN. Order ! I asking to show is that we have introduced an innovation which is designed to allow the people to know all the facts of a dispute between the board and the Government when such a matter is regarded as of fundamental importance. We do not anticipate that such a dispute will arise. to the character of the board the Government has in mind, that is a foregone conclusion. history has shown that governments are prepared to accept compromises and that boards of responsible men are prepared to acquiesce in the decision of the Government on matters of policy. The provision to which so much exception has been taken was inserted in the measure merely to cover the contingency if such a dispute should arise. We believe that should such a dispute arise the people should know the facts and that the Parliament should have an opportunity to express its views upon them. What more democratic process could be provided? A fundamental difference on a matter of policy which might affect the lives of the people should be brought before this national forum which is the only place where'the voice of the people can be effectively expressed. I do not think that the heart of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) was in the argument which he presented. Perhaps that is why he left the chamber as soon as he had completed his speech. extraordinary reason honourable members opposite think that we should not oppose the provisions of proposed new section 9A. They claim that the proposals in it do not alter in any material way the state of affairs that exists under the legislation now in force. I suggest that, in fact, a radical departure is 'being made from the existing legislation and that members of the Australian Labour party would be recreant to their trust if they did not draw attention to the extent of that departure. examination, the provisions of this proposed new section are seen to be cumbersome, unwieldy and ambiguous, and, in some respects, they will be unworkable. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that these proposals have been brought before the Parliament for the purpose of hoodwinking the people into believing that the utmost democratic control of the Commonwealth Bank will be exercised by the Commonwealth Bank Board of the future. In my opinion, therefore, they are a sham and a delusion. The provisions of this proposed new section will give to the Government a splendid opportunity to transfer to the board responsibility for In almost all instances any unpopular decision which the Government may be called upon to make in relation to banking policy. For example, the Government, with a board, the majority of the members of which are of its own political complexion, could stage a sham fisht while awaiting the decision of the Parliament on a matter in dispute which had been referred to the Parliament. While the dispute is under consideration in the Parliament the board could proceed to act against the interests of the people. The provisions of the proposed new section will present the Government with a unique opportunity to get out from under and throw full responsibility on a board which will not be answerable to the people. Many months may elapse before a fundamental difference between the Government and the board reaches finality. The Minister for Supply( Mr Beale) has said that he does not anticipate that any great degree of difference will arise between the board and the Government. I remind him that, twenty years ago, a marked difference of opinion arose between the then Commonwealth Bank Board and the government of the day. Similar differences may arise in the near future. Under the provisions of this proposed new section, the Government, by a policy of procrastination, may defer consideration by the Parliament of any differences of opinion between the board and the Government, and thus cause great damage to be done to the economy of the nation. The Government pronoses to adopt a new form of control On of the decisions of the board. At best, it will be no better than the existing control, and, at worse, it may easily produce most disastrous results. A cursory glance",30,Commonwealth Bank

For the sake of argument, let us imagine that the government of the day disagrees with the board. It might declare, "" We consider that there should be a bolder policy of development "", or "" We consider that this policy is not calculated to maintain employment"". Then it would announce the policy that it favoured. If the bank board disagreed with it, the procedure laid down in the proposed section would then come into effect. The Treasurer would be obliged to lay before both Mouses of the Parliament within fifteen sitting days a statement of the reasons that had caused it to take such action. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr The provision means nothing. It merely Chifley) has suggested that the tabling of papers in the Parliament would be merely a sort of kindly formality and that nothing more would be done. Government would have acted in defiance of the advice given to it by the Commonwealth Bank Board and wouln have dictated the policy to be adopted by the bank. Does any practical parliamentarian really believe that there is any substance in the argument that the tabling of the documents would not be followed in this Parliament by very serious consequences to the Government if the Government's policy was not acceptable to the community and, therefore, to the Parliament?

The Minister for Transport ( Mr Beale), who was in charge of the committee earlier this afternoon, protested vociferously about the statements that had been made by members of the Opposition, but the fact remains, in spite of his declarations, that, if the proposal to establish a Commonwealth Bank Board is to be accepted, the remainder of proposed section 9A is mere humbug. That is crystal clear. represents an attempt by the Government to convince the people that it intends to retain some of the provisions of the vital legislation of 1945, which it was not What are the facts?

The Sydney Morning Herald recently published a hypocritical leading article in which it shed crocodile tears as it criticized the Government.

Of course, it will compromise with the proposed board when it is established. There will be one compromise after another.

I remind him of the famous warning that all the people can be fooled some of the time and some of the people can be fooled all the time but all the people cannot be fooled all the time. He will learn the truth of that adage before long. Let us examine this fallacy of a dictatorship by the Treasurer under the existing legislation. In the first place, the Treasurer, whoever he may he for the time being, must be elected by the democratic system of this country to represent a constituency in this Parliament. Then he must be elected as a member of a political party that is favoured by a majority of the people of Australia. Next he must go to the party room and be appointed by members of the caucus to the Cabinet. Having become Treasurer, he must refer all his proposals to the Cabinet before he can do anything about dictating to the Commonwealth Bank HJnlesss his. proposals are. acceptable to the Cabinet, he cannot enforce them upon the hank authorities. Furthermore, evens if his plans are accepted by the Cabinet,, he must then submit them to the caucus and obtain its approval before he can refer them to the Parliament. Finally, the Government of which he if a member must command a majority in both Houses of the Parliament. Thank God this Government has only a minority in the Senate at present !!

I know the honourable member well and we are good friends. However, he suggested that, if a government took action gets away in relation, to monetary policy that, in the minds of honourable members,, was inimical to the. interests of Australia, the Parliament would force it. to retract. He suggested that he would be prepared to vote against the Government. I say. from my knowledge of him, that he is too good a party man to do that. I do not believe that he would do it.. The claim that the Parliament will control monetary policy is sheer nonsense: The honourable member formerly criticized the Labour Government because it would not accept any amendments to legislation that it brought down in this Parliament. He accused it of having established a dictatorship. W« shall see, as time passes, how many supporters of this Government will cross the floor of this chamber to vote against the Government on any issue, whether it involves monetary policy or anything else. The Parliament, as a Parliament, has no control over monetary policy. The people have control over monetary policy through their representatives in this Parliament only once in every three years.

That is clearly laid down in the section I have quoted. The proposed section before the committee by, in part, substituting the board for the Governor of the bank, docs precisely what was done by section 9 of tbe 1945 act. The Government has always contended that it must have the prime responsibility for the determination of national financial policy. I remember I tion of that policy without reference not complaining about that. either to the Parliament or to the people. not necessarily the Executive. It is principle is clearly enough enunciated.

The point that I make is that the Government is preserving its right of determining in the last analysis what the financial policy shall be. The bill removes power from the hands of one man, who could act hehind the back of his Cabinet, and puts it right where it should be-in the hands of the Executive Council. The bill provides that when a disagreement on policy occurs between the bank and the Government, the matter must be placed before",36,Commonwealth Bank

The Parliament will then be able to consider the matter, having before it a copy of the order determining the policy, a statement by the Government in relation to the matter in respect of which the difference of opinion arose, and a copy, of the statement furnished to the Treasurer by the board under sub-section (3.). Even if that meant merely that there would be a discussion in the Parliament, that in itself would constitute a brake upon dictatorship in the financial policy of the country. As was pointed out by an interjector, there is no provision for disallowance in this proposed section able gentleman agree with that? honourable member who preceded me pointed out that there is provision in the Standing Orders whereby if the Parliament disagrees with financial policy, the Government can be challenged at any time. The power of challenge is in the hands of any section of the Parliament, the Opposition as well as the Government. If a dispute occurs between the bank and the Government upon a matter of vital policy, the power of disallowance will not be needed because the power of censure of the Government is in the hands of honourable members. A motion can be made expressing disagreement with the Government's policy. The important consideration is that policy-making is removed from the hands of one man, the Treasurer, who is at present able to determine policy without Cabinet discussion. The result of the 1945 legislation is illustrated by the action of the previous Treasurer when he altered the exchange rate. This bill will put a brake on the occurrence of that sort of thing. It puts the power where it should be, that is, in the hand of the executive government. The bill finally provides that if there is a disagreement the Government's opinion shall not prevail without criticism. The Government's policy will eome before the Parliament so that the whole matter may be debated before the people. There can be no real objection to that. I could understand honourable members opposite, whilst disagreeing with their action, taking some time on the preceding proposed section, but, for the life of me, I cannot understand, having in mind section 9 of the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945, why they are stonewalling this proposed section. They are seeking so to take up time in the discussion of unnecessary matters as to prevent, the Government from getting on with the business of governing. grateful to the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) for his explanation of this particular proposed section, because whilst he considers that it does not need to be debated, I believe that discussion of it is essential. In his explanation of the bill the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden), for the purpose of window-dressing, informed the House that the Government was removing power over the Commonwealth Bank from the hands of a dictator and putting it into the hands of the elected representatives of the people. 1 think the explanation made by the Minister for External Affairs this afternoon differs from that given by the Treasurer. I am sorry that the Treasurer, who regards this as a most important measure, is not present to explain its various provisions. I believe that he would be serving the interests of his own constituents if he were here. movements of the Treasurer are no concern of the committee. The honourable member must deal with the proposed section. man, but the Treasurer's movements are of importance to me because I should like him to explain certain portions of the bill. As the Minister responsible for it, he should be the most capable person to make those explanations. Instead of electioneering in Queensland honourable member will keep to the proposed section, otherwise I shall have to ask him to resume his seat. closely to it. The point I wish to mako is that whilst in the ultimate result there is no difference between it and the legislation enacted in 1945, many more steps must be taken before that ultimate result",37,Chairman Order The Obvious To Any One Who Reads It That That

Then the Treasurer shall report to the Cabinet, -and the Cabinet shall agree with the Treasurer. -Council shall make some rule, and eventually the important decision shall be -arrived at that the Treasurer has disagreed with the bank board and that the wil] of the Treasurer shall prevail. Before his will prevails there must be a lot of window-dressing to show that grave deliberations have taken place. The effect of this proposed section will not be any different from that of section -9 of the 1945 act, which clearly states that in the event of a disagreement between the Treasurer and the Governor of the bank the Treasurer's will shall prevail. As the Minister for External Affairs has explained, the Treasurer, upon disagreement, must, under the new provisions, have the support of the Cabinet. Under the existing legislation the Treasurer must also have the support of the Government, and the Cabinet must have the support of the ministerial party. In effect, the Treasurer must have the support of the majority of the members of this chamber. Unless he has that support his disagreement with the bank will get him nowhere. He is not a dictator, and never has been one. It may be shown that the new section 9A will give to the Treasurer the same dictatorial powers that are alleged to have been exercised by him under the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945. But the Government has been obliged to "" cover u p "" after all the false propaganda that was disseminated during the general election campaign about financial dictatorship, and proposed section 9A has been incorporated in the bill merely to hoodwink honourable members and the electors. The position under this legislation will be similar to that under the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945. Under it, the Parliament will have no more power over financial policy than it has under the existing act We do not need window dressing of this kind. We can get on very well without this provision. The act should not be cluttered with unnecessary sections and sub-sections that may It is proposed eventually give leading King's Counsel cause to argue before the High Court of Australia the meaning of the words they contain. A clause and a proposed section should be couched in Then the Executive clear, concise language that can be understood by the people. They should not contain unnecessary words that are, to my mind, purely window dressing in order to convey to the public the idea that the Government is endeavouring to do something entirely different from what it proposes to do. The Government is attempting to throw dust into the eyes of the people, and mislead them into believing that a different form of control is being instituted as between the Treasurer and the Commonwealth Bank. Yet, in the final analysis, the proposed system of control is exactly the same as the existing system. Under proposed section 9A there will be a grave danger of the people being "" sold out"". I believe that the Commonwealth Bank Board is being established to look after the interests of the private financial institutions of this country at the expense of the general public. Proposed section 9A is an additional safeguard for those private institutions because of the possibility that their representatives will be in a minority on the bank board. Should that prove to be the case, the Treasurer will have an opportunity to intervene on their side, and to ensure that their will shall prevail. That risk is very real. We know that during the depression, the Commonwealth Bank Board usurped the power that rightly belonged to the people of Australia, and I for one am not prepared to agree to any proposal that will take from the elected representatives of the people the entire control of the financial policy of the country. The first essential in good government is that the government of the day shall have complete control of the financial resources of Australia, so that they may be used in the best interests of the people generally, and so that the financial interests cannot grow richer. orable member's remarks are not relevant to proposed section 9A, which deals with",38,Chairman Order The Obvious To Any One Who Reads It That That

It will not improve the existing position, and, indeed, I regard it as definitely a retrograde step, and voice my opposition to it. orable member has exhausted his time. -Members of the Opposition have indulged in a good deal of double talk about proposed section 9A, and I propose to bring the discussion back to earth. We are simply considering the changes that the proposed section will make to the existing set-up under section 9 of the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945. Opposition members have endeavoured to show that the proposed section is bad because it is exactly what the private bauks want, and they have also tried to show that it is bad because it is exactly what the private banks do not want. The two arguments obviously cancel one another. The Opposition is not seriously objecting to the proposed section, but is acting for some motive that has not yet been disclosed. If members of the Opposition had been acting honestly, they would have brought forward more substantial arguments to support their contentions. Let us examine proposed section 9A, and the way in which it will amend section 9 of the Commonwealth Bank Act1945. It provides that when a difference of opinion arises between the Commonwealth Bank and the Government, the view that will prevail will be that of the Governor General in Council, and not simply that of the Treasurer. In spite of the arguments that have been adduced by Opposition members, that is a very real difference. We all remember that the original decision by the Chifley Government to nationalize the banking system was made, not by Cabinet or caucus, and certainly not by the Parliament, but by the Trea""surer and two or three senior Ministers, who issued the relevant press statement. I ask the honorwithout even consulting Cabinet. Because that kind of thing happened in the past, we suspect that a real difference of opinion existed between the Treasurer and the Governor General in Council about the policy. We have known of a dictatorial Treasurer who did not consult even his own Cabinet upon matters of the gravest public importance. The decision to devalue the Australian £1 in relation to sterling was taken by a snap conference in a taxi cab. Again, the dictatorial Treasurer had acted. That distinction between proposed section 9A and section 9 of the Commonwealth Bank Act is very relevant, and I have no doubt honourable members of the Opposition are indignant about it. However, even that point, substantial though it is, is hardly the reason for the vehemence with which the Opposition members are opposing the bill. They must have some motive. member think it is? their motive? It must be related to one of two things, either to the period during which the present Government will be in power, or to the distant time-perhap s the very far-distant time-whe n the Labour party will be in power. Let us examine those two propositions. It is obvious that while the present Government is in office, it will have complete power, under section 9 of the existing act, to decide banking policy. Therefore, the Opposition cannot be concerned about the possibility of the present Treasurer and the present Government obtaining more power, because they already have power which, so far from being added to, will be derogated from by proposed section 9A. But as well as the power that the Governor of the bank has at the present time under the existing act, subject to the dictates of the Treasurer, he also has secret powers.

172,Mr Tom Burke (Perth) [5.15],"honourable member's party might do in the future what it had attempted to do in the past.; member referred to a "" dictatorial Treasurer"" and a "" dictatorial Governor"", but an honourable member who has the most practical knowledge of this matter has stated recently that there is no dictatorial power in the Treasurer or the Governor of the bank because, as the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) has said, whether there is a power to disallow or not, the forms of this House provide that any decision of the Treasurer in relation to the financial policy of the Government, can be questioned at any time by any member of this Parliament, and that no dictation can be exerted upon and no secrets can be withheld from this Parliament. The Minister for External Affairs also said that there is no need to have in the legislation placed before the Parliament the power to disallow regulations, because the forms of tlie House give full opportunity for discussion and full power, in certain circumstances, for disallowance. However, what I rose to discuss, in addition to other matters, is the reason for our opposition to the proposed section in particular. Our aim is to find the motive behind the Government's introduction of this bill and the inclusion in it of the proposed new sections to which we have directed attention. ""We had not been informed of the Government's motives until the honourable member for Mackellar had spoken. No one had said clearly why the board was to be established, but the honourable member for Mackellar, less subtle and less practised in debate than other honourable members, has clearly indicated that this Government fears the financial knowledge and experience possessed by Dr. Ooombs. It fears that he will follow a banking policy in line with the enlightened policy that has been developed and is being enjoyed in modern times. For that reason it intends to have his efforts nullified by the proposed board. If, despite the provision in the bill that the Governor, shall act in accordance with any directions of the board Dr. Coombs, by virtue of hissuperior knowledge of finance and his knowledge of world events is able to convince the board of the possible ill effects of a certain policy, the Government will still have the use of theprovision, which its members hotly contested on former occasions, and which it has retained in this bill, that will allow it to override Dr. Coombs. The honourable member for Mackellar is a spokesman for the Government, and is one of itsleading experts in this particular matter and he has indicated that he regards Dr. Coombs as a radical and a socialist. The Government does not dare to remove Dr.. Coombs from his position, and so it istrying to smother his efforts through this proposed board. In addition it is also reserving to itself a power which, as I said earlier, its members fiercely opposed on a former occasion, so that Dr.. Coombs may be defeated by the Treasurer and, as honourable members opposite say, by the Parliament. So we are to witness in this Parliament the very great farce that will result from the provision that in theevent of a disagreement between the board and the Treasurer the point of disagreement shall be discussed, by Cabinet presumably, shall then be referred to the Executive Council that an order shall be made and that subsequent orders on related matters may be tabled in this Parliament. What new power does that give to the Parliament? It gives no power at all that is not provided in existing legislation. The Minister for External Affairs made that abundantly clear. There is nothing new in it and not one additional safeguard. It contains no new democratic process. It is camouflage and, as the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryson) has called it, window-dressing designed merely to deceive the people of this county. It is designed also to preserve control over the Governor of the bank who, with the knowledge and experience that he has gained, might be able to convince the proposed board that his policy and not its policy on some particular matter was correct. In addition to the fact that the Government is preserving something to which its members previously objected very strenuously, we shall have a second, and. in my opinion, a very dangerous result arising from the",41,Chairman Orde R 1 The Speakers In Relation To The Proposed Sec
173,Mr Wentwobth,I said that the,42,Chairman Orde R 1 The Speakers In Relation To The Proposed Sec
174,Mr Tom Burke,"The honorableproposed new sub-section (2.). The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) -has said that that proposed new subsection is not only unnecessary, but also mischievous. In my opinion, it is highly mischievous. Let us consider what the possible points of disagreement between the Treasurer and the board might be. I should imagine that there would be about four possible points of disagreement. The first is in relation to the policy of overdraft accommodation. That would not be -objected to strenuously and not much disagreement can be expected on it. The -second and very controversial point is on the alteration of our present -exchange rate. All that will need to happen for that exchange rate to be -altered is for the Commonwealth Bank to say that, as from a certain -date, it will ""buy and sell foreign -exchange at .a rate that it has determined. That decision would come into operation immediately, and what could the Government do about it? It could have a discussion and decide to override the decision, but the act would have been accomplished and the exchange rate would have been varied. The deed would be an accomplished fact. I believe that the -Government intends to establish the board because it does not wish to make a decision for which it will be responsible, hut wishes to pass the responsibility on to this expert bank board. It is an alibi and an avenue of escape for the Government in relation to a matter that is -pxercising the public mind very actively .at the moment. When the decision to .alter the exchange rate has been taken and -applied there will be no possible hope of its being reversed. The present Governor of the bank, Dr. Coombs, would not dare to take such a step without consulting the Treasurer, but the responsibility would be -spread over a wider field if the board took that step, and, therefore, the board might -do so. The act would be accomplished .and then we should go through this farce -of the Treasurer tabling papers in the Parliament and saying why he disagrees with the decision. Why might the bank board decide to alter the exchange rate? Simply because the Com1 monwealth Bank is going to lose on -every £1 of accumulated overseas funds when .appreciation .of the £1 occurs. These funds are piling up daily because of the ""hot"" money thai is coming to this country due to the inaction and indecision of this Government. The bank board will say, "" If we do not alter the exchange rate then in another three or six months' time our losses on our overseas funds will be substantially heavier "". Therefore, the bank board will alter the rate so as to cut the losses and the Treasurer can wring his hands futilely if he wishes, and table a statement in this Parliament, but the act will have been accomplished. Another point of disagreement could be in regard to rates of interest. The board will return to the old theories about combating inflation and decide that, in order to prevent "" run away"" inflation, it will raise the rate of interest payable on bank loans. Its decision will apply immediately to deposits and overdrafts, and then agaiD we shall have perpetuated the farce of thf Treasurer tabling a statement in this Parliament informing it of what has been done. What attitude will the Governmeni take regarding the need to expand credit in a time of falling prices and developing depression ? It will go to the bank board and say, "" We want you to expand credit"". It will not say, "" Expand the note issue "". Snch an action as expanding the nottissue is meaningless to-day. The note issue is the small change of economic activity. The bank board will object and say that expansion of credit is inflation, as the previous bank board did on former occasions. So the Government will direct the bank board, through the Treasurer and the Executive Council honourable gentleman's time has expired. proposed new section deals with the policy of the bank board and the degree of parliamentary control that will b<exercised over its decisions. So far we have heard a number of reason.' for the Opposition's objections to the proposed section.

I may crave a moment of your time, Mr Speaker, I direct your attention to the fact that there has been a great deal of dissatisfaction about the issue of tickets for admission to this House. When I made applicacation this morning for one ticket I was told that all the tickets that were available had been issued three or four days ago. I have been informed by other honourable members that they had a similar experience.

Because of that I have been obliged to refuse requests from certain residents of Canberra. Except in one or two cases, in one of which overseas visitors were being looked after, they have been told that they could not be admitted. I assure honourable members that my officers and I have given full and careful consideration to this matter.

This pToposed law is, in a most special and important sense, a law relating to 'the safety and defence of Australia. It is designed to deal with, and, in -certain cases, to give the Government power to deal with, the King's enemies in this country. If it touches certain Communists In their industrial office, as it certainly does, that is merely an inevitable consequence of a self-defending attack upon treason and fifth-columnism wherever they may be found. Let me say at the outset that it will be -without avail for -any honourable member to point-out, as -can ,be done quite readily, that for some years I and -other per-so-ns resisted the idea of a (Communist ban -on the ground that, i a time of peace, doubts ought to be resolved in favour wf fr-ee speech.

T i e Soviet Union-and I say this with profound regret-ha s made perfect the technique of the "" cold-war ""_ It has accompanied it by the organization of peace demonstrations-peac e demonstrations, sav-e the markl-'designed , not to promote true pea-ee, fart to prevent or impair -defence preparations in the democracies. We in this House and in this eom-rrfery, and -people all -over the British world, have witnessed the most threatenjiag ieipents in eastern Europe, in ""Germany, in East Asia and in South-East Asia. If 5p* have learned ""nothing from all these things then, in the farnoms phrase, -there is »o health in JJS. The real and active Communists in Australia present us with our immediate problem-no t the woolly-headed dupes, not the people who are pushed to the front in order to present a respectiible appearance, but the real and active Communists. We have a clear choice, and we must make it clearly. We can attack ttoese Communists frontaHy, or we can adapt inaction and justify it by accepting one or all of the arguments that arc used currently to jrastify inaction. Let me .examine one or two of them before I go any further. I have selected merely tibvose (that have the greatest currency. The first alignment that is put is, "" Well, the Communists are wrong, .but we must not impair liberty, because liberty as democracy's cause "". Why, then, did we fight the Germans^ Because they sought to overthrow liberty! Can we recognize and -deal with the enemies of liberty only when they actually take up arms-? Are we to treat deliberate frustration of national recovery, of economic stability and of proper defence preparations as a mere ""exercise of normal civil rights? In any 'event, what is liberty ? Liberty is sot .an abstraction. It must be related in this -world and in these days =to the recognition xrf the State and, in a democracy, to the recognifion of self-governing institutions. Unless that is true there can be no such -thing as treason, mo such thing as subversive activity. After all, what liberty should there be for thp emeraies -of ilibenty under the law? It is a curious and dangerous error of thought to be prepared to deal with individual sedition but to ,give immunity to sedition in the mass. The second argument that is advanced is, "" You .cannot suppress ideas "". That ie -quite .true. Ideas may be the most powerful things in the world. .Buti f ideas give rise to overt action, and that action is againat ithe safety and defence of the realm, we are not only ientitled hut also bound to suppress it. Nothing nauseates me mare than to discover the skill with which rthese Communists -can put into their vanguard some deluded Minister of the Christian religion. I should like to say to all of .them that I -have no hostility to minority -movements. Christianity itself is the .greatest minority movement of .history, bait they should remember the words -of its Founder. Christianity from the beginning was never the enemy of law or order. "" Bender unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's."" The .third argument is, "" Yon must not touch a Communist if he is a .union odficial"". That is an .arrogant claim, because it seeks to put the trade unions above the law, and most unionists, as good democrats, will reject it. A brief analysis will demonstrate its want of substance. If communism is just a peaceful political philosophy, then the Communists should go free whether they be unionists or non-unionists. If communism in action is just militant unionism, opposed to arbitration but determined to alter tbe law by lawful means, no punitive action against communism can be justified. But if communism is an international conspiracy against the democracies, organized as a prelude to war and operating as a fifth -column in advance of hostilities and if it is a subversive movement challenging law, self-government and domestic peace, then the alleged immunity of the official of a union or any other body is utter fantasy. For, once you establish that the Communist is our enemy, the fact that he occupies a key industrial position with power to hold up work, so far from being a ground of immunity, is the best reason in the world for removing him from that position. At the last general election, 87,958 persons, a small fraction of the total number of electors, voted for -Communist candidates. ance of the Australian Communist is, therefore, not numerical but positional. It is the position he occupies that counts. In order to establish that fact, I propose to refer, at the risk of being tedious, to a list of Communists in high union office. In the first place, eleven prominent trade union officials are members of the central committee of the Australian Communist party. Now let us have their names. Let us look at the jobs that they hold in order to see how this comparatively small handful .of men have got into positions from which they can do -damage to this great and beloved country -of ours. Their names areE. Federated Iron workers' Association. J . McPhillips, assistant general secretary, Federated Iron workers' Assotion. E . V. Elliott, general secretary, Seamen's Union of Australia. J . Healy, general secretary, Waterside Workers' Federation. T. Wright, federal president and New South Wales secretary, Sheet Metal Workers' Union. J. R.

Williams, federal president, Miners' Federation. E. Ross, amenities officer, Miners' Federation, and associate editor of Common Cause. D. Thomson, secretary, Victorian Building Trades Federation, and Federal secretary, Operative Painters' Union. A. MacDonald, Queensland secretary, Federated Iron workers' Association. They are the names of eleven men, all of whom are members of the central committee of the Australian Communist party.. I add to that list, not for the purpose of completing it, but by way of illustration, because these names are not by any means all, the names of other Communists who hold important union office in key industries. I hope that honourable members will be patient with The importme because there are more names than ten or twenty on this list, but every one of the people detailed in the list is in a key industry. The names areW. G. Hale, general secretary, and New South Wales State secretary, and Sydney sub-branch secretary, Blacksmiths' Society of Australasia. A. R.

Troy, secretary, Coastal, Docks, Rivers and Harbour Workers Union, Western Australia. It takes some time to read even such a short list as that, but I hope that it will be well observed in this country that these Communists are not to be ignored as if they were a mere handful. They occupy key positions in key organizations in the industries upon which this country would have to depend if tomorrow it were fighting for its life. The choice before us is a grim but a simple one. We can do nothing, and let a traitorous minority destroy us, as they most assuredly intend to do; we can leave the Communist free to do his work so long as he is a union official, but deal with him in any other capacity; or-and this is the answer to the choice-w e can fight him wherever we find him, leaving him no immunity and no sanctuary at all. It is an insult to the Australian unionist to treat him as a man incapable of reason, or as a citizen indifferent to the .march of communism in the world or to the safety of his own land. So far I have dealt with three arguments that have been raised. I turn now to the fourth. That argument is that -by banning the Communists we shall merely drive them underground. In the light of what we now know of the international and domestic activities of communism, that argument is not to be taken seriously. Some of the deeds of the Communists see the daylight, but their planning is done by stealth and in secrecy. In short, they are underground already. One thing that we can be certain about, and that I am grateful for, is that once the taint of illegality is placed on this organization of conspiracy its capacity to delude well-meaning people into providing it with a ""respectable "" front"" will be sensibly diminished. I turn now to the recitals set out in the bill because, as honourable members will see, this bill is introduced by a series of recitals which, first of all, set out the power that the Commonwealth is using to deal with the Communists; and, secondly, set out what I shall roughly describe as the case against the Australian Communist. If honourable members look at the first three recitals they will find that reference is made in them to the power of the Commonwealth of Australia to make laws with respect to the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth and of the States. The Executive power to maintain the Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth, and the general incidental powers of the Constitution are also mentioned. I refer to those, not because I want to take up time dealing with them, but because I want to emphasize to all honourable members that in dealing with this menace we stand on two great principles. The first is the defence of this country, and the second is our right and duty to maintain the Constitution and the laws against any wrecking attack whatever. I emphasize throughout that this is no ordinary act Mr Menoies. of Parliament. It is not a bill about conciliation and arbitration; it is a bill for an act about the defence of this country. Having recited our power, the bill goes on to allege five sets of facts which the House is asked to accept as the justification for lihe Government's action. There are five counts in this indictment, and I accept at once the responsibility of demonstrating their truth. Indeed, as I proceed, the House will discover that I propose, during the course of this speech, to call as witnesses to sustain these five counts, the most authoritative persons-Lenin, Stalin, Australian Communist leaders, and the Australian Labour party in the person of my friend the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. They shall all be giving evidence in respect of this indictment before my remarks end. Each of the recitals, I believe, can be readily demonstrated to be true. In total, they establish a state of affairs both menacing and alarming, and one which no democratic parliament can ignore. It is a state of affairs that cries aloud for strong, united and positive action. I shall take the material recitals in their order. I consider first, the fourth recital in the order in which they appear in the preamble. That saysAnd whereas the Australian Communist party, in accordance with the basic theory of communism, as expounded by Marx and Lenin, engages in activities or operations designed to assist or accelerate the coming of a revolutionary situation, in which the Australian Communist party, acting as a revolutionary minority, would be able to seize power and establish a dictatorship of the proletariat. I apologize for the long words included in that recital, but they are not ours. The world "" proletariat"" is one of those dreadful words that the Communists have foisted on to the world. I have here a copy of the constitution of the Australian Communist party, and a fascinating document it is. If one were to read it, with the omission of one passage that I shall refer to, one would almost think that the Communist party was the right wing of the Labour party. If ever there has been a fraudulent document, it is this constitution of the Australian Communist party. It is, on the face of it, fraudulent, because it piously claims that the party is afirmsupporter of the United Nations, that it believes in world peace, and that it does not aim at establishing a totalitarian State. It even professes to adopt the democratic method, because it talks about the necessity for winning a majority of the Australian people. Such a fraudulent affair I have rarely looked at. the innocent flower, but be the serpent under it "" . If we look for the serpent under it, we shall find it at once. The whole thing is so inconsistent with the beliefs of Russian communism that I felt rather thankful to find that the Australian Communist, forgetting for the moment this air of respectability, put himself, to use his own words, "" into line with the great teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin"". Now let us have a look at what those great teachings are, on the line of which the Australian Communist party goes out to its task. A little more realism emerges from the Australian edition of The Foundations of Leninism, by Joseph Stalin, which was published here in 1942, and reprinted in 1943 and again in 1944. It has a foreword by the celebrated Australian Communist, L . L . Sharkey. He is one of the leading Australian Communists, and in that foreword he forgets about the respectable words that he is going to write into the constitution of the party some day, and writes as follows:This little book, The Foundations of Leninism, is as invaluable for us to-day as when it was first penned, especially for the understanding of the developing world-wide Those are strong words. We are dealing people's movement: its organizations before here not with the mild exercises of the and after its victory and, in particular, the debating society, but with a programme role and form of organization of the advanceguard of the working class. So here it is, ushered in by the Australian Communist Sharkey. We have in this book a look at Stalin's interpretation of Lenin, and Lenin's interpretation of Marx and Engels. This is not ancient history. Here is an interpretation by the modern ruler, the man who at this moment rules Russian communism, of the former distinguished ruler of the same movement, and of the classical founders of it. In that book Stalin cancels the later false pretences of the Australian Communist party with one sweeping gesture. This is what he saysConcerning the prerequisites for the seizure of power by the proletariat. The opportunists assert that the proletariat cannot and ought not to seize power if it does not itself constitute a majority in the country. No proofs are adduced, for this absurd thesis cannot be justified either theoretically or practically. That is a very interesting revelation of the Communist mind. In the same imIt is a case of ""look like portant book, the greatest modern Communist emphasizes our words in the recital, "" assist or accelerate the coming of a revolutionary situation"". I invite the attention of all good Australians who love their own country and who value their own traditions and freedom to pay heed to them. They are as follows:But the overthrow of the power of the bourgeoisie and establishment of the power of the proletariat in one country still does not mean that the complete victory of socialism has been ensured. After consolidating its power and taking the peasantry in tow, the proletariat of the victorious country can and must build up a socialist society. But does this mean that it will thereby achieve the complete and final victory of socialism, i.e., does it mean that with the forces of only one country it can finally consolidate socialism and fully guarantee that country against intervention? . . . No, it does not. For this the victory of the revolution in at least several countries is needed. Therefore, the development and support of revolution in other countries is an essential task of the victorious revolution. Therefore, the revolution in the victorious country must regard itself as a means of hastening the victory of the proletariat in other countries. Lenin expressed this thought in a nutshell, when he said that the task of the victorious revolution is to do the utmost possible in one country for the development, support and stirring up of the revolution in all countries deliberately considered and explained to us by the man who, perhaps, at this moment, exercises more power over more people than does any other human being in the world. The next recital in the bill to which I shall refer, is in the following words:And whereas the Australian Communist Party also engages in activities or operations designed to bring about the overthrow or dislocation of the established system of government of Australia and the attainment of economic, industrial or political ends by force, violence, intimidation or fraudulent practices: No person who is familiar with modern history will require much proof of those allegations, but if needed, it is available in abundance. I go back to Stalin himself. In his book from which I have already quoted, he makes, at a certain stage, some rather contemptuous remarks about orthodox Labour governments like that of the late Ramsay MacDonald in Great Britain, and he statesThe dictatorship of the proletariat does not of thousands of other Australians dwelling arise on the basis of the bourgeois order; it peacefully in their homes and among arises while this order is being torn down, their children. I quote another statement after the overthrow of the bourgeoisie, in the process of the expropriation of the landlords by Stalin. I assure the House that I and capitalists, during the process of socializaam not trying to overload this matter, tion of the principal instruments and means but these are pregnant wordsof production, in the process of violent proletarian revolution. The dictatorship of the proletariat is a revolutionary power based on violence against the bourgeoisie. I have not been able to put my hand on the precise text during the last few days, but I well remember a statement which was made by Lenin himself when somebody said, in effect, ""Yes, but the word ' revolution', you know, has an ugly sound. Does it not simply mean 'reform'-to get something by pressure, by arrangement, by bargain ?"" Lenin's reply was in line with what all the great Communists have said for years. It was as follows:-""Reform! The reformists! We reserve the lowest place in hell for the reformists. 'Revolution' means what it says. It means guns, rifles, bayonets"". Let no one be woolly-minded about this matter. When Stalin talks about revolutionary power based on violence, he means exactly what he says. familiar, of course, with the jargon of the Marxist writers. They talk about the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Indeed, they seem to be incapable of: saying things in what we would regard as a simple way; although their meaning, I am afraid, is all too clear and their actions are even clearer. A "" bourgeois "", wretched creature, began life in France as what we call a ""burgess""-that ia to say, the citizen of a city or a burgh as distinct from a country dweller. But as Marx and Engels and their successors use the term, it describes what would be called in other countries the middle classes, the capitalists, great or small, the people with money saved,, the shopkeepers, the fanners and all those who are not wage-earners and not those who, in the words of Engelshaving no means of productiono f their own, are reduced to selling, their labour power in order to live. Mr Menties. The latter are the proletariat. I pause to make that short explanation because, clearly, we in this Parliament, whether we like it or not, belong to the bourgeoisie, and so, thank Heaven, do many hundreds To put it briefly: The dictatorship of the proletariat is the domination of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, untrammelled by law and based on violence and enjoying the sympathy and. support of the toiling and exploited masses. The same man is even franker a little later in his celebrated lectures when he talks about the destruction of the bourgeois State machine, of the bourgeois army, of the bourgeois civil administration and of the bourgeois police. He then makes the following statement:In other words, the law of violent proletarian revolution, the law of destruction of the machinery of the bourgeois state as a condition precedent for such revolution, is an inevitable law of the revolutionary movement in the imperialist countries of the world. We may as well face up to the fact that to-day we are, in the view of the Communists, one of the imperialist countries of the world. There is a reference in the Honourable members are preamble to fraud. Stalin, in his lectures, has given us a sidelight on fraud. He has statedThe revolutionary will accept a Teform in order to use it as a means wherewith to link legal work with illegal work, in order to use it as a screen behind which his illegal activities for the revolutionary preparation of the masses for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie may be intensified. Does not that ring a bell in the minds of Australians? Have they not seen, time after time, the Australian Communist with all this wicked scheming in his mind, getting in alongside people, and claiming the merit for some reform, and the credit for some wage increase or for some advance, because, as his leader has said, it is necessary to link the legal with the illegal so that, the fraud may be all the more successful. Such quotations as I have given may be multiplied. I shall not multiply them, because they are more than suflicient to establish not only that modern, communism is prepared to adopt force, violence and fraud, but also that these diabolical doctrines enjoy the goodwill, and, indeed, are written on the banner, of the Australian Communists. Sharkey, to whom I have referred, published in 1942 and 1943 a pamphlet on the trade unions. Let us not forget what happened in those years-the battles of the Coral Sea and the Kokoda Trail. Sharkey called the pamphlet The Trade Unions. In his preface he acknowledges, I am happy to say because it may be useful to us hereafter, the services of a number of ""comrades"", particularly Comrades Miles, Dixon, Thornton and Wright. Their names will not be overlooked. In that pamphlet Sharkey attacked quite candidly the problem of the relationship between the Communist and the trade union. Like all Communist writers, as I have said, he uses the most abominably prolix langauge, but the meaning is clear enough. He saysMarxism-Leninism thus places a fundamental task for us in regard to the trade unions, the defeat of reformism . . . for which almost every honourable member opposite has stood, I venture to say, all his lifeand their transformation into revolutionary indeed that it is a pity that some of the bodies fighting for the Proletarian Dictatorship. Here is the united front coming out of the for. He sees the shop committee as a mists, this notion that has been peddled weapon for dastardly Communist designs. for the last few weeks, chalked on walls This is what he saysin such words as the following:Make a united front against tbe Government. He then goes on to expose the hand of the Communists-the hand that has been exposed in this campaign with which we are all familiar. If any of the hundreds of thousands of decent, honest, patriotic Australian trade unionists have been tempted to accept a call for a united front under the good old name of ""solidarity"" they should pay attention to what Sharkey says in this pamphlet, because here are his wordsThe main task of the Communist parties of his own ends. the west at the present time is to develop the campaign for unity in the trade union movement and to bring it to its consummation; now to the best proof of all of the gravity to see to it that all Communists, without exception, join trade unions, there to work of this problem and of the temperate systematically and patiently to strengthen the nature of the language of the recitals. solidarity of the working class in its fight That proof comes from the Labour party against capital, and thus attain the condition that will enable the Communist parties to rely upon the trade unions. Sharkey, having quoted that statement, saysThese words were spoken by Stalin sixteen years ago, but they might have been said yesterday, for they still hold force for us. The same Australian Communist leader, as an earnest disciple of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin has nothing but contempt for the "" reformers "". The words ""reformer"" and ""reformist"" run through all the writings of all the Communists. They are stingingly used by them to describe those who seek what we in Australia call "" constitutional action "", and who are opposed to bloody and violent revolution. This is what he says about themReformism no longer has 100 per cent, domination of the Australian union movement. Tlie Communists are now a growing and powerful force, challenging the whole position of reformism and transforming the trade unions into organs of revolutionary strusrgle for socialism. In the process, the trade union movement will be freed from the paralysing grip of arbitration. Finally he refers to that apparently innocent body, the shop committee. Again he is uncommonly frank, so frank fools who are deluded by these people should not know what they really stand The shop committees play a most important role in the preparation and mobilization of the workers for strike action. They play an important Tole in leading the stnke and combating betrayal and reformist misleadership. In a revolutionary situation, the Shop Committees would be one of the chief instruments for drawing the whole of the working class into the fight, into the street, and the general revolutionary struggle. Let us understand that all those things, so good in their fashion, so capable of being well used, are seized upon by the Communist, if he is in the right position to use them, as a means of engineering Having called those witnesses I turn itself. Honourable members will recall that last year, during the great coal strike, the then Government inserted in the press a series of advertisements that carried the line "" Authorized by the Prime Minister of Australia "". I shall quote a few passages from those advertisements, not only because they emanated from the Labour party but because the present Government agrees with them and considers them admirably expressed. Here are the words used in one advertisementThis strike was planned months ago by the Communist section of the Miners' leaders. of They did not want the claims to be dealt with social by Arbitration. Miners! Do not be misled by Communist Communists who want to wreck the Arbitrachaos, socialpolicy tion system. Here is another advertisementThis is a strike against Arbitration engisuppresion by secret police of these civil neered by the Communist party as part of a conliberties which the Australian Labour party spiracy to prevent Miners from obtaining any is pledged to defend. gains from the lawfully-constituted tribunal. The imprisonment of J . H . King (secretary Those are not the words of some reacof the Western Minors' Federation) and another tionary tory body. Those are the words union official is the direct result of this of the Australian Labour party. They conspiracy and nothing else. Another advertisement readBritain and the Dominions face crucial problems in the very near future . . . How true that was and is. The advertisement continuedMiners! Stand by your own country. Miners! Stand by Britain. Do not be misled by Communists who want to destroy the democratic way of life. Those are the words of the honourable gentlemen sitting opposite. because I have saved the most powerful statement to the last, we have the declaration of the 1948 conference of the LabouT party. I am not clear, and am open to correction, about whether the declaration came from the Victorian branch of the party or its federal body, but that does not matter because in any event it is a powerful statement. It was printed in 1949 by the Victorian branch with its constitution and its platform, and I quote from pages 66 and 67 of that Labour party publication. I ask honourable members to listen to these words carefully. They refer to the position of the Australian Labour party. They have perhaps, in that respect, a limited application, but as a denunciation of real communism the declaration would be hard Afr. Menzies. to improve upon. Here are the passages^Conference declares the Communist party to be an organization receiving both its inspiration and its major directives from the Russian Communist party, and warns members of the Australian Labour party and its affiliated organizations that Communist policy towards both the defence and the economic rehabilitation of Australia is governed by other than Australian considerations. This situation is emphasized by increasing evidence of a plan for the obstruction of economic recovery and the promotion of social disorder. Such endeavours to destroy the influence the Australian Labour party and thereby prevent the democratic accomplishment of reform are an integral part of world for the creation of economic disorder and weakening of democratic institutions, as a prerequisite for a revolutionary seizure of State power, Government by Communist dictatorship, and ruthless constitute an indictment of communism right here in Australia, so severe and so profound in its implications that I cannot believe that any party that propounded them could say to the people about whom it expressed them, "" But all the same, you may go free to do your work and to occupy whatever place you choose to occupy from which to do it "" . The passage continuedThe conspiratorial nature of the Communist organization with its secret factions in other Finally, bodies, calls for the greatest loyalty and vigilance by members of the Australian Labour party and its affiliated organizations. The Communist philosophy uses both falsehood and chicanery as instruments of penetration and domination. Here is the final summing-upWithin the democratic constitution of the Australian Labour party there exists adequate scope for discussion and dissent. There can be no scope for sabotage and treachery. Nor, in view of the gravity of international outlook, can there be any excuse for members ot the Australian Labour party, however well meaning, who permit themselves to be actively associated with Communist influences directed against the Australian Labour party, the Commonwealth Labour Government and the Australian nation. Those were the words of the Australian Labour party in 1948. Now, that great party presents itself with its own dilemma in dealing with the bill before the House. It has categorically admitted that the Communists are disloyal; that they are wreckers; that they are directed from outside Australia; that they are engineering to create economic chaos and social disorder; that they are bent on destroying democratic institutions; that they are aiming at a revolutionary seizure of state power; that they are enemies of civil liberty; that they are conspirators, and that their weapons are falsehood, chicanery and sabotage. Those are the words of the Labour party. And yet, we are told, although we have not yet been told by His Majesty's Opposition in this Parliament, that whatever else may be done to those enemies of Australia, they are to be untouchable if they bear office in a trade union. They are apparently not to be untouchable if they bear office under the Commonwealth, which represents the whole of the people. The immunity that has been claimed for them in some quarters is to attach to them as office-bearers, not under the whole community, but in a particular organization. Surely, it must be clear to all honourable members that the more skilfully the Communist in a trade union, carrying out the Communist tactics to which I have just referred, plays his cards for office and power, the more likely he is to delude many of his follow trade unionists into voting for him. Indeed, that kind of delusion is his business. Yet, if he is sufficiently skilful in his destructive task, we are told, though as yet not in this House, that the unions, or some of them, will regard this as a good reason why the community should leave him alone with all his power and special facilities for working out his evil designs. The Government cannot believe that that represents the sober judgment of the Australian wage-earnerThe next recital in the bill isAnd whereas the Australian Communist bers in relation to others of His Majesty's party is an integral part of the world communist revolutionary movement, which, in the Dominions. The Canadian royal comKing's dominions and elsewhere, engages in mission disclosed a grievous state of espionage and sabotage and in activities or affairs which indicated that espionage in operations of a treasonable or subversive nature that dominion had assumed great and and also engages in activities or operations similar to those, or having an object similar deadly dimensions. The recent trial of to the object of those, referred to in the last Dr. Fuchs in Great Britain disclosed two preceding paragraphs of this preamble. circumstances of a precisely similar kind. Communism is not an Australian Certainly, the Australian Labour party phenomenon only. It is a world movehad no illusion on this point on the 14th ment. In its principal home-and let us be candid about this matter-it is the prime mover in the world's present disorders and want of peace, and the prime cause of the fears which now distract hundreds of millions of peace-loving people all over the world. The point of view of the Russian Communists has been admirably stated in a report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the United States House of Representatives issued by the American State Department in 1948 under the title The Strategy and Tactics of World Communism. I shall read one passage only from that report, because it sums up the position. It is as follows:An examination of all aspects of Soviet and Communist policy and tactics leads directly to some simple conclusions1. The Communists have one goal-worl d revolution. 2. They assume that the revolution will be violent. 3. They are incapable of accepting the idea that peace can endure from now on, and they expect one more catastrophic war. 4. The Soviet Union is regarded as the main force of the revolution. 5. They fear a coalition against the Soviet Union. -6. They therefore fear reconstruction or federation in the non-Communist world. 7. They utilize the most modern and effective means of cold warfare to strengthen their own forces and to weaken all others. 8. The Communist parties outside the Soviet Union are junior partners or auxiliaries. 9. The tactics are based upon a definite theory, and the central propositions of that theory do not change. That is a report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives of the United States of America. I need not dwell on events that are fresh in the minds of honourable mem* May., 1947, when its Federal Executive which under this legislation the Goverpassed a resolution in these terms:The Federal Executive of the Australian claim. In the considered judgment of His Labour party congratulates the Prime Majesty's Government in Australia it Minister that is my friend, the Leader of the to leave revolutionary Communists in Opposition-and Dr. Evatt on the firm stand taken by with all their smallness of numbers the Government against the proposed black they may achieve destructive results ban on the rocket range project. It is apparent which five army corps could hardly hope that the propaganda recently issued by the to achieve. Communist party in connection with this undertaking is for the sole purpose of defeating the Australian defence policy in the. interests of a foreign power. The Australian Labour party did not stop with that resolution of its Federal Executive, because the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt), who is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and who was then Attorney-General wrote a pamphlet in which he undertook to prove, and did prove, exactly the same thing. The next recital of the bill isAnd whereas certain industries are vital to the security and defence of Australia (includof strikes, mostly political, many of ing the coal-mining industry, the iron and steel industry, the engineering industry, the building industry, the transport industry and the power industry). That recital calls for no argument. The security and defence of Australia are dependent not only upon the valour of our troops in time of war and upon the industry with which they are supported in the factory and on the farm, but also upon the continuity of those great industries that are vital to a national effort should war come. It is a childish idea that the fifth column springs miraculously into existence when a war i? On. It is carefully prepared and organized in advance. By strike and sabotage, it conducts its own cold-war and the success of that war depends upon the strength, or weakness, of the community in which it operates. We would not have tolerated a fifth column in Aus„ do not propose to tolerate one in 1950, at a time when militant communism, checked foT the time being in Western Europe, is moving east and south-east to carry out its plans to put down democracy and to usher in the revolution. Coal-mining, iron and steel, engineering, transport, building and power are key industries. There may well be others Air. Menzies. nor-General may from time to time prowould be an act of criminal folly key positions in those industries so that The next recital isAnd whereas activities or operations of, or encouraged by, the Australian Communist party, and activities or operations of, or encouraged by, members or officers of that party, and other persons who are Communists, are designed to cause, by means of strikes or stoppages of work, and have, by those means, caused dislocation, disruption or retardation of production or work in those vital industries. That has only to be stated to prove itself to any Australian who, since the end of the war, has witnessed a series them against governments or government authorities, and obviously designed to dislocate production, to accelerate inflation-mak e no mistake, it is part of the considered Communist technique to accelerate inflation-and so to break down the existing social, business and industrial order. It will be recalled-indeed , I hope that it has not been forgotten-that until Russia was brought into the recent war by Hitler's invasion, the Australian Communist party was opposed to the war, that it did its best to sabotage the war effort and that it denounced the war as "" an imperialist, capitalist struggle for supremacy"". I hope that we shall not forget that right through the vital stages of the Battle for Britain, and at a time when our own troops were performing immortal exploits of courage and endurance in the Middle tralia from 1939 to 1945. We, certainly, East, the Australian Communists were our mortal enemies, and that it was only when Russia came in, after being invaded, that they decided that patriotism was to be their new line. When the war was over, they reverted to type. The Communists in Australia may get a few dupes of both sexes to sit on their platform, to attend their bogus peace conferences and demonstrations and to put out stupid and pernicious propaganda to the effect that the Soviet Union is the only friend of peace and that its territorial aggressions in the last six years which, perhaps, are unequalled in history, ought to be regarded as friendly gestures. But the truth is that once more the Australian Communists are, in the words of the Australian Labour party Declaration, creating "" economic chaos, social disorder and weakening of democratic institutions as a prerequisite to the revolutionary seizure of State power"". I turn now to the operative provisions of the bill. I shall sum them up sufficiently to convey them to the House by saying that the bill does six main things. First, it declares the Australian Communist party unlawful, dissolves it, and appoints a receiver of its property. If there is any surplus over liabilities, that surplus will be paid into the Commonwealth. Secondly, the bill deals with affiliated associations or bodies controlled by the Communists, though from these bodies are excluded trade unions. We are not going to suggest that a trade union should be dissolved because its management committee happens to have a majority of Communists on it. A trade union of itself is a legitimate organization and, therefore is excluded from these provisions. Leaving the trade unions apart, these provisions deal with bodies controlled by the Communists and bodies advocating communism in a way that I shall describe. Honourable members may be interested to know that one of the bodies associated with communism, the Eureka Youth League, has gone to the ingenuity-it seems to have a lawyer in its ranks-to show that the league is not affiare not within this net, prove it, because, liated with the Communist party, but that the Communist party has affiliated itself with the league. It has gone round the corner to get over a difficulty, but that will not help it because clause 5 of the bill deals with bodies affiliated with the Communists and bodies controlled, in effect, by Communists as well as bodies advocating communism. That clause does two things, and about this we must be clear. Where the Governor General finds a body of that kind and he is satisfied that its continued existence would be prejudicial to the defence or to the execution or maintenance of the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth-that is that the body answers the description; and, secondly, that the -Governor General is satisfied that its existence is prejudicial to the existence of the country-h e may declare that body unlawful and appoint a receiver of its property. Any body so declared--othe r than the Communist party, of course, because under this measure that party is being disposed of with no right of appeal and no humbugmay appeal to the High Courr; and the onus is placed upon that body to satisfy the court that it is not a body to which this legislation applies. Let us face up to that, because it will be suggested by some people of liberal mind -and I appreciate their attitude-that to reverse the onus of proof is wrong. I have only to remind the House that in time of war we have not hesitated to do that very thing. In time of actual shooting war we have not hesitated to use Executive discretions against which there was no appeal at all. We are not now dealing with ordinary private litigation or with the ordinary domestic laws of the country. In this bill we are dealing with a conspiracy against the life of this country, and if we are going to deal #ith that in a realistic sense it would be foolish to expose to the Communists all our material and sources of information and knowledge of those who are conducting these investigations. Nothing would suit the Communists better. This is one of those few occasions on which it is right to say to a man who is declared, or to a body which is declared, "" If you want to demonstrate that you after all, you should be the one who knows the facts "". Thirdly, the bill provides that officers and members of unlawful associationsthat is to say, any of those associations with which I have been dealing-ar e under penalty of imprisonment to cease their activities as such. They are not to seek any direct or indirect support for any unlawful association, or carry on any activity in which that association was engaged. Fourthly, the bill provides that where the Governor General is satisfied that after the 10th May, 1948, and before the dissolution of an association a person was a member or officer of it, and any activities of that person are likely to be prejudicial to defence or to the execution and maintenance of the Constitution or laws of the Commonwealth, His Excellency may make and publish a declaration accordingly. Let me cite a specific example and for that purpose use the name "" John Smith"" as describing nobody in particular. John Smith was a member of the Australian Communist party after the 10th May, 1948, and before the Communist party had been dissolved by this legislation. In addition, if the Governor General is satisfied that John Smith is a person whose activities-no t his past views, but his activities-ar e likely to be prejudicial to defence or to the execution and the maintenance of the Constitution or laws of the Commonwealth, His Excellency will proclaim that fact by declaration, and his proclamation will go out to the world. John Smith, having been so declared in the Gazette, may appeal to the High Court. In making his appeal he will have the onus of satisfying the court that he was not, at any material time, a member or officer of the association in question. What happens to him when he is declared? That is covered by the fifth principal provision in the bill. A declared person who answers to those two descriptions-first , that he is a Communist; and, secondly, that his activities are prejudicial to the defence of this country-shal l be disqualified from employment by the Commonwealth or by a Commonwealth authority. As far as the Commonwealth services are concerned he will be "" gone "". We have not undertaken to deal with State employment for obvious reasons. State governments and State Parliaments can attend to State employment as such. That, after all, is why the views of the State governments on this matter are of very great importance. I now turn momentarily to the position of organizations. If the Governor General-and, know, that means the Governor General in Council-is satisfied that a substantial number of the members of an industrial organization are engaged in what I shall call key industries-one of those industries to which I have referred such as coal-mining, iron and steel, building, Sir. Menzies. engineering and so on-o r in some other industry which in the opinion of theGovernor-General is vital to the security and defence of Australia, His Excellency may declare that organization accordingly. I shall cite an example. The Governor General may declare that he is satisfied that a substantial number of the members of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association are engaged in what he regards as a key industry. He thereupon declares that association. Nothing happens to the association. It is merely declared to be an organization a substantial number of the members of which are engaged in a key industry. No disability is imposed on it. The important result of the declaration is that a declared person, John Smith, to whom I have referred, who has been declared in the Gazette to be a person whose activities are likely to be prejudicial to defence or the execution and maintenance of the Constitution or laws of the Commonwealth, is thereupon disqualified from holding office in that organization or any branch of it. To sum up, such a declared person cannot hold oifice in a declared organization associated with a key industry. In effect, a Communist whose activities are likely to prejudice the defence or the orderly government of Australia is to be debarred from holding office under the Crown or in an organization which is concerned with activities that are vital to the security of the country. In other words, the enemies of the peace of the country are not to be allowed to occupy positions in which they can give the greatest effect to their evil designs. I should add that the date-the 10th May, 1948-ha s been selected because it was the last day of the National Congress of the Australian Communist party by which the constitution of that party was adopted. Not one of us in this House has any love for retrospective legislation. But quite as honourable members clearly, as a matter of plain horse sense, if this bill dealt only with those who could be shown to be Communist party members on the date on which this bill becomes an act obviously there would then be no party members or officers to be affected by it and the legislation would be a complete futility. We are not prepared to facilitate a farce of that kind. Our Communist enemies are known; they have been active at least since the selected date, the 10th May, 1948, and they come within the purview of the bill accordingly. The whole matter can be summed up in this way: If the recitals in the preamble of the bill are in substance true, its operative provisions are most obviously just and reasonable. If the recitals are in substance, false, then, not only is the bill unjust, but also the Dean of Canterbury is right, the North Atlantic Pact is mere hysteria and both British and American policy are wickedly wrong. We are now bound to make our choice. adjourned. BILL 1950. In committee: Consideration resumed (vide page 1994). Clause 7-Proposed new sections 9B (Management of the Bank); and 9o (Bank and Treasury to establish liaison). the Opposition) [9.26] -Sub-sectio n (3.) of proposed new section 9B, which contains perhaps the most important of the provisions now before the committee, reads as follows:(3.) In the management of the Bank, the Governor shall act in accordance with the policy of the Bank and with any directions of the Board. The operation of that provision will depend upon those that have already been agreed to by the committee. The Opposition wishes to make it perfectly clear that it will oppose every provision in this bill which relates to the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank Board. I have spoken at some length on that proposal and I do not intend to repeat what I have already said. I was interested to hear certain statements made by Government spokesmen during the earlier stages of the committee debate, in particular those made by the Minister for National Development ( Mr (3.) of proposed section 9B unless they Casey). New members who, with the blessing of the press, have come into this chamber to raise the dignity of the Parliament could not have been edified by the language used by the right honourable gentleman. He is a senior Minister and therefore his views cannot be disregarded. The right honoraible gentleman has indicated that he would select for appointment to the Commonwealth Bank Board, and to other boards that may be established by the Government, men who had no knowledge of the subject with which they would have to deal. He has said that a very distinguished gentleman, the Chief Justice of South Australia, and another gentleman of high standing in the world of economics who is attached to the University of Sydney, have no knowledge of the subject of banking. He has indicated that in the past he had selected for appointment to boards established by the Government of the day persons who had no knowledge of the work that they were called upon to do. 1 do not think that a more remarkable statement has ever been made in this Parliament by a responsible Minister. The committee has already dealt with the establishment and functions of the Commonwealth Bank Board. It is now dealing with provisions relating to the management of the bank and the liaison that shall exist between the bank and the Treasury. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to confine his remarks to the proposed new sections under discussion. ing, Mr Chairman. I was leading up to the fact that under sub-section (3.) of proposed new section 9n, the Governor of the Bank will be obliged to take directions from at least five men who know nothing at all about the subject of banking. I make no attack on. the personal character of those men. I merely point out that the Governor of the Bank, who is skilled in national and international economics and banking practice will be forced to accept directions from men who know nothing about those abstruse subjects. I do not know what is meant by the words ""the policy of the bank"" in sub-section infer the bank board itself. If that is so it means that the policy of the bank is to be laid down by the bank board. I do not want to depart from your ruling, Mr Chairman, in the slightest sense.

214,Mr Chifley,"I accept your rulconsidered that this matter can be more adequately dealt with under PartV . of the bill I shall not make any further remarks on it at present. I think it has been admitted by members of the Opposition that the present Governor of the Bank and the previous Governor of the Bank-wh o was appointed not by a Labour party but by a Conservative Government-were men skilled in the art of banking. The Governor is to be told what to do in regard to bankingI use the expression again-by someone called in off the street for one day a month. Under this proposal the board will learn as it goes along. The bank boards that were previously appointed to direct the policy of the bank operated from 1924 until 1931 and learnt nothing about banking. And apparently the Conservative Government of this country also has learned nothing about banking because the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) pointed out in his speech that the mistake was that the Governor was not chairman of the bank board. It has taken from 1924 until 1950 for certain elements in this community to realize that the Governor is the proper person to be the principal officer of the bank. Under this proposed section, the principal authority is to be the bank board. Because the Commonwealth Bank Board will direct the central banking activities of this country as well as the trading bank activities of the Commonwealth Bank, the Opposition must oppose that portion of the bill. [9.35] -In view of the remarks made by the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Freeth) earlier this evening, a close analysis of this portion of the bill is desirable. Sub-section (3.) of proposed section 9B Taises two doubts in my mind and I believe that if the honourable member for Forrest was sincere in advocating parliamentary control of banking he would find himself in the same position. The sub-section readsIn the management of the Bank the Governor nhall act in accordance with the policy of the The reason why the Governor of the Bank That is the first pointand with any directions of the Board. I ask the honourable member for Forrest to remember what has gone before when considering this sub-section. The committee, by its decision, has affirmed the proposal to appoint a bank board. It has agreed to the determination of policy by the board. Finally we have arrived at what must be regarded as the final slamming of the door on any possibility of the Government having any control over the board either through the Treasurer or otherwise until such time as a decision has been reached by the board. That is the danger in the whole of these proposals and is the reason why honourable members of the Opposition are so much opposed to them. I am astonished that members of the Australian Country party support this measure. Immediately the bank board has been constituted it will be able to decide to revert to some international policy in respect of internal or international exchange and neither the Australian Country party, the Treasurer, nor the Government will have a voice in the matter, either in determining the policy or in an advisory capacity, until after the decision has been made. This sub-'section confirms that fact. If the honourable member for Forrest examines it he will find that this proposed section slams the door finally against any parliamentary control of the decisions to be made by the proposed board. Sub-section (3.) provides that the Governor shall act in accordance with any directions of the board. I do not think anybody will deny that leading articles in the Sydney Morning Herald are usually on the side of the Government; yet that journal published the following comment in a leading article on the 17th March, 1950, in respect of the proposal that the head of the bank shall be subject to the provisions of this subsection :Thus the head of the bank is to have his own subordinates at each board meeting laying down instructions which he must carry out. In practice, either the Governor must dominate the proceedings or else intolerable friction will arise within the bank itself. That is what will be affirmed if this subsection is adopted in its present form. bank should have some overriding authority is obvious. I agree with the honourable member for Forrest that there should be collaboration between the Government, through the Treasurer, and",61,Commonwealth Bank
215,Mr E. James Harrison (Blaxland),"tlie Governor of the Commonwealth Bank because the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank will not otherwise be in a position to know what is happening in respect of international financial matters. It must be accepted, particularly in these days of fluctuating world finances, that the Treasurer will receive confidential insection 9A was being considered, and it formation that could not possibly be placed before a part-time board. Because of that fact, the proposed board will not be capable of making sound decisions. If the committee approves of this subsection it will slam the door finally on the very thing for which some honourable members on the Government side have been clamouring during this debate, that is, parliamentary control over decisions of the bank board. Is it to be wondered at that honourable members opposite were challenged this afternoon to indicate clearly their real position in regard to the other sections ? On this sub-section, it is easy to state the position. Honourable members of the Opposition agree with the consensus of opinion that parliamentary intrusion into the affairs of banking is necessary. Under the provisions of the 1945 legislation that was possible. Those provisions do not correspond with the provisions of this proposed section because, under them the Treasurer will have no voice until the decision has been made. Under the 1945 act the bank had to advise the Treasurer of its policy. In the event of difference of opinion and failure to reach agreement the Government made the decision and the bank had to give effect to it.

I thought that he was speaking of the Government when in fact he was referring to the Governor of the bank. MrE . JAMESHARRISON I thank you, Mr Chairman. I was trying to keep to the point, which is that the proposed section provides for the Governor to be instructed by the board but makes no provision whatever for any relationship between the board and the Treasurer or between the board and the Government before any decision of the board is imposed upon the Governor. For that reason, I oppose the proposal and urge the Government to reconsider its decision. honourable member's time has expired. [Quorum formed.] bers of the Opposition have been accused throughout the discussion of this measure of repeatedly going back to the days of 1930 and suggesting that this legislation will, in fact, re-establish the state of affairs that then existed.

Proposed section 9B (3.) stateaIn the management of the Bank, the Governor shall act in accordance with the policy of the Bank and with any directions of the That provides for a complete reversion to the situation that existed in 1930, because there is very little distinction between the management of the bank and the making of; decisions in relation.",62,Commonwealth Bank

221,Mr Keon (Yarra) [9.48],"Memto the policy of the bank. Let us consider who is to be directed and who is to do the directing. Under the 1945 banking legislation of the Chifley Government, tbe Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is supreme in the management of the bank. He is unfettered except in the event of a conflict arising with the Treasurer in relation to matters of policy. In other words, a person employed full time in the management of the bank, an expert in close touch with day to day financial and economic developments overseas that have any bearing upon Australia's economic affairs, is in control of the bank. He is prohibited by statute from having any outside interests that could possibly conmade by that independent gentleman, flict with his interest and duties as Governor of the bank. He must not engage in industry or commerce. This Government now proposes to give to a board the power to direct that gentleman, who is independent of private interests. The board will have ten members-''te n little nigger boys""-of whom at least five will represent outside interests. In accordance with the intention of the Government, they will be business men interested in industry and commerce. Obviously their outside interests will conflict with their interests as members of the board that will determine the policy and the management of the bank. I do not say that in derogation of their honesty or integrity. The Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) has announced in this chamber and also through the press that one purpose of the proposed change in the control of the Commonwealth Bank is to enable the private banks to function free of many of the restrictions that have been imposed upon them by the 1945 legislation. member is rather wide of the mark. He should be discussing the management of the Commonwealth Bank. management of the bank is so closely bound up with the determination and . administration of policy that it is very difficult to separate the two subjects. dealt with the subject of policy when it that I have mentioned must be made considered proposed section 9A, and that discussion cannot be revived. my remarks to the management of the Commonwealth Bank, one aspect of which must be the continued operation of its many branches in competition with private banks and its continued expansion, as proposed by the previous administration and by the present Governor functioning under the 1945 legislation. The Government now proposes, through this bill,' that any decisions in relation to the expansion of the Commonwealth Bank in competition with the private banks that may be protected by law against outside interests and prohibited by law from having outside interests, may be overruled by the ""ten little nigger boys"" of the proposed board, five of whom will be interested in outside industry and commerce and therefore in the decisions that will be made by the board. Those men will have a personal interest in the bank's policy in relation to advances for home building and the interest rates that it is likely to charge. Such matters are vitally bound up with the management of the bank. Under the 1945 legislation, the Governor can make decisions on matters of that nature completely free of outside influence, but can we be certain that the five members of the board who will be appointed by the Government to represent industry and commerce will be free of any interest in private building societies or other financial institutions that are competing directly with the Commonwealth Bank in making advances for home building ? member is discussing policy, not management, and I shall not allow him to continue to do so.

Under that arrangement there has been perfect harmony between the Governor and the Government. The appointment of a board with power to direct the Governor is a retrograde step, and is in keeping with the policy of past anti-Labour administrations which only in times of national crisis such as war have been prepared to allow the Commonwealth Bank to remain under the sole control of. the Governor. During World War I. the Commonwealth Bank, under the Governorship of Sir Denison Miller, rendered yeoman service to the people of this country. Similarly, during World War II. the resources of the bank were used to the fullest degree in the interests determined by a board of trained people. of this country-treasur y bills amounting to £400,000,000 were issued-bu t now that the period of reconstruction has been reached, a change in the administration of the bank is sought to be made by the Government. This, as I have said, is a retrograde step which will shatter the people's bank. The Commonwealth Bank will once again be a bankers' bank, as it was described on one occasion by the Melbourne Age. Clearly, the Government's aim in making this change in the control of the bank is to ensure that it shall be administered in future in accordance with the Government's policy; The Commonwealth Bank is vital to the development of this country but it is clear from the remarks of the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) and the Minister for Development ( Mr Casey) that the resources of the bank are not to be used fox developmental purposes. matter has no relation to the proposed sub-sections under consideration. Mr Chairman, but I submit that by tying the hands of the Governor, proposed new section 9B will cripple the bank and hamper the developmental programmes of not only the Australian Government but also the State Governments. If the administration of the bank were to remain under the control of the Governor, the bank's resources would be utilized to the fullest possible extent in the national interests. that a number of Opposition speakers have been unable to confine their remarks to the portion of the bill now under consideration shows how "" woolly"" their thinking is on this measure. The last three speakers have been unable to appreciate the difference, between policy and management. To my mind, proposed section 9B is simple and straightforward. It provides for the appointment of a Governor and a Deputy Governor who will carry out the policy laid down by the board. This system is on all fours with that operating in the business world. In most companies, policy matters are As the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) pointed out in his second-reading speech, overseas banks such as the reserve banks of South Africa, India and New Zealand are managed by a board of directors. He said that the Bank of England, although it was nationalized in 194'6, retained the system of management by a board. Nobody in his senses would suggest that the managing director of an ordinary limited liability company should himself lay down the policy of the company. Policy must be decided on the timer' honoured principle that several heads are better than one. It is on that system that this particular section has been framed. The policy to be laid down will be carried out by the Governor in his official capacity, the details of management being left in his hands. The several members of the board will decide the policy that he,, or in his absence the Deputy Governor, shall carry out. The That matter of liaison is fully covered by proposed section 9o which states clearly that the Governor of the bank and the Secretary to the Treasury shall establish close liaison and keep each other fully informed on all relevant points.

239,Mr Drury (Ryan) [10.4],"The fact-Section 9 of the 1945 act dealt entirely with differences arising on policy between the Treasurer and the bank board. It is proposed to repeal the whole of that section and to substitute new sections. The matter of differences of opinion between the Governor and the bank board has been dealt with, and I shall now deal with the management of the bank. Under this bill the management of the bank is not to be the sole responsibility of the Governor. I should think that if a board is to be established, then it will decide matters of policy, and the management of the bank will be left to the Governor. But under proposed section 9B the management is to be shared by the Governor and the board. I think that is wrong. The proposed -section readsIn the management of the Bank, the Governor shall act in accordance with the policy words seem meaningless. of the Bank and with any directions of the Board. The speaker who preceded me mentioned the conduct of private business, and said that boards of directors manage such concerns. I have not been a member of a board of directors and I do no know exactly what they do, but I presume that the title of managing director connotes management and the carrying out of policv laid down by the board of directors. I should think that the responsibility of a managing director to the board of directors is complete in regard to management. interference in the ordinary affairs of management by a body which meets once a fortnight or once a month. I do not think that the Commonwealth Bank could continue to function if the board, at infrequent meetings, attended by public servants, bank officials and part-time directors, was to concern itself with the ordinary affairs of management. Let us consider what the affairs of management might be. They might concern a big overdraft to a large company, or a matter not of interest policy. They might be concerned with differential rates of interest to be charged in special cases. Such management might concern the giving of a benefit to Borne firms or some individuals in the light of certain circumstances which did [67] not apply generally. I submit that such matters are for the Governor and the Deputy Governor to deal with, and will only clutter up tbe work of the board if it is given the responsibility of management as well as the direction of policy. I take it from the speech of the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) that the board should sit with the Governor and deal with decisions of policy and management. Under the present act the Governor has an Advisory Council which deals only with matters of policy. The sole management of the bank, under the 1945 act, is vested in the Governor, and through him in the Deputy Governors who manage the various departments of the bank. Proposed section 9c mentions the necessity of establishing a close liaison between the Governor and the Secretary to the Treasury. Those Surely a close liaison exists between the Governor and the Secretary to the Treasury while the latter is a member of the board. Surely the association cannot be made any closer by a further provision. The"" liaison "" is not defined at all. The provision merely states that a liaison shall be established between these two gentlemen and that each shall keep the other fully informed of all matters which jointly concern the bank and the Department of the Treasury., How is this liaison to operate? Are the two officers to telephone each other There would be no at 9 o'clock every morning, or write a letter to each other every evening, or consult once a week or fortnight? How close is this closeness to be, and who is to define how close it shall be? If the Governor, in his wisdom or lack of it, does not want a close association with the Secretary to the Treasury and ceases to communicate with him, what provision is there to compel the Governor to take the advice or to obtain the opinion of the Secretary to the Treasury in any matter which presumably it is intended to cover by this provision of dose liaison? All matters relating to the differential treatment of the clients of a bank are within the province of bankers and not the Secretary to the Treasury, or those estimable people who will be taken off the street, be made directors of the bank and be kept in",66,Commonwealth Bank
240,Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [10.7].,"office for periods up to five years. In other formulate the policy of the board. They proposed sections provision is made for the appointment of these gentlemen for five years. I am concerned that if management and policy become intermingled the bank might be prevented from carrying on its work. Ten people wishing to express opinions on management will not be so useful or effective as two. It is always better to have one person as manager because then you can depend on unanimity of decision. If ten people are to decide on matters of management decisions will be made by a show of hands, and it is possible that persons experienced in the business of the bank will be overridden by others who are inexperienced in the management of such a large institution. When considering what has happened in the past we discover that many eminent people in the field of commerce, industry and trade union management, have sat with the Governor of the bank. I do not think that any of them interfered in the actual work of management. I believe that a board is normally associated with a governor but the members of the bank board let the governor .decide such matters. the 1924 act there was no provision that the board should manage the Commonwealth Bank. I conclude by stating that for the reasons I have given I consider that the passage of the proposed new sections would be a retrograde step. opposing the insertion of proposed new section 9B the Opposition is hard pressed to find any arguments that are either relevant or cogent. .The right honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr manages the ordinary business of the Chifley) erroneously said that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is liable to be badly directed by some one called in off the street on one day a month. The plain fact is that there is to be a board of ten directors and that the Governor of the bank is to be the chairman of that board. In addition to the chairman four other members of the bank board will be public servants, two of whom will be Professor Melville, the economic adviser to the bank, and Dr. Roland Wilson, the Commonwealth Statistician. Those men will help to will be in continuous consultation and five other men, who will be chosen for their general competence and ability, will assist them. It is clear, therefore, that the statement of the right honourable member for Macquarie that the Governor of the bank will be in a position inferior to that of the other members of the board is incorrect. The Governor, as a member of the board, will have right and status at least equal to those of other members. I think that the right honourable gentleman will agree that the technical experts who will join the board will be at least the equal of Dr. Coombs. Therefore, I say that that part of the argument of the right honourable gentleman falls completely to the ground. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) discussed the matter of management, and said that the management of the bank is to be handed over to irresponsible outsiders. That statement indicates how difficult it is for honourable members opposite to remain cogent in this matter, because the proposed new section specifically In states that "" the bank shall be managed by the Governor"". The management of the bank, including the appointment of staff, the day-to-day operations of -banking, including the making of decisions concerning large advances, and all such matters will be in the hands of the Governor of the bank or, perhaps, it would be more correct to say in the hands of the Deputy Governor of the -bank. Everyone who has had anything to do with the Commonwealth Bank knows that the Deputy Governor bank. He attends to all important staff matters, supervises the activities and efficiency of officers of the bank, and generally manages the day-to-day operations of the bank. However, matters of overall policy, such as the fixing of interest rates, the nature of the security on which advances are to be made, and a dozen other matters will be attended to by the board. There is a clear-cut distinction between management and policy. Management will be in the hands of the permanent oflicials of the bank, whereas policy will",67,Commonwealth Bank
241,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe) [10.15],"I nbe directed by those who will be appointed to give advice as occasion demands. The honourable member for Melbourne in referring to proposed new section 9o committed a foolish blunder. He asked whether the Governor and the Secretary to the Department of the Treasury are to have liaison every month or once every week. The simple fact is that they have day-to-day liaison, and that that has been the practice ever since the banking legislation of 1945 was passed. Any one who has any knowledge of the internal working of the Commonwealth Bank or of the Government knows that Dr. Coombs, as the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, maintains the closest liaison with the Secretary to the Treasury, as also does the Deputy Governor of the bank. They do not restrict themselves to any fixed rules in their associafriend the honourable member for tion because they maintain that intimate relationship which is so essential in the conduct of any great commercial concern. Proposed new section 9B is, of course, a might also be appointed to the board. subsidiary one. If one accepts the idea of board management then one must accept section 9B in to to. If one rejects the powers proposed to be conferred on the board under sub-section (2.) of proposed section 9 then one must necessarily reject the powers proposed to be conferred under proposed section 9 B ; consequently, I do not think that proposed section 9B should receive the great amount of attention that has been devoted to it. That section provides for the appointment of senior executive officers. It also provides that those senior executive officers shall have the power of management Bank. Proposed section 9 (2.), which is a complementary provision, vests in the Commonwealth Bank Board the power to determine the policy of the Commonwealth Bank, and provides that the management of the bank shall always be subject to the policy enunciated by the board. Proposed section 9c merely provides that there shall be the closest liaison between the Treasury officials and the Commonwealth Bank Board, in order to ensure that the Government shall always be properly advised on matters of financial and monetary policy. It is not possible to raise substantial obparty, which walks arm in arm with .the jections to those provisions, because they are logical and sensible. I wholeheartedly support their adoption. [10.22] I oppose the proposals under discussion because they will have the effect of compelling the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to act in accordance with the policy of the board and to comply with any directions of the board. If we compel the Governor of the bank to act entirely in accordance with the directions of the board I have a pretty good idea of what will happen, which is that, through the Commonwealth Bank Board, the private banks will direct the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to carry out some of the most diabolical policies that we have known. I can quite imagine the kind of board that will be appointed by the present administration. My Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) might even be appointed a member of the board, and Mr Isaacson, of the Bank of Adelaide, Can honourable members imagine a more dastardly act of parliament than one that would compel the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to obey the decisions of a bank board composed of people such as the two gentlemen I have mentioned? I can assure the committee that if it accepts proposed section 9B, which includes a provision to compel the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to carry out the decisions of the Commonwealth Bank Board, we shall have little hope of averting another depression, and when it comes we shall have still less chance of alleviating its consequences. The Governor of the Commonwealth of the Commonwealth Bank should be completely independent of the "" stooges"" who are likely to be appointed to the board. member think that he will be appointed to the board? hope of that, because I represent the ordinary people, such as the farmers and the industrial workers of the country.

The honourable member for Hindmarsh The present Governor has ( Mr Clyde Cameron) has warned the committee about the sinister method that the Government is employing in order to deprive the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank of his authority in the management of that institution. Emphasis has been placed by Government supporters upon the fact that, .in future, the management of the bank will continue to be exercised by Dr. Coombs, who was appointed by a Labour administration. Some of them have described him as a doctrinaire socialist, and have cast certain reflections upon his ability, It is a pernicious proyet they have stressed at all. times that, as he was appointed by the previous Government, the Opposition should not object to proposed new section 9B, because he will continue to control the management of the bank. The real motive of the Government in retaining him in that position is revealed in proposed new section 9B (3.), which reads as follows:In the management of the Bank, the Governor shall act in accordance with the policy of the Bank and with any directions of the Board. In other words, his wings will be clipped, and he will be deprived of his Those vested influence.

They are somewhat envious of the successful administration of a man who was appointed by a Labour government, and they now seek to undermine that institution, as they have always attempted to do, to reduce its efficiency and to substitute influences that are not conducive to the welfare of the nation. I refer, of course, to the representatives of the private banks and of big business. When they are appointed to the bank board, they will remove from the Commonwealth Bank its control of the monetary policy of the nation. Under proposed section 9B the Governor must act in accordance with the policy of the bank and any directions of the board. I mention in passing that proposed section 9 (2.) providesSubject to this Part, the Board shall have power to determine the policy of the Bank or of the Savings Bank in relation to any matter and to take such action as is necessary to ensure that effect is given by the Bank or the Savings Bank to the policy so determined.

It is significant that no reply has been made to the repeated charges by honourable members on this side of the committee that this is a sinister reprisal against the Labour party for the efficiency that it brought to the Commonwealth Bank when it was in office. There has been no answer by the Government to the charges that the bill is a "" pay off"" to the interests that secured the election of honourable members opposite at the last general election. It is a pay-off for the vicious propaganda in which those interests indulged on behalf of the members of the present Government parties. It is an attempt to make the Commonwealth Bank subject ment the policy of the interests that paid the election expenses of members of the Liberal party and other honourable gentlemen opposite. Let there be no mistake about that. Honourable members on this side of the committee and members of the public who can read between the lines know that the interests that expended money during the general election campaign on behalf of the present Government parties will demand from honourable gentlemen opposite a return for their efforts.

Honourable members on this side of the committee oppose these proposals. We desire our charges to be answered by the Treasurer and not by the Minister for Labour and National Service.

264,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [10.56],"Yet this Government has the audacity to continue to bring to this country hundreds of thousands of additional people. I am not blaming the new settlers. They were probably anxious to escape from very bad conditions in their own countries. However, it is unfair to them and to the Aushomes if the demand continues in excess tralian community in general to continue to bring to Australia large numbers of migrants, when the Government is unable to provide accommodation for the people already in the country. The Minister for ""Works and Housing also enjoys the title of Minister for National Development, although as yet there has been very little indication that there will be any worthwhile development under Liberal governments. They merely send abroad allegedly expert fact-finding committees. That is all that Liberal governments ever do. Is there any wonder that unrest and discontent are growing? I shall mention several other cases that have come to my notice. One is that of two families who are living in two rooms with a kitchenette attached. One family consists of a man, his wife and two childrena boy aged seventeen, and a girl aged eleven years. family consists of a man, his wife, and two children aged two years and one year respectively. families being required to live under such conditions! Another case is that of a mother, her son aged nineteen years, and a married daughter with two children aged three years and two years respectively, who are living in one room with a kitchenette attached. Yet another case is that of four adults, and three children little is being done to ease the position of suffering from asthma, all of whom are living in two small rooms with a kitchenette attached. I have heard of hundreds of cases such as these. I understand that a similar state of affairs exists in all the Australian States. Governments have been unable to provide even emergency accommodation for these people. If this Government wants to prevent the spread of communism in this country it should do something to relieve the housing problem. I could mention people in this country who own mansions that are occupied by only a very few persons. As I am reminded, also, some supporters of the Government own more than one dwelling, Mr Ward. and use them only occasionally. It is of no use to feed the people on statistics about how many displaced persons are being engaged in the building, steel, and associated industries. That will not bring the people any nearer to obtaining of the number produced. The Minister has admitted that our normal requirements are 90,000 homes a year. Only approximately 50,000 homes are being erected each year, so that each year many more unfortunate people are forced to live under unsatisfactory conditions. in which the honourable member was a Minister do about it? administration the production of homes was greatly accelerated. The honourable member who has just interjected can tell his story to the unfortunate people who lodged applications with the various housing commissions over four years ago and have not yet been given the opportunity to secure even emergency accomThe other modation.

Home-building is falling short of the demand, and each year the hopes of thousands of people of securing permanent accommodation are receding. Although Union clubs and Banker's clubs exist in the various States and provide elaborate accommodation for the occasional use of members, the unfortunate people to whom I have referred. Every time honourable members on this side of the House ask what the Government has achieved since its election, Ministers say that petrol rationing has been abolished. That is all that the Government has done in the five months during which it has been in office. It has not passed any legislation. Now it intends to try to distract the attention of the people from the real issues that concern them. The Government is trying to arouse a panic-hysteria in this country.

That can be done only on a substantive motion. done on some other occasion. I repeat that this Government is trying to arouse a wave of hysteria in this country in connection with a matter, the gravity of which I contend has been exaggerated by its supporters. That has been done deliberately to try to make the people forget the conditions under which they are being asked to live by an anti-Labour Administration. It is of no use for honourable members opposite to ask what Labour did about this problem when it was in office. The fact is that this Government was elected on a' programme able member's time has expired. listened with increasing regret to the remarks that have just been made by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr If he directed his suggestion to the approWard). He has attempted to condemn the Government's immigration policy by relating the inflow of migrants to the present shortage of houses. His intention is entirely mischievous. The shortage of houses, of which supporters of the Government are as much aware as are members of the Opposition, is due to a number of causes one of the most important of which is the shortage of labour. The Government's immigration policy in itself will be the means of increasing our labour force and, in the course of time, will thus assist to overcome the housing shortage. Honourable members opposite, of course, are well aware of that fact but the honourable member for East Sydney is seeking to inflame the minds of thoughtless people who may be foolish enough to believe his statement that the inflow of migrants will aggravate the shortage of homes in this country. So long as substantial numbers of migrants are employed in the basic industries and in the building trades, a policy that the Government is pursuing to the greatest possible degree, they will greatly that point, at which I should have had help in the near future to relieve the present shortage of houses. The Chifley honourable Government demonstrated that fact when its Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) made available 200 migrants for employment in the brickmaking industry in New South Wales, with the result that last November the production of bricks in that State was the highest since before the recent war. That is a shining example of the value of the Government's immigration policy which, after all, is a continuation of the policy of the Chifley Government; and I believe that many members of the present Opposition are justifiably proud of the record of the Chifley Government in that respect. It is regrettable, therefore, that the honourable member for East Sydney should seek to destroy that policy in order to serve his own mischievous purposes. Such an attitude can have only the most harmful results for the country as a whole. The honourable member said that many large mansions could be subdivided in order to provide more housing. He knows perfectly well that such action can be taken only by the State Government concerned. priate quarter, he might render some useful service to the community. Instead, he endeavoured to impair the reputation of the Government by charging it with failure to do something that it had no authority to do. Supporters of the Government fully appreciate the effect that the shortage of houses has upon the community. Indeed, housing is one of the most serious problems that exists in Australia to-day. However, the honourable member for East Sydney will not help to solve that problem by making speeches of the kind to which we have just listened. wish to raise a matter, Mr Speaker, which I might have raised under the heading of privilege this morning. However, as it is largely a personal matter I thought that I could ventilate it in some other way.

Consequently, I went to the rear of the building, where I found that the only point of ingress was through the kitchen, the door of which had been left unlocked. I know that the locking of all other external doors was decided by Mr President and yourself; and I intend later to approach Mr President on this matter. However, I should now like to know for how long the present blockade of Parliament House will last, because I have no intention of risking my health in the way that I have indicated, because of circumstances that merely provide a sort of side-show for the Communist party. I am not afraid to .face any band of Communists in any circumstances, but I do not intend to risk impairment of my health merely because some one is afraid that some Communists might gain entry to this building. ""Will you, Mr Speaker, be good enough to inform me when we shall be able to enter and leave the building under normal conditions ? honourable mediately. I hope that conditions relating to the entry to Parliament House will be normal by to-morrow morning. I remind the honourable member that the action to which he has taken exception was decided upon by agreement between Mr President and myself. remind the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), who has just complained about the shortage of houses, that during the closing period of the final session of the last Parliament I brought to the attention of the House the case of a man and his wife and five children who had been living in a tent near Geelong and had been obliged to vacate it while other persons used it during their Christmas holidays. When I cited that case the honourable member who was a Minister in the Chifley Government at that time merely sat in his place in this chamber and grinned. He made no attempt to support my representations with respect to the shortage of housing generally. The greatest political humbug one can meet is the man who, for party political purposes, without a genuine case against the Government, plays upon the sympathies of people who find themselves in difficult circumstances. The honourable member for East Sydney has just given a glowing example of that practice. I remind the Opposition that the present Government has been in office for only five months. What did the Labour governments that were in office for the last eight years do in the direction advocated by the honourable member and if he was not satisfied, why did he not complain earlier ? He complained that the Government was bringing too many migrants to this country. Whilst the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Holt) has said that he intends to reduce the intake of migrants by 50 per cent., the policy of the Chifley Government was to bring to Australia increasing numbers of migrants. Apparently, the honourable member for East Sydney is the only one in step in the Opposition party on this matter. Widespread tributes .have been paid to his colleague, the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) upon his member's question imadministration as Minister for Immigration in the Chifley Government. Even when that Government was in office the honourable member for East Sydney criticized its immigration policy outside the Parliament. Whilst he has been consistent in the attitude that he has adopted to-night, he has not previously spoken in that strain in this House. I have no doubt that had the immigration policy of the Chifley Government, in which he was a Minister, been tested on a division in this chamber, he would have absented himself while the division was being taken. He gave such a performance by absenting himself when a division was taken upon that Government's proposal to approve the Bretton Woods Agreement. He went throughout the country like a lion attacking that proposal, but when the matter was submitted to a vote of the House he acted in as cowardly a fashion as he has acted to-night. honourable member vote on the proposal to approve the Bretton Woods Agreement? after I had told the people my opinion",75,Allowance Films And A Son Aged Six Who Are Living In A Theatre And Garage That Measures 20 Feet By 12 Feet

274,Mr Ttjrnbtjll,"I voted against itof the proposal. I had the courage to stand up to my convictions. No Honourable member opposite can say that the honourable member for East Sydney displayed 'courage on that occasion, and he has not done so in making the remarks that he has just made. It is easy for any honourable member to criticize the present shortage of housing. The honourable member forgets that the Government has been in office for only five months and he completely overlooks the record of the Chifley Government on this subject. When he was a Minister in that Government he did not complain that people within his electorate had been unable to obtain houses. Some new members do not know these things, and it would be better if they kept quiet and listened. When I say that, I have the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) particularly in mind. It is not to the credit of any honourable member to speak as the honourable member for East Sydney did to-night. He asked what could be expected from the present form of government, and made the veiled suggestion that there was another kind of government that might do better. He referred to a speech that had been made earlier this evening, and we can draw our own conclusion as to what he meant. Talk of that kind does not tend to raise the standard of government in Australia. -In to-day's issue of the Adelaide Advertiser there is published an article under the name of the present Minister for the Army( Mr Erancis), but I cannot believe that it correctly states his opinion. I am sorry that the Minister is not present to-night; I believe he is in another State; but the misstatement in the article should be corrected. I quote from it as follows:Australia to the status of a military command is an outcome of the Federal Government's intention to introduce national military service and to intensify recruiting for permanent army units. The Minister for the Army( Mr Francis) said to-day that the strength of both A.R.A. and C.M.F. personnel in South Australia would be increased. That statement is wholly incorrect. BeforeI took office as Minister for the Army, the military districts on the mainland were the Northern Comma: 1, which included Queensland; the Southern Command, which included Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Darwin: the Western Command, which consisted of Western Australia; and the Eastern Command, which consisted of New South Wales. I realized that it was not in the best interests of the defence of South Australia that it should be attached to the Southern Command. When a decision touching South Australia had to be made, the Commandant of the Fourth Military District, which is South Australia, had to get in touch with Southern Command, in Melbourne, which made the decision, and then sent it back to South Australia. I decided that South Australia was entitled to a separate command, and I made representations to that effect to Cabinet which, in due course, decided that South Australia should become the Central Command, by which name it has been known ever since. The change was due to my action, and the nresent Government cannot take any credit for it. Even the most prejudiced critic of the Labour Government, which preceded the present Government, must admit that it was responsible for introducing social benefits of which it has reason to be proud. It attempted to do justice to the indigent, the infirm and the aged, and its action in this regard is remembered with affection by the people concerned. Among the benpfits introduced by the Labour Government was the funeral benefit of £10, and the time has now arrived when the amount should be increased. My electorate consists almost entirely of working-class suburbs) in which live over 3,000 pensioners. To my constituents, social benefits are of great importance. It has been estimated by representatives of the Old-age Pensioners Association that the cost of burial has increased by 36 per cent, during the last three years, although it is difficult to make an exact assessment because such factors as the cost of the casket, and the number of",76,Allowance Films And A Son Aged Six Who Are Living In A Theatre And Garage That Measures 20 Feet By 12 Feet

New South Wales Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania Australian Capital Territory Commonwealth * Includes houses andflatsbut does not Include temporary dwellings or shop dwellings. The annual requirement of houses for people coming of age and marrying each year is about 50,000. The lag is very great and is not being overtaken. It is great because of the war, and the failure of governments to employ people to do anything but pull out weeds from the gutters during the depression. The country is in a tragic position. It may be that the Government will have to do something drastic about big homes and about people who have two or more homes. We cannot have very good people, many of whom are ex-servicemen of the last war, breaking their hearts trying to find homes. Every honourable member is finding that people are saying to him, "" Oan't you help me to get a house ? "" I am continuously being met with, that request in Melbourne. I do my best with the emergency housing authorities and others but the position is getting worse. Something very imaginative will have to be tried. Some new approach will have to be made. The only suggestion that I can make is that the War Service Homes Division prepare plansfor building more homes. If the problem of housing is not solved this country will be subject to a lot of social upsets. There are divorces which have been caused because young people cannot obtain a home in which they may live together. There will be a lot of industrial trouble and social unrest unless we can give to the head of every family something which is his by natural right-the opportunity to obtain suflicient of the wealth of this Development regarding housing activity during 1948-49. They read as follows:Dwellings Commenced.

There are two matters of urgent importance that I wish to raise. A matter that I bring to the attention of the Minister at the table refers to the value of the £1 and the payment of ex-servicemen's gratuities which will amount to a figure somewhere between £40,000,000 and £60,000,000. What does the Government intend to do in regard to gratuity payments ? Does it intend to release this money on an inflated market? On the basic of statistics, is it going to give the soldier only 10s. for every £1 that he earned? The money has already been set aside. Provision for payment was made before this Government took office. The indebtedness was more or less provided for before the Chifley Government was defeated. I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt), who is interested and knowledgeable, to say whether there can be some solution of this grave and serious problem. If the £60,000,000 to be provided will have in effect the value of only £30,000,000, will that be a reasonable thing to do? Would it not be better to consider the plan applied after the 1914-18 war under which bonds were issued which were not to mature until national stability had reasserted itself, and money had the value that it previously had, or had reached a level very",78,Intensified Recruiting Plan In South Australia Canberra April 26 Th E Raising Of South
279,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [11.34],"close to it? The most alarming statistics have been issued and have been cited in this House. They show that in the last quarter the rise in the cost of living has been to an all time high. ""With that flood of inflation in existence, the money for the serviceman, his blood money as it is called, will have to be paid under an' agreement made under an act. It is a serious matter for the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the Cabinet to consider. Following closely on the lines of that matter is the decision that is likely to be made, I believe, in the next few weeks about payments to ex-prisoners of war. They have been variously estimated to total between £3,000,000 and £6,000,000. That means that another heavy current of money is to be released upon a flood of inflation, and will have the same disabilities as far as the real value of the money is concerned. I suggest that the Minister give consideration to means whereby this money may keep its face value for the benefit of the ex-servicemen. It is money that has been hardly earned. I put the matter forward most strenuously and ask for a pronouncement upon it. The second matter that I wish to mention was raised by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon). relates to American films, the flesh-andblood theatres, and the general decay of the ordinary standards of entertainment, and, for lack of a better word, the culture best in the world cannot produce its own of this country. I agree with what the honourable member has said regarding films. There are 8,000,000 people in this country. Most Australians are on a standard of living that is comparable with American standards, yet Australians are the greatest hick buyers of "" B"" class programmes that cannot be sold in America. standard productions of British and American films, and the good British films are of superlative quality, the general level of two-feature programmes sold in Australia is that of what are known in the trade as corny "" B "" class films. generally provided for the people of this country. The flesh and blood theatre is a thing of the past. In the city of Sydney, which has 1,500,000 people, there are three flesh-and-blood theatres, all of llr. Haylen. which are devoted to vaudeville. One straight play is running at present. Recently in Adelaide one theatre was sold for some reason, and despite strenuous efforts by honourable members from South Australia, aided as far as I could aid them through my interest in the National Theatre, nothing could be done to prevent the sale, because of constitutional restrictions on the giving of direct grants to the State. So the position is that very bad films are having a bad effect on the cultural development of this nation, and members of the National Government can do nothing about the establishment of a national theatre. There is nothing wrong with films in general, but there is something drastically wrong with those that youngsters must go to see screened on Saturdays. They are not sold as entertainment for children. They are rough "" B "" class films that are examined casually to ensure that they have no sex but plenty of blood and thunder in them. That is the pabulum that is provided for the children on Saturday afternoons. The counter to it is to establish an Australian national theatre and an Australian national drama, and if the move cannot come from the It National Government, where in the name of Heaven is it to come from? If a nation of 8,000,000 people with standards that are comparable with the drama as it produces its Olympic runners, cricketers, boxers, soldiers, politicians and statesmen, there is something drastically wrong. The wrong lies in the fact that there is a solid wall of indifference between the aspirations of the nation and their realization. That must be broken down by the Government. Whereas there are Some plan must be evolved so that the real aspirations of Australia may be given expression in other than the field of sport. It must appear in the field of drama. A speech of this kind is not popular and is even considered highbrow. Nevertheless I say, most That is the entertainment sincerely, that this is a work of national development that has been delayed for far too long., If one wants to find the true significance of a nation one must examine its culture and drama. If anybody dropped in from America oi Mars he would find nothing to read about this country except what is published in 200 or 300 books. Where is our drama? The answer is that it has been stifled and not allowed to develop. useless to complain about the films we receive. We have given ourselves over commercially to films and cannot therefore complain about their inartistic qualities. Plans were made in regard to the national theatre by the Chifley Government. They did not provide for a very expensive venture. They were little feelers that were put out to the the pion for the national theatre be found in the Government? The honourable member for Curtin( Mr Hasluck), who is interested in this matter, might give some assistance in seeing that somebody shall be gingered up to keep the ball rolling. Here is an example of the tragedy that is developing in this country. A wealthy woman in Sydney, the daughter of a grazier, and the possessor of a considerable personal fortune has been sold out of her theatre in Sydney, the Minerva, where good sound plays were presented. She has had to leave it after losing £66,000. The pioneering women have not entirely disappeared from this country if, in the fields of artistic endeavour, one woman is prepared to sacrifice from £66,000 to £70,000 to keep the flame of drama alight. All credit to Miss Kathleen Robinson. I think that she should be paid a public tribute in this House although I am sorry about the result of her venture. A moving picture show has moved into the Minerva Theatre and that is another indication of how far down Australians have gone culturally. When honourable members have the time and opportunity I ask them to consider these things. 1 also ask that the desirability of establishing a national theatre for Australia be considered in the National Parliament. did not intend to participate in this discussion until I heard the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr rabbit destruction rested with the respecCalwell). If at any time in any quarter a reasonable plea for more attention to housing is raised, I believe that there are many members on this side of the chamber who would wish to support it. I do not wish to develop the theme at any length and shall confine myself to three observations. The first is that it was very pleasing to It is notice the contrast, both in manner and in matter, between the apnroach of the honourable member for Melbourne to the subject and that of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward). The second is that any approach to the problem of housing must necessarily be bold and imaginative. We cannot approach the subject successfully by doing the conventional things in the convenStates. Can some chamtional way. The problem is too big to be dealt with by half measures. The third observation is by way of qualification of what was said by the honourable member for Melbourne. It seems to me that the problem is one not only of construction but also of the supply of materials. Any bold and imaginative scheme must have regard, not only to methods of construction, but also to methods of producing materials. was filled with regret to-night when, after the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) had appealed for an acceleration of the housing programme, he was attacked by the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) and accused of being a political humbug. It is regrettable that the honourable member for Mallee should be so unconscious of the acuteness of the housing situation in the electorate of East Sydney and in other city industrial areas as to engage in personalities of the character that he employed when dealing with the subject. If we hark back to the political record of the honourable member in this House, we must recall that, during the regime of the Chifley Government, he moved the adjournment of this House and wasted its time by indicting the Chifley Government on account of its alleged failure to deal with the menace of rabbit infestation. He did so notwithstanding the fact that he was well aware that responsibility for the enforcement of tive State governments and that the Commonwealth's function was to promote scientific research through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in co-operation with",79,Housing Activity In 1948 And 1949

He knew that the menace could be virtually eliminated if .the State governments shouldered their ^ responsibilities. present Government has failed to expend even Is. by way of contribution to the expenses of the State governments in the extermination of rabbits on private lands and on Crown lands, although its coffers are bulging as the result of the wise financial policy of the Chifley Government and the continued high wool prices and customs revenue. In support of my statement that the extermination of rabbits is a State responsibility, I refer to the fact that the McGirr Labour Government of New South ""Wales recently sat the machinery of the law in operaion and prosecuted no less a personality than the Honourable John Lienhop, a wealthy landholder in Victoria and a former colleague of the honourable member for Mallee. This gentleman owns . 7,000 acres of land in the Riverina area in New South Wales that was absolutely infested with rabbits. So serious was the situation that seven neighbouring landholders came to court in order to give evidence against him. Yet the honourable member for Mallee had the temerity to-night to accuse the honourable member for East Sydney of being a political humbug and previously to indict the Chifley Government for its alleged failure to deal with the rabbit menace. I remind him that, since the present tory Government came to office, he has done nothing but ask a few harmless questions of the Minister for National Development ( Mr Casey), obviously in the knowledge that the answers would be in the same strain as the answers that were given to him by Ministers of the Chifley Government. The Chifley Government accepted its responsibility for prosecuting scientific research through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organthey will pay for them. It should be reization, and it expected the State governmembered that England had a popuments to accept their responsibilities by putting the boots into those neglectful landholders in various parts of Australia who had failed to perform the duties required of them under the various State acts relative to the destruction of vermin. It is time that people who If r . Pollard. accuse others of political humbug examined their own records. The Air and Minister for Civil Aviation) [11.51] -The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) has been doing some heavy electioneering because an election will be held in Victoria a fortnight from next Saturday, but I do not think that his heavy verbal attack upon rabbits will help the Labour party in Victoria. That party will have no more success at the election than it had on a previous occasion. I had not intended to reply at this stage to the matters that have been raised, but just to gag the debate, which appears to be going on indefinitely to gag it? admission. remarks that have been made in this debate require replies. I largely agree with the comments that have been made by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) about the theatre. He has raised this matter constantly. He wants to have a national theatre in Australia, but the solution that he proposed for the problem would not be effective. The legitimate stage is languishing, and many films as well as many gramophone records that are imported, might well be done without. Those honourable members who have heard the ""Eight O'clock Rhythm"" broadcast in the mornings will realize that many dollars might be saved by refusing import licences for such records. Some films come within the same category of undesirability in my view. However, that is a matter of selection by the people. If the people like such records and films, lation less than half the size of Australia's present population when Shakespeare did his great work. If there be a Shakespeare in Australia, he will materialize in due course. Art and music are flourishing in this country, but we have not reached the peak of our literary development.

Generally, I consider that progress is being made, though it may not be so rapid as the honourable member for Parkes may wish. The honourable gentleman also referred to the payment of subsistence allowances to former prisoners of war, a subject that we may thank the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) for keeping alive in this Parliament. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) stated in his policy speech that something would be done on behalf of the former prisoners of war and that a committee would be appointed. His promise will be honoured, and the matter will be adjusted when the committee completes its deliberations. The other subject mentioned by the honourable member for Parkes was that of the war gratuity. He asked whether gratuity payments could be made now. He knows that the Government that he supported undertook an obligation to pay war gratuity on a certain date. Many men are applying now for their gratuity and are getting it. Those who want the gratuity badly and have good supporting reasons, such as the needs of their dependants or their intention to build properties, are being accommodated. Mr ""WHITE -Yes. Many applicants are being paid now. the Minister has stated. applications, and I pass them on to the proper authorities. many men whose applications have been rejected. not prove their claims. However, many applications offer satisfactory evidence in support of their requests, and they are dealt with sympathetically. value of the £1, the fact is that value is fast returning to the £1. Much has been said about housing tonight, and the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) has asked that the War Service Homes Division be made a constructing authority. His speech was like an echo of some of the speeches that we made over the years when we were in Opposition in this House and appealed time after time for something to be done to improve the housing situation. How little was done by the Chifley Government! Pew houses were built by the War Service Homes Division over a period of many years. A l though it is a good organization, it is not a constructing authority. However, it is now producing houses at a faster rate than it ever achieved during the past six or seven years. It contracts with private enterprise for the construction of homes, a policy of which the Labour Government disapproved. The Labour Government in fact succeeded in reducing the rate of construction of war service homes to a very low level. Everybody agrees that the general shortage of houses is acute and is not being rectified as fast as should be possible. A great many prefabricated houses are being imported. We have been told of the sufferings of people in the electorate of East Sydney. Such conditions are common to many parts of Australia. In eight years of office, the Labour Government did not get anywhere near a solution of the problem, but, in a few' short months, we have accelerated the building programme considerably. Amongst those who are suffering most because of the housing shortage are members of the services. Some of our best men are being lost to the services because no provision is made for their families at distant stations. A higher priority is now being given to the construction of houses for members of the forces in remote areas. The Government has removed customs duties from many building materials. It is true that the Labour Administration initiated this action, but we have extended the exemption to a huge range of materials. The greater the production of building materials that can be achieved in this As for the alleged falling country, the more houses will be built. The measure introduced into this chamber earlier to-night will purge the trade unions of the wreckers who are hampering production to-day.

In my reply to the honourable member I promised, to Bupply a full statement on the question and I now furnish the following information:700 600 As the honourable member is aware, Aus1,200 tralia's immigration policy admits 'migrants under three main categories-(o ) British migrants introduced under the free and .. 5,000 assisted passage schemes; (6) displaced per.. 15,000 20,00 0 sons under an agreement with the InterTelecommunications national Refugee Organization; (c) landing permit-holders, i.e. full-fare paying aliens.

The difficulty in regard to the 1,143,000 compulsory X-raying of British migrants is Australia made an original capital that there are not sufficient facilities at present contribution but for this throughout the United Kingdom.

S00 Europe, it is most definitely incorrect to conclude that because of this, abnormal lung conditions have been overlooked by Australian medical officers.

As an added health precaution all displaced persons on arrival in Australia are subjected to a further medical examination and chest X-ray. Where there is any indication of abnormality, and it is possible for this to develop between time of X-ray in Europe and arrival in Australia some months later, the migrant concerned is given Is. it a fact that some any necessary curative treatment which often . only involves rest and suitable care for a short period. The number of cases so treated has been particularly low and is between one and two .persons per thousand.
