5,Mr Casey,"I have seenthereportcomplete and forthright denial to the charge that there has been any underestimating of federal revenue whilst I havo been associated with the Commonwealth Treasury. With regard to remissions of taxation, I would point out that it has been the.policy of this Governif a way oould be found, with critics like Mr ment to make such remissions as are possible in view of the obligations which rest upon it, and of the estimated revenue at the beginning of the financial year. Customs and excise revenue is exceedingly difficult to estimate. The best estimate possible is made of the Government's obligations, and remissions of taxation are based on it. The Government considers it to be an unsound plan to overestimate customs and excise revenue, and to make remissions of direct taxation accordingly. Professor Bland's remarks in respect of trust funds are merely a re-hash of those made earlier by Mr Cerutty. These .latter, I have answered at length in this chamber. The trust funds are in no sense hidden reserves. They aTe not hidden, and they are not .reserves. They are fully accounted for in the financial papers which are presented to this House. They cannot be drawn upon by the Government in case of need. They are for a specific purpose, and until that purpose is accomplished no part of them may be transferred, to general revenue. In conclusion, I consider that I am justified in expressing the hope that in the material which Professor Bland. prepares for his students at the University and thought are given to its preparation. able the Treasurer should only reply to the question. the Minister for Commerce been drawn to certain strictures which were recently passed by the Premier of Queensland, Mr tising, Australia has been able to increase Forgan Smith, in relation to Australia House in London, and to a reply to'them made by Mr A. E. Hyland, the Director of Australian Trade Publicity in London! If so, having recently returned from abroad, has the right honourable gentleman any comment to make upon the letter sent by Mr Hyland to the Dairy Produce Export Control Board, the concluding sentence of which reads as follows :I would like .to see the Board deal sharply, Forgan Smith, who dp not know what they are talking about; who do not seek expert guidance in making their inquiries; who do jiot try to benefit in reaching their conclusions by the experience of those who hare made themselves familiar with local conditions. able member is merely drawing attention to an opinion expressed by some outside person.

I ask the Ministei whether he has any comment to make with respect to these strictures and tha reply to them, and to say whether Mr Hyland is justified in declaring that the Queensland Government contributes nothing, either morally or financially, towards the subject of the criticism! the original strictures of the Premier of Queensland, but my attention has been drawn to the article published in the Primary Producer last week, which contains Mr Hyland's reply to them. All that I have to say with regard to Mr Hyland, who in this case speaks of butter, is that, as the result of his activities in connection with publicity and adverits sales of butter in Great Britain during the last four years from 41,000 tons a year to 109,000 tons a year.

16,Dr. Earle Page,"I have not seendisappeared. In fact, during the whole of the time when I was in London, New Zealand butter was selling at practically the same price as Australian butter. I know that there has been a good deal of criticism of Mr Hyland's methods. He does not believe as strongly as others do in advertising by means of big placards on buses and so forth. His method is to win the goodwill of the grocers of Great Britain. Under his direction, the number of shops which sell Australian produce has increased from 8,000 to 40,000 in the last six years. I know that he is always ready to listen to any suggestions for the improvement of his methods. BeforeI left LondonI asked him specially to get in touch with the Agents-General of the States to enable them, if possible, still further to improve his methods. order. The Standing Orders forbid the asking of questions in such a way as to give information, or to provide a vehicle for comment by the questioner. The common practice, if not tbe Standing Orders, restricts Ministers in their replies to the giving of information, and they should not be allowed to insert comment or argumentative statements. tative statement. I have ruled that it is not in order for an honourable member to offer comment, or to quote the opinions of others when asking a question. However, honourable members sometimes ask a Minister whether he has any statement to make on a particular subject, or whether he has any comment to offer upon a statement they have quoted. Strictly speaking, it is out of order for a Minister to comply with such a request, but they have always been allowed some latitude in giving information bearing on a question of interest to the House. If a Minister wishes to make a statement which contains argument, or is lengthy, the permission of the House should be sought.. Mr E. F. HARRISON -Has the attention of the Postmaster-General been drawn to the frequent delays which occur in the telephone service between Bendigo and Melbourne? If so, what steps are being taken to rectify the trouble? am una,ble to say whether the attention of the Postmaster-General has been drawn to this matter, but I shall bring it before him now that it has been mentioned by the honourable member. I am quite sure that he will take immediate steps to see that the trouble is rectified. i Minister concur in the resolution carried by the Victorian section of the United Australia party in regard to the adoption of universal military training in Australia? If he does not, will he make a statement to the effect that the Government disapproves of compulsory military training, and will he take steps to ensure that the United Australia party does not continue this form of propaganda? mitted to ask a question, I should ask the honourable member whether he is prepared to accept every recommendation of every branch of every union in the Labour movement. The honourable member was not justified in using the word "" compulsory"" in his question. The resolution referred to by the honourable member does not contain that word, and as it does not press for the introduction of compulsory military training, and the Government does not favour it, the Government and the United Australia party seem to be fairly well in line with regard to the matter. t ter received a reply from the British Government to the proposals for a modification of the control clause of the agreement in connection with the Empire flying boat air mail service from London to Sydney?

Are you aware that in the Northern Territory, allegedly the wildest part of Australia, it is the custom, as a matter of convenience, for every citizen to carry the mail, and that the disclosure of the contents of a letter-n o matter under what provocation-is almost justification for shooting, even among blackfellows? of the honourable-member's question, the matter raised is not one for action by the Speaker.

51,Mr Curtin (Fremantle) [3.35],"I( Mr Lyons), in reply to a similar question, gave honourable members the impression that finality had not been reached. On the adjournment last Thursday the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill), in intimating that he intended to visit New Zealand, and would leave on this mission at the end of this week, said that, after careful consideration, the Commonwealth Government had conveyed to the Government of ithe United Kingdom certain suggestions for the modification of the scheme. suggestions for the modification of a plan submitted by the Government do not involve disagreement with the substance of the proposals, and it would appear that, in principle, the Cabinet has agreed to the British Government's plan. believe that the British scheme involves a seven-day bi-weekly with flying boats from London to Sydney, and there is substantial evidence that this Government has been opposed to the use of flying boats in respect of that portion of the service which at present is being operated under the control of Australia. ister, or the Minister for Defence, if the latter proposes to speak instead of the Prime Minister on this matter, to say whether the decision of this Government, that is, to the extent that it has made a decision-and to some extent it has done so, because the Minister for Defence is going to New Zealand on this matter this week-means that the existing Service between Singapore and Brisbane will be replaced by a through flying boat service from London to Sydney. To .that question to-day the Government ought to give a decisive ""Yea"" or ""Nay."" This Parliament has a right to know whether the substantial element of the proposals of the British Government has the support or opposition of the Australian Government. opinion that it is with a view to affording some excuse for the adoption of the flying boat plan that the Minister for Defence has been commissioned to go to ""Wellington to consult with the Government of New Zealand, concerning arrangements for the proposed flying boat service to continue across the Tasman, with its terminal at Wellington or some other New Zealand city. I believe that, if the New Zealand Government can be draggsd into this scheme on this, or some other, basis, the usual propaganda will be put forward by the Commonwealth Government to the"" effect that, in order to . link up New Zealand with the system, it is not practicable to employ land planes on any portion of the route. I remind the Prime Minister that, on the 31st January last, he said that the Commonwealth Government found difficulty in reconciling the Obviously, proposals of the Imperial Government with Australian conditions and local British requirements. That statement was very conclusive, and at that stage the British proposal obviously was unsatisfactory in principle to the Australian Government. Parliament has the right to know whether 1 the Commonwealth Government has altered its view or whether the British air service Government has so varied its proposals as to make acceptable now a plan that early this year was irreconcilable with Australian conditions. One of the two Governments must have revolutionized its ideas during the year as to what was regarded as necessary for Australia in connection with the scheme of imperial I challenge the Prime Minair mail services. The statement of the Prime Minister was reiterated a few days afterwards by the Minister for Defence, who said that the Commonwealth Government had decided that it could not accept the proposals outlined in the Empire air mail scheme. We are warranted, however, in construing the present situation as indicating a change of policy on the part of the Commonwealth Government for reasons that I shall indicate. Quite recently the Attorney-General( Mr Menzies) and the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) have returned from a visit to London, and have had the opportunity to impart to their colleagues views which I venture to say are in absolute contraI venture the distinction to those furnished previously by the Minister for Defence, and which are not supported by the officers of either the Civil Aviation Department or the Defence Department. I say that because in the explanation of the defence policy of the Government, which the Minister for Defence gave honourable members only a few days ago in the course of a carefully prepared speech, he intimated in the clearest language, that at the recent meeting of the Council for Defence, recommendations to revise the Salmond scheme of air defence against, raids included(Â£>) The substitution of land planes for flying boats iu four coast reconnaissance units. Having regard to the great importance of this subject it is imperativethat before the Minister for Defence leaves Australia for New Zealand next Saturday this Parliament should decide whether or not the use of flying-boats is preferable to that of land aeroplanes between Darwin and Sydney. I understand that the British Government's plan means that a British company will be the responsible contractor for operations over the route not only from London to Singapore, but also from Singapore to Darwin and from Darwin to Sydney, pooling the fleets and the personnel of its Indian and subsidiary companies with its own resources. If that be the case-and the Government has not given us enough information to permit us to know just what the position is-it would appear clear that Australia's control over vital internal air mail services will be jeopardized if not destroyed by its adoption of the scheme. way? are an integral feature of the general development of the Commonwealth and our national control of them is, I submit, of vital importance and is indispensable to the proper development of Australian aviation generally. external arrangements affect our development? the company in Australia would not be subject to control by the Commonwealth Government, but would be dictated very largely by the arrangements which the company was able to make with the Imperial Government. The Commonwealth Government would have hardly any control, because, whenever the company wanted to do a certain thing; it would justify itself by a reference to its relations to the Imperial service, rather than the Commonwealth. orable gentleman speaking of external services'{ internal service between Darwin and Sydney. Apart from the considerations which I have just outlined, which involve the general principle, there is grave reason for disquietude regarding ths suitability of flying-boats for Australian conditions. Mr Harold Gatty delivered an address while he was in Australia two months ago in which he said that flying boats did not fit in with the scheme of defence in Australia. Major Brearley,. who has had as long experience of aerial services in Australia as any other executive, and is most competent, to give 'a fair judgment on the subject, has saidControl of tbe Singapore-Brisbane section must be retained by Australia, and must continue to be operated by Australians. I refer honourable members, also, to the following remarks by Major BrearleyA t 'present, this service is one of tha cheapest and most efficient in the world. It is' regular, and always on time, and latterly our planes, owing to repeated delays in the service from theLondon end, have been flying beyond Singapore to Bangkok to pick up the. mails. A land-plane service between Singapore and Brisbane, supported by efficient ground organization, is of vita] importance to Australia, because of the experience it gives our airmen of our internal routes. In time of war, theso routes are of tremendous strategical importance, as they aro the vulnerable points in our defence. I feel warranted in saying that the flying-boat plan is an integral part of the agreement which the British Government has apparently insisted upon, and refused to modify. Apparently, the CommonAvealth Government has withdrawn, itsopposition. If so, Australian aviation development will be greatly retarded in the next fifteen years, and our airmen will not have the advantage of the experience which would have been theirs had the original policy of which the Minister for Defence informed us early this year been strictly adhered to by. the Government. The general consensus of authoritarian opinion is that it will be impracticable to prepare the route between Darwin and Sydney for flying boats of the type which it is understood the British Government contemplates using. * I am forced to the conviction",16,England Australia Airmai L Service Formal Motion Fob Adjournment

57,Mr Curtin,"I am speaking of thethat the Commonwealth Government is unjustifiably yielding to British pressure, and is being forced to a decision which threatens the reliability of our own aerial British Government in regard to the overservices. Notwithstanding the repeated assurances that the Government had rejected the proposal for a flying-boat service on the Australian section of the route, it now appears almost settled that it has allowed its opinion of the undesiraNew Zealand and in fact which I have bility of this type of craft to be overborne. I shall be content if the Minister for tralia and New Zealand. 'The circumDefence, in the course of his reply, will say definitely that flying boats will not be used on the Australian section of this air mail service. If he makes such a statement, definitely and emphatically, we shall know where we are. I submit to the honourable gentleman that the Government should retain complete control of the whole of our inland air mail serviee, and, in particular, that part of it operating between Singapore and Sydney. I put it to him that the Imperial Air Mail Service, by and large, will be regarded by the Imperial authorities, not so much from the point of view of Australia,, as from its own point of view; our requirements will be subordinated to the Imperial requirements, and even our defence requirements may be overlooked. In. considering the defence of the Pacific, and of our own country, the Government should not be guided by the opinions of British Ministers, who do nor. know our circumstances and outlook; nor should it be influenced unduly by its members who have recently been on a short visit to England. Full weight should be given,, to the views of the officers of the Defence Department and the Civil Aviation Department. Can the Minister for Defence tell ns section of the route. that there is justification in the advice he has obtained from his officers for the Government's apparent change of views considerable time, and is one of and its decision to scrap the land-plane very far-reaching importance both service in Australia, and adopt the flyingto Great Britain and to Australia in boat service advised by the British respect to the carriage of mails, and Government ?

The full proposal of the sea air-mail scheme is for the establishment, of a service from Great Britain to Darwin, extending thence to Sydney, and finally to New Zealand. The chief matter which I propose to discuss on my visit to been invited to discuss, is the arrangement concerning the section between Ausstances arose in the following way: A representative of the British Aviation Department is visiting New Zealand to discuss with the government of that dominion matters affecting the New Zealand end of the air-mail proposal, and, in view of the fact that we were concerned with the Australian end of tlte service, the Government of New Zealand invited a member of the Commonwealth Government to be present at those discussions. I emphasize that the Commonwealth representative ha? not been invited by the Government of New Zealand to discuss details of the whole route, nor the proposals for the service between Great Britain and Australia, although there may be an interchange of views on these matters. As a matter of fact, the Postmaster-General of New Zealand was present at a conference which took place here on this subject some time ago, but although he heard the discussions respecting the service f rr.in Great Britain to Australia, he took, no part in them. He participated only iu the ""discussions which affected the New Zealand end of the service. The object of my visit to New Zealand, at tbe invitation of the government of that dominion, is to discuss the New Zealand-Australia The proposal itself dates back a aviation generally. For that reason, and it is not a proposal which can be accepted ject of the fullest investigations. It may",18,England Australia Airmai L Service Formal Motion Fob Adjournment
58,"Sir Archdale Parkhill (Waroffhand, Without Being Made The Sub","that negotiations in this connection have been somewhat protracted. 1 am prepared to admit that, but the fault cannot be attributed entirely to the Commonwealth scheme, was first proposed, a conference took place in Sydney which was attended by representatives of the Post Office and the Civil Aviation Department of Great Britain, and the Commonwealth then asked for further details in regard to important aspects of the proposal. Those important aspects involved such considerations as control, in its effect on Australian aviation and defence, the cost, and the nature of the services to be carried out-whether be operated by flying boats or by large land planes. Some months elapsed before this additional information came to hand, and then, in view of the fact that the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) and the Attorney-General( Mr Menzies) were shortly to be in London, I submitted to this House that it was reasonable that the Commonwealth Government should request those Ministers to ascertain by personal conversations with the Air Ministry in Great Britain the nature and full import of those further details, and other information generally which the Commonwealth Government required on the matter. obtained the information, and, in reply to the criticism by the Leader of the Opposition, I state that it is in no sense in conflict with the views held by the Commonwealth Government on this subject. It deals with other aspects of the matter entirely, and I emphasize that it in no way conflicts with the opinions expressed by the Civil Aviation Department or the Defence Department. I suggest, with great respect, that the Leader of the Opposition is confusing two very distinct matters; first, the external service to Australia; and secondly, the internal services. The proposal with which I am concerned at the present time involves the external service from Great Britain to Australia. To-day the mails between the two countries are carried under contract by the Orient Line and, to some extent, by the Peninsular and Oriental Line of steamers. It is now proposed to substitute for the carriage of mails by steamcontrol of them in any sense, shape or ship, a bi-weekly air service, and the Bir Archdale Parkhill. scheme, as at present put forward, includes the use of large flying boats for this purpose.

According to the proposal, the terminus for the flying boats Avill be at Sydney, and thence to New Zealand. has given me complete justification for my criticism. not really know the point of the the route should criticism of the Leader of the Opposition, because it has been all "" over the place,"" and I submit, with very great respect to the honourable gentleman, that it has not been in accordance with the facts. I have no desire to mislead the House. The proposal, which is clear and defined, is to bring by air all first-class mail to Darwin, thence to Sydney and finally to New Zealand. At the moment, the Commonwealth Government is concerned with the proposal for the transport of these mails from Great Britain to Darwin and thence to Sydney. That is one aspect of the matter, but the internal services are an entirely different Those Ministers have consideration which are not wholly bound up at all with this proposal. Darwin to Sydney is an internal one? is a matter of definition. I do not regard a service by flying boats which follow a route around the coast of Australia from Darwin to Sydney as being part of our internal aviation system. To make the position quite clear, I point out that there has never been any suggestion of control with regard to our internal services, by which I mean services which are internal, which are within the coastline of Australia. The object of the Government envisages the continued extension of these aviation services in the interests of the public of Australia and of aviation generally, and nothing is contained in the proposals for an air mail service between Great Britain and Australia, which would interfere with that objective or affect the form.",19,England Australia Airmai L Service Formal Motion Fob Adjournment

I opposed certain aspects of the scheme, ancl 1 am still opposed to some of them; but I am exercising my right as a member of tbe Commonwealth Government to put forward those views in the proper place. At present a further proposal is adumbrated for a night flying service between the capital cities of the Commonwealth for tlie carriage of first class mail matter, and 'this, in itself, would again increase the activities of internal aviation.

The very great advantage of such an interchange of views to both governments, and certainly to the Government of Australia, must be obvious to every one.

101,Sir Archdale Parkhill,"I doia, that the Government has never deviated from its desire to maintain the right of Australia to settle these matters for itself. [Leave to continue given]. The Government has always kept in mind, -and is keeping in mind now, the necessity -to maintain full control over Australian aviation, especially in its relation to defence. The extension of aviation, particularly in .relation to defence, is of the has talked all around the subject. He has -utmost importance to the people of this country. It is hardly necessary to say that the Government is determined that the views of Australia on this important matter will be definite and clear, and that everything before a dofinite agreement is it will contend for them to the fullest extent. I would only add in conclusion that I personally regret my inability to give fuller information, in view of the negotiation's which are now proceeding. Every Other Minister is in the same position. I believe I speak for the Prime Minister when I say, however, that as soon as the negotiations reach finality a full statement will be made by him to this House. While the negotiations are proceeding it is not reasonable to seek to obtain piecemeal statements that may have to be altered oh account of the nature of subsequent proceedings. consider that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has done valuable service in .having brought forward this matter for the consideration of honourable members. W,e know that other agreements have been entered into by the Government behind the back of Parliament, and that Parliament has been .asked to endorse them holus bolus; it has been told that no amendment of them could be accepted. Obviously, the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) was .distinctly uncomfortable. Evidently a good deal of pressure is being applied to him on behalf of overseas authorities, with a view to weakening the Australian attitude which he adopted when this matter was brought forward six or eight months ago. Are we to assume that the flight which the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) made to Australia in a flying boat has caused the Minister for Defence to weaken? We know that the Minister for Commerce was given a right royal time. Did the Commonwealth Government pay for that flight, or was it provided gratis by Imperial Airways? Is it having repercussions in the Federal Cabinet to-day? The Minister for Defence has not definitely told us that the Sydney to Singapore link of the Imperial Air Mail service will be controlled by Australia and manned by Australians. The honourable gentleman said that there are many things which he would like to tell us, but that he is not in a position to do so. As representatives of the people, we have the right to know signed and sealed. When that stage is reached, it will be too late to take action. We now have the opportunity to make a protest on behalf of Australia, and particularly iu the interests of aviation in this country. Major Brearley can be regarded as an authority on this subject. He pioneered commercial aviation in Australia, and he is spokesman for sixteen companies which are apprehensive that the interests of Australian aviation will be sacrificed. He has stated that control of the Brisbane-Singapore section of the route must be retained by Australia, and that the service must be operated by Australians. Is it too much to ask the Government to state definitely that control of the service from Singapore to Sydney will be kept by Australia, and that the service will be manned by Australians ? honourable member will find, when everything has been"" arranged, that control of this section has been retained. now that the Government will be adamant on that point ? Our fear ""is that the Government will weaken, as it weakened in regard to the trade diversions scheme, and in regard to other important matters of policy. We know what the Minister for Defence would like to see done, but we have grave fears that he may be overruled as the result of the visit abroad of the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) and the Attorney General( Mr Menzies), who were feted and made much of in Great Britain.

Aviation can be made popular only if high standards of safety and efficiency are maintained, and all aerodromes and machines are regularly inspected to see that they comply with requirements. It is proposed that mails carried by the flying boats shall be subject to only ordinary postage rates. 13 it intended that the same shall apply to all Australian airmail services? If so, the Postal Department will incur a very substantial loss. Major Brearley has stated that he is gravely suspicious of the efficiency and suitability of the new Imperial Airways flying boats, which it is proposed to put en the Australian service. He says that the construction of these boats is being rushed, and that they will be too low in the water to be safe in case of rough weather. The American flying boats, on the other hand, stand high, out of the water, and are much more suitable for all-weather Imperial Airways has not been wholly satisfactory, and there have been many accidents attended by fatalities. The -peed of the planes at present on the service is 130 miles an hour, and it is proposed that the new flying boats will operate at 150 miles an hour, whereas the Dutch planes, already operating along the same route, fly at ISO miles an hour. The present scheduled time for the service between London and Singapore is eight days, but the Dutch planes oover the same distance in five days. Imperial Airways have not, up to the present, been able to operate their section of the route as efficiently as we have operated curs. During the last twelve months, the mails from London to Singapore have been late on 25 occasions, while on only two occasions have they boen late from Singapore to Australia.

Up to the present, this anticipation has been indulged in mostly by the press; but it has now spread to Parliament. Every point raised by the Opposition, as well as a great many others, has already been discussed by the Commonwealth Government with the Government of Great Britain. The Opposition's criticism is confined to two main points. According flying. The record of to the motion, the Government has accepted an undisclosed agreement, and this acceptance will interfere with the national control of local services. The Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) has given an emphatic denial in regard to both those charges, but the general effect of the criticism by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), is that the Government has been unmindful of the interests of Australia. If anything bo needed to show that that suggestion is totally unwarranted, it is only necessary to recall the protracted nature of the Government's discussion on this matter with the British Government, which indicates the Commonwealth Government's unwillingness to give way on any point of the slightest importance to Australia. All that has been discussed up to the present time is the question of improving the service to the greatest possible extent in the interests of Australia, because surely there is nobody who does not believe that there is room for imAn aviation provement in the connection between Australia and the outside world.

It is evident, as has been shown throughout the whole of the negotiations, that the Government has fought to secure a continuous improvement of the internal services as a result of the agreement, its chief desire being that the local control of that part of the service which Australia an opportunity to express its satisfaction has pioneered from Singapore southward should still be in Australian hands, and be one of the means by which civil aviation is encouraged in the Commonwealth. We have fought for the right to impose a surcharge on. the air mails sent from Australia.. Why did we do that? Because, by that means, we should be able to obtain, a certain additional amount of revenue which would enable us to improve our internal services. That is the direction in which we are using the money now' being obtained by reason of the internal surcharge. There is no question as to whether we shall maintain OUT internal air lines.

There is no other way of dealing with this particular matter. The Parliament has the right to decide the fate of a government which acts in a. manner incompatible with national interests'; but this Government has never shown the slightest intention to do anything derogatory to those interests.

If the Government has been concerned about the protection of Australia's interests, it is remarkable that a good deal of difference of opinion has arisen among Ministers themselves as to the attitude which the Government should adopt. Whilst the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) has been outspoken in his determination to safeguard the interests of Australia, it seems that other boats as a reason for the maintenance of members of the Cabinet, in his opinion, are not following the course which should be taken with regard to the service. The object of the Opposition is to ascertain precisely what the Government intends to do on the important matters of principle that are involved. asked to be furnished with details of the negotiations, nor do we expect to be supplied with them. We appreciate the fact that the negotiations are of a delicate nature, but certain principles are at stake, and their maintenance is vitally .necessary in the interests of this country. far as Wellington is concerned. The .first important principle for which the Opposition stands is that the Australian section of the service should remain under Australian control. The Minister for Oommerce said that the Government had been fighting for that principle, yet there is no assurance that the Government will stand hard and fast for it. the British Government had never suggested that the Commonwealth should not retain control of this end of the service. ment decided to stand hard .and fast for Australian control of it absolutely?

When the Minister spoke of this service from Darwin to Sydney and Auckland, and said that he was going to New Zealand to discuss the matter, members of the Opposition had the right to draw the deduction that the Government intended to allow the flying boats to make Sydney their terminal point, and had in mind the crossing of the Tasman Sea by flying a flying boat service from Darwin to Sydney. Has the Government come to a definite decision regarding this aspect of tlie matter? No answer comes from the ministerial bench, but that is the veryquestion to which the public want3 .an We have not answer. Is Darwin or Sydney to be the terminal point? There is still no answer. The people must now conclude that Darwin will not be -the terminal point, that the Government has agreed to make Sydney the terminus, and that the Minister for Defence is going to New Zealand to discuss the final stages, as in fact, has been decided in regard to that.

In my opinion, we have not obtained a clear explanation of the Government's intentions, but we may be able to obtain further information if we persist in seeking it. The Government declares that the development of the internal services is of vital importance. The only way to develop them, according to tbe Minister for Commerce, is to have a flying boat service which will increase the number of tourists to Australia. more important consideration was the surcharge. ment was the weakest I have yet heard him put up. He said that the service would attract tourists who, as the result of their experience of flying boats on the overseas portion of the service would be inclined to use the internal portion, and by that process the internal service would secure full patronage. I am prepared, however, to overlook that very weak argument. Every honourable member will agree that mail services offer a greater fillip to our internal air services than anything else can provide at the present time; it was on the basis of mail services that our internal services were pioneered. A mail service guarantees continuous service independent of the patronage of passengers. Therefore, any change which would tend to weaken this incentive must necessarily weaken the services themselves. them. services of what I , with every one else, the mail subsidy, the services which play a vital part in the maintenance and development of our air routes will be maimed. This House is not completely satisfied to continue these services ""as they operate to-day, because if we accept them as the best that can be obtained we admit that we have reached an the peak in regard to this matter and are prepared to let them develop only to that extent which would result from the patronage of ordinary passengers. ber has exhausted his time. Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) said that the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) was quite emphatic in his reply on this subject, but I confess that I thought he was less emphatic than he usually is. To me he appeared to be on the defensive. I do not blame him altogether in this regard, because in dealing with matters which are subjects of negotiations with another government thia Government cannot state the position from day to day, or report on each step to this House. We must rely upon the Government to use its discretion in such a way as will enable it to arrive at the best arrangement possible. One point on which the reply of the Minister for Defence was not completely satisfactory was whether or not this contract was going to be handed over entirely to the Imperial Airways or any company other than an Australian company. I do not think that this serviee should be handed over to any company. In fact, the control of it and the profits to be made out of it, should be kept strictly under the sway of the Government of the day. The people of Australia, as a whole, are very much concerned about the development of aviation in this country, and they look to civil aviation to supply the means of development. From that point of view it is desirable that we should maintain the trans-Australian route from Darwin, although Australia's decision on this matter, I take it, is properly one for experts. I -believe that every honourable member will agree that Australians should be employed on the Australian section of the England-Australia service.

I feel sune that this Government has the interests of Australia at heart in this matter, and, feeling that it will do the right thing, I suggest that this House should not request it to detail the present negotiations, but should be prepared to accept the settlement which it will eventually place before honourable members. sure that all honourable members who listened to the speech made by the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) was just as wise when the Minister coneluded as they were when he started. I believe that, if the Minister were free to speak his mind on this issue, honourable members would be given the fullest information. A few days ago, in his lastminute appeal on this matter to the Cabinet, he saidIf Australia accepted the British scheme Britisli Government, and despite this she would virtually exclude herself from a fact, the Minister says that no plan has share in international aviation control. Sir obvious that a statement made at a Cabito any decision in consultation with tbe net meeting would not be published in Government of New Zealand.

I am uot an expert on such matters, they were feasted and banqueted, are now but more concerned about British than Australian interests in this matter. As. the use of flying boats on a service of British interests have found it so easy this nature, and American"" aviation to convert the Attorney-General to their authorities adopt a similar attitude. way of thinking,they now say he is the man to represent Australia at the coronation. To-day he has allied himself with the Minister for .Commerce in trying to persuade the Cabinet to twist on the declarations made publicly by tbe Minister for Defence on this matter. In passing, it is worth noting that Lord Sempill, who is closely associated with aviation, proposes to visit Australia shortly. If British interests are satisfied in this matter, I have no doubt that the ouly interest this Government will I would not agree to have iu the England-Australia air service will be as the payer of a subsidy for that service; it will have no effective control whatever; the control of the service, including ships and pilots, will be centred iu England. The Minister for Defence has stated that, from a defence view-point, Australia must, as a Pacific power, develop its aviation to the fullest extent. He recognizes the danger confronting this country should we submit to the proposal now being forced down the throats of members of this Government.. Civil and defence aviation experts are unanimously opposed to the British Government's plan. The Minister for Defence has said so.

I contend that if the mail subsidy is withdrawn the internal service will be ruined., It is clear, therefore, that littorals for such a service,, affording as if any alteration of the present control of the internal service is made, it will be made merely to satisfy the greed of British interests.' I am not using this, argumenrt. against the Minister for Defence; I believe that honourable members generally support him in the stand he has. taken on this matter. little. being brought to bear on him. I knov* that before they journeyed overseas both the Minister for Commerce and the Attorney-General supported the view of the Minister for Defence. Since their return from overseas, however, they have supported British interests in the fight now being waged in the Cabinet. The Minister for Defence has toldus that under the British plan a British company would be the responsible contractor in respect of the service on the whole route from London to Sydney, and that it would use the personnel and equipment of its Indian and subordinate services. What then is left for the people of"" this country? Apparently they will have to provide the subsidy, but will have no right of control. The Minister fer Defence was obviously in difficulty in replying to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (J Mr Gurtin), for he did not know what to say. Under existing conditions, I cannot see that any good purpose will be served by the honourable gentleman discussing this subject with the representatives of the Government of New Zealand, and I appeal to honourable members opposite to support the motion asan intima tion to our Government that it should provide U3 with fuller information than it has so far submitted to us. [5.2] I welcome the opportunity to discuss this subject. I think that the Government should be informed of the views of private members upon it. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin)' did not make any contribution towards the solution of the major problems as to whether land planes or flying boats should be usedin the overseas service. The obvious thing, I suggest, is that we should use our. northern and eastern tliey do. a wonderful natural runwayright to Sydney. Tbe Leader of the Opposition should have applauded, rather than chided, the Minister forDefence( SirArchdale Parkliill )1 foT his decision to visit ""New Zealand' to discuss this subject with the dominion authorities.

Surely we do not desire the people of Great Britain to regard us as the "" mugs"" of the South Pacific. It would be ridiculous, if we did not use the Timor Sea,, the Arafura Sea, and the waters of the Western Pacific as theroute for this imperial airmail service. It is highlydesirable that every effort should be made to link together the various countriesof the British Empire which such a service could serve. We should be able to advise Great Britainon such a. matter as this, but, apparently, all. that some honourable, members wish to do is to criticize. They forget that British finance will be an important factor in the service. At the same time we should' take care not to sell our birth right. Personally,. I wish to see Australia in a position to exercise a fair measure of control of the service. On that point, the Leader of the Opposition was on firm ground.

143,Mr Blain (Northern Territory),"that such a service requires unified control,, but Australia should be invited to co-operate in such a way as to make its co-operation more than a mere gesture. This country should articulate its views, not only on memorable occasions, but also as to the general management of the service, l t must also see that its young airmen are given the opportunity to become pilots of the service, and that that famous pioneer aviation company, Qantas, shall not be thrown on to the scrapheap. In my view the establishment of the imperial air-mail service will enable the Qantas machines to. be relieved of a great deal of the heavy loading which they are at present, called upon to accept. The Qantas service is being subjected to undue strain, and on many occasions so many passengers from overseas are on board that I find it difficult to get a seat when I wish to travel from Darwin to the south. If the Qantas machines could be relieved of much of the heavy loading, now offering, a better service could be given to the people in the interior. This refers toQueensland, as well as the Northern Territory. Under such conditions, the Qantas machines would be a hie to make a much more effective contribution to the real development of the interior than isat present possible. serviceto>primary producers in different Actually, nothing very effective is being done in developmental work in the interior to-day in consequence of the establishment of the aviation service, for all the facilities which the planes provide are being strained to meet the exigencies of through traffic. I disagree entirely with the opinions expressed' by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) on the subject of speed. I am not concerned about whether the people of Sydney, and of the south generally, are able to obtain their mails from England and fashion plates from Paris a day or two earlier by means of the new air-mail service than they get them to-day. It is not the welfare of the people living on the -Sydney side of the Great Dividing Rangethat should be considered principally, but that of tbe people of north and central Australia. If as I have suggested, the Qantas machines were relieved of the heavy loading tbey could be used to encourage real development. Hitherto, their contribution to effective development has been trifling for the inherent value of the soil over which the machines fly is very little greater to-day than when the service was instituted. If the mail matter and heavy loading generally be carried by the Imperial air-mail machines* around the coast to Sydney it will mean that a circular route will be developed. So far, Australia has been without an adequate circular service except that provided by the machines which circumnavigate the continent and stop at various ports. Effective circular air routes should be developed. In conclusion, I remind, honourable members that the weight-carrying; capacity of seaplanesis practically only limited by economic conditions, whereas that Â©f. land' planes is definitely restricted^. Seaplanes at present carry from 17 to 20 tons of loading, and I have no doubt that, their capacity will S""bon be lifted to 50. tons, and that it will rise, in OUT time, to as much as 200 tons. This means that we may look forward to the day when seaplanes will be available to l if t produce from one place to another. Only economic circumstances will limit the utilitarianvalueof flying boats. If we have the work available for them, craft of this kind will be able to render remarkableparts, of the Commonwealth. In the cir^ cumstances, I am glad that the Minister for Defence intends to visit New Zealand to discuss the conditions of the service with representatives of the Government of that dominion. I sincerely hope that we shall make good use of the natural runway which our coast provides: I am definitely of the opinion that the development of the Imperial air-mail service by the use. of these routes will render possible the performance of much more useful service by Qantas machines for the people of the interior. Itr. EISKEN (Ballarat) [5.10] I welcome the opportunity that thisdebate givesprivate members to voice their views on some salient aspects of the proposed Imperial air-mail scheme. I appreciate the difficulties that the Min1 ister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkbill) had in-dealing with this subject, for it is more or less public knowledgethat, divergent views are held on it within the Cabinet; but I regret that for this and other reasons it was impossible for the. honourable gentleman to furnish us with more information. The Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) very skilfully told us absolutely nothing. Ono aspect of the^subject which has caused me a good deal of concern has relation to the measure of control which Australia is to exercise. The Minister for Commerce told us in one breath that it had not been pioneered its air routes. In view of proposed that the control should be in any other than Australian hands, but in his next breath he said that the Government was pressing strongly for an adequate power of control. Those two statements do not tally. I should like a much more definite statement from the Minister on this point than we have so far orable members have witnessed the bad. I do not think that any honourable member would accuse me of being unBritish. I claim to be as strongly imperialistic as any honourable member of the Parliament, but ! shall need a great 3 deal of ' persuasion before I cast my vote for any agreement on this subject which will take the control of the Australian section of this service away from Australia. Many other honourable members on this side of the chamber are in a similar position. As to the relative merits ence to Australian aviation enterprises, of flying boats and land planes, I think very few of us are capable of offering a useful opinion. Considerations of empire defence enter largely into the subject, and ing of tenders for the transport of mails the necessity to establish seaplane bases around the Australian coast may make it desirable to use seaplanes rather than land planes for this service. One thing I stress is that whatever the nature of the matter, and from the general terms of service may be it should be conducted under Australian control and manned by Australians. strongly support the views expressed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr routes for Australiau aviation comCurtin). Every right thinking Australian must agree that Australia should control the section of the service from Singapore right to Sydney, and possibly to New Zealand. We should bear in mind that Australians pioneered this service. No aviation enterprises are more justly entitled to derive benefits from the control of air-mail services within Australia than Australian companies. It is deplorable that successive Commonwealth governments have never given Australian aviators the fore found itself unable to agree to these same opportunities as other countries proposals, and has decided to retain the have ofiered to their great airmen. I regret to say that many distinguished Australian aviators have lost their lives in attempting hazardous feats because the Commonwealth Government has not made provision for them, similar to that which has been granted by the TJnited States of America to the aviators who this lack of support from the Commonwealth Government, Australian aviators have been obliged to go barn-storming from country district to country district in order to earn a living, and they have been compelled to take extraordinary chances in pioneering air routes. Hondeplorable spectacle of this Parliament passing motions of condolence upon the death of many of its foremost aviators, for whom positions were not found in Australia. Just prior to his .departure for Great Britain, I received a letter from the late Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, in which he expressed grave concern at the prospect of Imperial Air-' ways obtaining the contract in preferand he hoped that the company in which he was interested would receive some consideration in connection with the grantbetween Australia and New Zealand. I believe that the same gentleman communicated with the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) in regard to that Sir Charles's letter, I assume that the Minister stated in reply that he was sympathetic towards Sir Charles's views. Since then, the Minister has demonstrated his desire to retain Australian air panies. In an official bulletin which was issued recently, the Government stated definitely that it was not in accord with the proposals made by the Imperial Government for taking over the control of the Australian section of the oversea air mail route. I hope that the Government will not permit the Imperial authorities to dictate to it as to how our interests will best be served. The bulletin statedThe Commonwealth Government has there-",30,Archdale Pakkhill Th E Go Claim To Be Their Very Backbone Namely

That statement definitely indicates that Although that was the opinion of the the Commonwealth Government is Oommonwealth Government, it appears opposed to any change, but I should like to me that it now desires to alter to know how it has come about that presits view. The Minister for Defence sure has apparently been brought to bear praised upon it. The Commonwealth Government alone should be responsible for the his sympathies are with it. Before any control of the conveyance of mail matter contract is signed to give the control of within Australia, and it should not have the Australian section of the overseas airto yield to any demands for that control it should be submitted to, and receive which might be made by the Imperial the sanction of,^ this Parliament.

In those discussions, I of them paying the extreme penalty in urge the Minister to stand by his guns doing so. My contentions are equally and not to retreat from the views which applicable to the Tasman sea section he communicated to his constituents at of the route. The Imperial authoriMosmau, and which were reported in the ties seem to be under the impresSydney Morning Herald.

I have read that the ultimate objective of the British Government is to extend this airmail route to New Zealand, Canada, and back to England, thus-establishing a service which will encircle the Empire. So far as we have been able to : gather, England is irrevocably committed to flying boats. I point out that PanAmerican Airways, which is the leading American aviation company, is now inaugurating a world-wide route expansion, and for this purpose is using flying boats. vernment might be prepared to subsidize Both Germany and France operate regular services with such machines across the South Atlantic. Naturally, they would employ flying boats for such a purpose; one does not require to be an expert to realize that the interests of safety -are better served in the operation of a transgranted the contract. Since that date the Atlantic service by flying boats than by ordinary land planes. Italy is another country which uses flying boats upon certain routes. I am not so greatly concerned as to whether flying boats or land planes are used in the Anglo-Australian service. As the Minister for Defence has stated, experts alone can decide that matter. honourable members to decide. claim to be an expert on this subject, and I have no doubt that the respective governments will be guided by the advice of their experts. I appreciate the assurance that the Minister for Defence gave to the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis), in reply to a question, that if the service from Darwin to Sydney is carried on by flying boats, the internal services throughout Australia will in no way be affected. I am sure that honourable members must have shared my gratification upon hearing that -assurance. The Minister for Commerce (Dr -arranged between Great Britain and AusEarle Page) -went even further than tbe Minister for Defence in saying that those services would be increased; and such a statement must have been most pleasing to honourable members, because Australian aviation companies deserve every encouragement. In this connection I refer I particularly to Qantas Limited, the great pioneer of commercial services, not only in Australia, but also throughout the world. I have a most vivid recollection of introducing two young aviators who had completed their term on active service with the air force to the then Prime Minister, Mr Hughes, and the then Minister for Defence, Sir George Pearce, in Melbourne in 1922. At that meeting the pilots put forward a proposal to inaugurate a service in western Queensland, the route to be over a short distance from Longreach to Cloncurry. They were told to proceed with their plan, and that if at the end of twelve months their service had been successful the Goit. So excellently did they operate the route that, at the conclusion of the prescribed time, the Government called for tenders and the Qantas company which they formed was fortunate enough to be company has carried on an evergrowing . service and has established a record that is both admired and appreciated throughout the world. The part played by this original company, as a member of Qantas-Empire Airways Limited in the operation of a service which has been -carried on for two years between Singapore and Brisbane is a splendid example to commercial aviation in any part of the world. One of the young pilots I introduced to Mr Hughes and Sir George Pearce in 19.22 was Mr Hudson Fysh. He is now managing director -of Qantas-Empire Airways Limited, and an international figure in commercial aviation. If this Parliament were to take any action whicli would .affect the progress of this Australian company and others, it would be an abso^te tragedy. No one can fail to -appreciate the value, quite 'apart from the airmail services, of civil aviation to Australia. I fail to see, in this great Empine service which will be tralia, why the Commonwealth should not -be given the control of the Darwin to Sydney section, or perhaps the Sydney to Singapore section. The Australia to New Zealand and the New Zealand to Canada sections are quite another matter, but in view of the marvellous record of eivil",33,Archdale Pakkhill Th E Go Claim To Be Their Very Backbone Namely

147,Sir Donald Cameron,"I do notaviation in Australia it is justified in its open up the back country to an extent claim that the Government should take no action which might affect its ability to carry on and extend its operations. If we were assured on those two points, I believe that every honourable member would be quite satisfied that the Government would make the best agreement possible for Australia. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [5.31] I approach the consideration of this matter from the view-point of the effect which this agreement may have upon the defence and the development of Australia. I am not concerned with the aspect of either speed or cheapness. Those factors, I contend, must be made subsidiary to the defence and the development of Australia. I , suggest that, as sacrifices are being made by taxpayers generally, the commercial world must be prepared to make sacrifices in the interests of the defence of Australia. Let us examine the likely effect in that direction. We know that a scheme of Empire defence may be wrapped up in these proposals. Should the Empire be involved in war, however, the danger to Australia would lie iu the raids which most likely would be made along its coast. I do not believe that a seaplane service, or a service embracing the whole of the Empire, would be of benefit to Australia from the view-point of its defence. crisis, means for defence must exist within Australia itself. Therefore, the question is, whether the best results would accrue from seaplanes or from land planes. I suggest that land planes are necessary to Australia's defence. In case of raids, obviously seaplane bases would be of little use, because they would quickly be put out of action by seacraft. Consequently, bases must be established inland, and that presupposes the use of land planes. The discontinuance of the overland service from Darwin to Sydney would destroy the incentive which is necessary to the development of a solid, landplane defence force. The second point that I wish to make is in relation to Australia's development. [5.38]-by leave I moveThe use of seaplanes would merely lead to greater concentration of population on This bill sets out to exempt from the the seaboard, to the detriment of the incidence of sales tax goods to an annual development of the interior of the conwholesale value of Â£25,000,000, with a tinent. Land planes may be expected to consequent annual loss to the revenue of [14] equal to that achieved by our existing principal means of development, the railways which radiate from different centres into the heart of the continent. In his discussions in New Zealand, the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) should keep in the forefront of 'hi* mind the two points that I have raised. It seems obvious to me that, if we deprive the aerial services of the opportunity to carry mails across Australia's -interior, ' we shall withdraw 'an incentive to the development of those centres. Their enthusiasm and interest in such -Sevelopment must be maintained and eneouraged. Debate interrupted under Standing Order No. 257B.

149,Mr Casey (Corio,"Treasurer)approximately Â£1,000,000 or, for the balance of this nnancial year, about Â£650,000. I do not propose to rehearse the exemptions which have been made in the past. I merely say that they have not been made haphazard, but have followed along lines designed to give relief where it was, and is, most needed. In 1932, exemptions were made mainly in aid of the farming and pastoral indus\ remember, were then struggling for their existence. Since that year the general plan has been to provide 'for exemptions in respect of aids to primary production generally; necossary foodstuffs, and other prime necessaries of life, in order of set purpose to lessen the burden of the tax on persons on the lower ranges of income; building materials, in order to stimulate the building industry and thus assist towards the absorption of the unemployed; those things which are needed by the sick and the afflicted; and the requirements of religion, education, science and the like. The list of goods which the Government proposes that this measure shall exempt, with the estimated loss to the revenue, is, brieflv, as follows:Footwear Tea, coffee and cocoa .. Aids to manufacture Lubricating oils and greases . . 100,000 Removal of exemption conditions Correction of anomalies Tailors (reduction of sale value from 66 per cent, to 50 per cent.) Those, broadly, are the classes of exemptions which the Government is submitting. More than one-half of the relief which the bill proposes to give is represented by the two items, footwear and tea, which, between them, involve a loss of revenue of over Â£500,000. They will add substantially to the already very large field of exempt goods which come within the category of necessaries of life -some concessional adjustment in favour guarantee that the benefit of the exemptions will be passed on to the purchasers of the goods? be able to give an assurance in that direction when the bill reaches the committee stage. Footwear and tea figure prominently in the regimens adopted by the Arbitration Court for the measurement and adjustment of the basic wage. The Government has always had closely in mind the items which enter into the Arbitration Court's regimen, when selecting items for exemption. In making footwear and tea the principal items in the present list of exemptions, it believes that it is acting in the best interests of those who are on the lower ranges of income tries, which, as honourable members will and thus are in the least favorable position to pay sales tax. When the present list of exemptions becomes effective, the amount of sales tax payable by the average worker on the basic wage will be approximately Id. a day. I state that in order to indicate that the Government has been continuously concerned to ensure that the sales tax burden shall fall as lightly as possible upon those sections of the community which are least able to bear it. Clothing represents practically the only field which remains for the provision of further relief of a similar nature. The possibilities of this field have been explored very carefully, but not with very promising results. Apart from the fact that clothing as a general term includes .articles of luxury as well Â£ .. .. 302,000 as. articles of necessity, it appears that ' .. 200,000 any attempt to make clothing of a wide 156,000 range-that is, other than footwearfully exempt from sales tax, would be 104,000 .. 50,000 productive of a large number of serious commercial and administrative difficulties. However, the position of tailors has been 35,000 specially investigated in response to the many requests made both in and out of Parliament that such persons should be excluded from the field of registered taxpayers. The investigation disclosed many reasons why such requests could not be acceded to. It became clear, for example, that many competitive anomalies would arise if all tailors were deregistered. Nevertheless, the Government feels that of registered tailors is desirable in view of the fact that over 40 per cent, of the tailors in Australia are unregistered because their turnover is within the exemption limit of Â£1,000. It is hoped that the reduction of the taxable sale value from 66 per cent, to 50 per cent, of the sale price in the case of registered",35,Second Reading

151,Mr Casey,"I believe that I shalltailors will materially improve the posicirculate a memorandum containing a list tion, and will go far to remove the competitive inequality which may at present exist between registered and unregistered .tailors. Another most important feature of the bill is the proposed exemption of what may be briefly described as "" consumable aids to manufacture."" This will involve an annual loss of revenue amounting, at 4 per cent., to Â£156,000. The bill also contains provision for the exemption of lubricating oils and greases-involvin g a loss of Â£100,000 per annum-which , in many of tbeir uses, fall within the category of consumable aids to manufacture. "" Aids to manufacture "" may be divided roughly into three classes. The broad description of aids to manufacture may be said to be those things which are used in the production of goods, but which do not enter into the finished goods themform them whether the materials are selves. The factory building, and the plant therein are, broadly speaking, within this category. moulds, tools and dies are aids to wide range chemicals, which are used up or consumed in the course of manufacture. It is this latter class alone that the bill seeks to exempt from sales tax. The exemption will not apply to factory builddepartment has now arrived at a definiing, machiuory, plant, jigs, moulds, dies, &c. To the manufacturer these aids to manufacture are just as much direct charges against his output as aTe the raw materials which become ingredients of his products. In many cases it is a matgeneral terms. ter of great difficulty to determine whether they are merely aids to manufacture or whether they are entitled to be during the committee stages of the bill, treated as raw materials on the ground that they leave some essential element in the finished product. This has been a constant source of trouble to the Taxation Department and to the manufacturers. I have been given to understand that, ever since the introduction of the sales tax, pressure has been brought to bear by the manufacturers for the exemption of consumable aids to manufacture, and I know that during the last three years, while I have been at the Treasury, repremay, in certain circumstances, be used sentations along these lines have been very frequent. At a later stage I shall of fifteen typical industries, and typical aids to manufacture associated with them. list prepared? quiry was conducted by officers of the department in conjunction with a large number of manufacturers in order to arrive at the definition contained in this measure. manufacturers who knew nothing about the inquiry. auy doubt, it is a simple matter for them to approach tlie department with a list of materials which they believe should be exempt, and a description of the conditions under whicli they are used. Tlie department will then be able to inexempt or not. The difficulty in the way of granting a general request for Again, jigs, exemption of aids to manufacture has always been, ' first, tbe unknown but manufacture, as well as a necessarily large amount of revenue of materials, mostly involved, and, secondly, the apparent impossibility of achieving a satisfactory definition of the class of goods to be covered. After the most painstaking inquiry, extending over many months, the tion which it is believed will enable a satisfactory exemption to be provided. This definition appears in clause 3 a of the bill. Except for the goods specifically included , in. paragraph g of that definition, and specifically excluded in paragraph h, the definition is necessarily in I shall explain the definition in detail and shall also provide honourable members with lists of the principal items to be exempt in typical industries. The exemption will not apply to any goods which come within the category of machinery, tools, implements or other plant. I desire to make that perfectly clear, because I am aware that some manufacturers are seeking exemption for what might be described as "" disappearing tools"", or other mechanical aids which up with such rapidity that they are just as directly a charge upon output as are",36,Second Reading

155,Mr Casey,"If manufacturers are inocnisunrable aids in the nature of chemicals,. &a. For instance, in some manufacturing prooesses files may last for only a few hours. However, the possibility of a practical exemption of disappearing tools was rejected after the most careful and sympathetic consideration. It was found that tools which were rapidly used up in certain circumstances were usually capable of prolonged or indefinite use in other circumstances, and the conclusion was reached that, short of a complete exemption of. all manufacturing machinery and plant, any attempt to exempt disappearing tools and like aids to manufacture would involve the impossible task of laying down, detailed rulesfor. application to each industry, and even to. individual manufacturers who pursued varying methods of production within a particular industry. An attempt was made under the Canadian sales tax law to do this very thing. For a few years, the Canadian act contained an exemption to all aids to manufacture except permanent plant and equipment, but the provision was found to be impracticable, and the exemption wasrepealed in 1933. It is interesting to point out that the definition of aids to manufacture contained in this bill is very closely comparable with that in the Canadian act, : although the two were arrived at independently. One other important point to note is that the main provision for the exemption of consumable aids to manufacture will be contained in a regulation authorizing registered manufacturers to quote their certificates when purchasing or importing such goods. The estnliliphed procedure in connection with the quotation of certificates has been found to work more smoothly and more satisfactorily than that of furnishing certificates that the goods purchased or imported will be used for specified purposes. The definition in this bill of aids to manufacture will purposes of the proposed tion on the date of assent to . the bill. The exemption in the bill is limited to unregistered manufacturers, and is necessary, because such persons arc unable to quote registration certificates. tion to the various provisions already Mr (Jasey. referred to, there will be an exemption of goods manufactured by any person, and applied to his own use as aide to manufacture, so long as these aids come within the definition in the bill. The exemption of lubricating oils and greases is designed to apply to oils and greases for use as lubricants of machinery, implements and apparatus of every possible description and use, such as industrial, private and domestic implements and machinery. Oils and greases for lubricating manufacturing machinery would be covered by the exemption of aids to manufacture. An attempt, has been made to cause the. exemption to be as nearly as possible unconditional, and, as I have already stated, the relief involved by this exemption is estimated' at about Â£100,000 per annum. Mr Hr/TCHrrrsoN -Will tbe exempt tion. apply to motoT car oil ? The past practice of granting exemptions that were conditional on the goods being used for some specific purpose has causeda considerable amount of trouble and inconvenience, and the opportunity presented by the introduction of this bill has been taken to extend the range of the. most outstanding and vexatious of these conditional exemptions by making' them unconditional. Relief from sales tax. to the extent of Â£104,000 a year will be provided to this end. The essential cause of the trouble lies in the necessity, in order to prevent wholesale fraud or evar sion, for obtaining reasonably satisfaotory evidence from vendorsthat the goods for which they claim exemption will be used by consumers under conditions which satisfy the terms of the exemption. 'Certain merchants are disposed to treat the goods as exempt without bothering to obtain the required supporting evidence. The more conscientious merchant-and he is in the great be adopted for the majority-is faced with the alternaregulative of alienating custom by insisting which will be promulgated upon the required evidence, or of absorbing thetax himself where, bis customers will neither produce the requiredevidence, nor accept a charge for the tax: These are burdens which add materially In addito the merrhants' sales tax costs, and which the bill is designed to remove.",37,Second Reading
156,Mr Casey,"Yes.Tlie Government is sympathetic with ihe merchants concerned, and, for the last twelve months, the Taxation Department, with the approval of the Government, has been examining the wholeposition with a view to discovering waysand means by which the difficulties of tlie merchants-and there are complementary administrative difficulties-ca n be alleviated.. The. remedy which suggests itself is the removal of the conditions of all exemptions. It requires little examination to realize that such a remedy isimpracticable. For example, take the case of goodsfor use by goveun mentdepartments, and public hospitals. To remove the conditions, as to use in such case would mean the exemption of all goods.. Most of the sales tax exemptions are. conditional in. greater or lesser degree,, and investigation has shown that there are definite limitations to the relief which can be provided in the manner suggested. proposes to follow the policy of removing the conditions of exemptions: wherever that is practicable,, and whenever revenue requirements permit; also to avoid as far as possible the provision of further exemptions to which troublesome conditions are attached. This bill contains an important instalment of provisions prepared in pursuance of this policy. Actually the items now selected for the removal of conditions of exemption constitute the whole of the items which, as far as investigations have gone, can be dealt with in that manner without the creation of new difficulties. The items mainly affected cover certain classes of goods sold: by wholesale hard-ware merchants who, because of the enormous variety of taxable, exempt and conditionally exempt goods in which they deal, are the worse sufferers from the troubles of conditional' exemptions. The main hardware items, are piping, glass, copper, muntz metal and lead sheets. The bill provides for the exemption of these items in all circumstances. The details can be dealt with at the committee stage. Explosives are now exempt for mining, and clearing land, but not for quarrying. Fuel oil is now exempt for power, but not for heating. Bitumen and bituminous emulsions are now exempt for public road-making,, but not for. parksand gardens or private foot* paths. These items will be unconditionally exempt. Before turning to the remaining features of the bill, I should state that the removal of exemption conditions is only one of several proposals 1 in contemplation for the alleviationof the sales tax difficulties of taxpayers.. Some of these proposals will becontained in machinery measures to be brought down within the next few weeks;. others will be provided for by amendment of the regulations. It would not be appropriate forme to anticipate theprovisions that will be contained in the amend-' ing bill orbills, other than to say that they have been the result of a very greait deal of thought aaid investigation by the officers of my department over the last twelve months, and I feel sure that they will be greatly appreciated by thetracNevertheless,, the Government ing community. They will not affect the revenue to any appreciable, extent. The features of the biifl which I have not. yet touched, upon: probably take up fiie greater part of the measure, but are of relatively minor significance asfar as' the revenueisconcerned. I refer to exemptionsdesigned to remove competir tiwe anomalies. The cases to be provided for have been selected in the course of the careful survey which is being continuously made of the incidence of the sales tax, and of the. operation of the sales tax exemptions, and, amongst the hundreds of cases surveyed, they represent tbe most outstanding of the anomalies which, are capable of correction by way of exemptions. I shall give a few illustrations of these cases by reference to exemptions proposed hy the bill.. Butter printing, moulding: and wrapping machines are exempt when far use. by butter manufacturers,, but taxable when for use by organizations, representing butter manufacturers.. Lines,, hooks, &c, for use in the fishing, industry, are to be exempt. This is designed to^ place "" hooking "" ports on a. par with "" netting"" ports, as the latter now enjoy an exemption of fishing nets, &c. The exemption ofdried hops is to cover kiln-dried hops, which are: in competition with exempt sun-dried hops. Icing sugar mixtures are merely icing, sugar plusa slight addition of other materials. Pure icing sugar is exempt. The distinction is a competitive anomaly, which .is provocative of evasions which are difficult to detect. Solid 0O2, or ""dry ice,"" is in direct competition with ordinary ice, which is exempt in the packing of ice cream, chilled meat, &c, for transport. Stereotypes, &c, are at present exempt. Metal used in their production is exempt when the stereotypes are for newspapers, but are taxable in other circumstances, fltereotypers cannot tell when they purchase stereotype metal whether it will bo used for taxable or exempt purposes. When the stereotype is made, the task of separating its taxable and exempt uses has proved to be impracticable. The bill proposes to exempt these goods and the raw materials in all circumstances. Anomalies in all of the other cases provided for are equally clear, and will be fully explained, if necessary, at the committee stage. At tliis point, I should like to refer the public and to the Government, than to a matter which, although not specithe frequent publication of revised fically related to any of the provisions of editions of the main book.

It is only through the experience of several years that constructive reform has become possible. I maintain that the fullest possible advantage has been taken of that experience within the time available. I point particularly to the following:(1) The concentrated efforts over the last two years to .discover and correct business anomalies and difficulties; (2) The careful investigations which have been made throughout Australia into every complaint of substance against the operation of the tax; (3) The consolidation and classification of the sales tax exemptions effected last year by the Sales Tax Exemptions Act; (4) The constructive arrangements which have been completed for the publicity of sales tax rulings; (5) The liberal proposals of this bill and of other measures for sales tax relief which are contemplated in connection with the present budget.

It is true that the Government is responsible for the introduction of* the measures relating to taxation and expenditure, but it would be a distinct surety 'to the authority ;of Parliament if we were io deal with tlie ""budget first and consequential legislation afterwards. Once the principles of the budget were confirmed, it would be quite an easy matter to -decide bow far the proposals in a bill before the House at a particular time should be agreed with. This legislation, for example, contemplates a reduction of the rates of sales tax from 5 per cent, to 4 per cent., and it tleals with nothing else. Even the exemptions bill, which has just been introduced, can be regarded as involving the rate of tax, because if the -rate be not reduced, as this bill seeks to seduce it, it is clear the Treasurer might be able to increase the contemplated list of exemptions. proposals for the reduction of the -rates of income tax are not endorsed by the Parliament, then the revenue -which would arise as the result -of retaining the present Tates of income tax would make it possible for the Treasurer to reduce sales tax to a figure lower -than 4 per *ent. instead -of merely from 5 per cent, to 4 per cent. Tax: payers generally 'should be taken ""into account when -dealing with any particnlar form of taxation. In the present circumstances, immediately reply to any question as to why sales tax should not be reduced to a'figure lower than 4 per cent, by saying that such action w^uld upset the whole of ""his budget proposals. Consequently, we are not in a position to indicate how hv conld compensate the Treasury for the .amount of money lost through a further contraction of sales tax. The Opposition, however, will not oppose this legislation as it stands. Disregarding exemptions, it will save the taxpayers about Â£2,000,000 in taxes. But I question Avhether the reduction to be effected by the rates bill will be of any value to the poorer sections of the community. This bill proposes to effect a reduction of tax to .tie extent of Â£1 for every Â£100 worth of goods purchased. The average workman purchases goods : in quantities of a considerably less v.alue than Â£100. Usually, he buys Â£1 worth of goods. This saving of Â£1 in the sales tax on every Â£100 worth of goods represents, in practice, a saving of 2^d. for every Â£1 worth of goods purchased. In all probability the retailer will not reduce prices by the infinitesimal amount of tax thus saved on every -retail transaction. I doubt whether the Treasurer would attempt to dispute that statement. -6 per cent, would be reflected in an increase of the cost of goods. of tax does not necessarily mean a corresponding reduction of the price of .goods. I am pointing out that the piecemeal reduction .of taxation, which daring the period of its imposition tended to harden the prices of commodities, will not reduce the cost of living. It would have been far wiser if the Government had not proAgain, if the vided so extensive a list of exemptions in previous legislation and had reduced the rate of tax, for any advantage gained in that way might have 'been spread over the whole community. Originally the sales tax did ""not -apply to .any foodstuffs.

It seems to me that while the: price of footwear may be reduced by 5 per cent., the price of shirts is unlikely to be reduced at all, for the amount of the remission is so infinitesimal that traders will not consider it sufficient to justify a reduction of price. If that should be the case, consumers will receive no benefit from this remission-. It may happen' that the"" slice of f "" from the revenue of Â£2,000,000 may benefit the business community without giving any corresponding benefit to the consumers. I am perturbed lest this amount of revenue Government is sacrificing may not be reflected in an aggregate reduction of the cost of living to the same amount. If the honourable gentlemen opposite can show me that the workers will get their proportionate share of the amount which this remission of taxation represents, I shall have greater confidence in allowing, the bill to pass than I have at present. It can, of course, be said that the sales tax legislation was enacted primarily as' a measure of financial emergency, and. that with the improvement in the financial position of the Commonwealth it is not unreasonable that the two principles implicit in the legislation, tax and exemption, should be, in the first instance, community generally. I wish to spend a gradually reduced, and, in the second instance, gradually widened. That might be a justifiable argument for the Treasurer to advance in. support of this bill, but, in my opinion, it would have been wiser, on the balance, to maintain the rate of direct tax in respect of incomes nt a somewhat higher level than that contemplated by the Treasurer in his budget speech and to have made possible thereby an increase of the amount of savings which this measure contemplates in respect of the cost of living. Let me put it in another way. In order to make an effective reduction of indirect taxation, it might have been necessary to retain the rate of direct taxation at a figure higher than that contemplated in the budget. However, the Treasurer has made bis choice. He says he prefers to maintain a very considerable rate of tax upon commodities, thus affectinc the cost of livinc, rather than to maintain income taxation at its present figure. The Standing Orders preclude me from proposing an, amendment to this bill ta provide an alternative course to that suggested by the Treasurer. If I urge? that, the-rate of tax be reduced, the honourable gentleman will, immediately saythat he needs the revenue. As I cannot, move in this measure in such a way asi to affect exemptions, and cannot proposal any variationof the forms of taxation in; order to ensure greater relief to the taxpayer, I am compelled tosupport tha measure. Government and the Treasurer( Mr which the Commonwealth Casey) areto be congratulated on being, in a position to introduce this bill. As the Leader of the Opposition) ( Mr Curtin) has pointed out, this; tax was originally imposed in a time of financial emergency. 2STo one expected: that at this stage it could be entirely abolished. That being the case, the. Treasurer has adopted the course which will give most satisfaction to the business community generally, in that he has. reduced the rate of tax by 20per cent, and' has also enlarged thelist of exemptions, thereby opening the way for the removalof many anomalies which have been causing a. certain amount of discontent among manufacturers and the business' few moments in replying to the criticism of the Leader of the Opposition that the benefit of this remission may not be passed on to the poorer sections of the community. It is my view that benefits' of this kind will inevitably spread themselves over the whole community, either by effecting a reduction in the cost of thearticles purchased by the consumer; or by leaving to the manufacturer an additional amount of capital for investment in other directions. If the price of the article affected is reduced, the consumer receives a direct benefit; if the manufacturer retains the benefit of the tax remission he has more capital available for investment, and thus additional employment is provided for the peopleIn either event, the reduction of taxation now eontemp^fed will release ournbasirrg' power to the value of Â£2,000,000'.

171,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [8.20],"Th eof such a remission of taxation. To me a remission of taxation of this kind must ultimately benefit every section of the community and not only the people to -whom it is immediately applicable. I congratulate the Government upon releasing an additional Â£2,000,000 worth of purchasing power by this direct remission of taxation, and I believe that there will thereby be effected a general improvement of the economic conditions of the whole commimity. If any additional justification were needed for the fears expressed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), it has been provided by the speech of the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr is evident that neither the Leader of the Holt), who asserted that the passage of this legislation would be a source of great satisfaction to business interests. That statement is a complete vindication of the protest of the Leader of the Opposition against this method of reducing taxation. Many honourable members on this side of the House feel that the poorer section of the people will not participate in the benemodities affected by the reduction of sales fits that will follow this reduction of taxation.

The honourable gentleman should remember that competition is a great leveller, and will ensure the adjustment of prices in accordance with this remission of taxation. It Opposition ( Mr Curtin) nor the honourable member for Hindmarsh appreciates all the ramifications of business relations, or understands how effectively competition controls prices. Certain honourable gentlemen opposite who are interjecting may rest assured that competition will force the prices of the comtax to fall to their proper levels; but in any case I have sufficient knowledge of business practices to rest content that the competition that develops between manufacturers and the wholesale traders will bo reflected in the retail trade, and that the whole of the amount of tax now being who should benefit.

175,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"that the depression hung ou for so long, because of the consistent falling off of demand by the consuming public, entirely due to the lack of purchasing power among those persons who spend every penny that comes their way as fast as they can get it . If I were criticizing this measure in any way, I should say that the best means of helping the public generally, including the struggling business man, would be to select certain lines of goods, and remit the sales tax altogether on them. To this end the Treasurer has selected tlie boot industry. Unless there is some criminal avariciousness displayed by the manufacturers, which I do not sifggest, the people who purchase footwear must immediately obtain the benefit of the removal of a sales tax of 5 per cent. There will be no difficulty ahout passing on the concession, and it w ill increase the number of boots, shoes and slippers which are used by the general increased demand will assist the manufacturer by enabling him to add to the number of units which are turned over by him. Perhaps the Treasurer was influenced .by this possibility. the boot industry is an outstanding illustration of oivt'-capitalixation ever since the war period. Indeed, it has not yet got back td an even-keel, and therefore, there can lje no suggestion that auy saving of sales tax which might be retained by the employer, because it is too small to pass on. may help lum to extend his operations, add to his plant, or recapitalize more money into his business. The industry already has gone too f a r in that direction. effect it would have on the average manufacturer would be to give h i m some new impetus by the extra demand for the goods he produces. achieve that end is to remit the tax altogether on a section of trade as the Minister has done in regard to the boot industry. orable member that this bill does not reduces it. to .4 per cent. This measure deal with exemptions. had selected a group of industries, and come before the House, I have opposed remitted tbe tax on their products, the them, because I did not think that they remission would immediately have been were in the best interests of the business passed on to the consumers, and tbe in and trading community. In my opinion creased demand occasioned thereby would have assisted the manufacturers. A t least that is how I understand economics. Regardless of the goods that a manufacturer produces lie cannot reduce his prices unless the Government takes some action to add to the purchasing power of the people in order to increase the demand. During the boom years a manufacturer w ill add to his plant, and w ill recapitalize every penny of to-day's profit for the morrow. But in depression years he cannot follow that policy, and thereby the people of Australia suffer. For instance, they are suffering because of the over-capitalization of industries in Lancashire. Where the sales tax has been remitted altogether, the benefit can be at once passed on to the consumers who will receive an immediate advantage from it . The manufacturers themselves will also profit thereby, because a. greater demand for their goods public. .Furthermore, that will be created. By remitting only i per cent, of sales tax, however, no section of the community will be assisted. The reduction will not be passed on, not because a manufacturer is a criminal, but Actually because, in many instances, he is not in a position to pass it on to the public. The advantage he gets will go into "" cold storage,"" as it were, because his plant is not running at f u l l capacity, and he does not desire to add to i l . For this reason a manufacturer will not consider the recapitalization of any more of his money by putting up more pulley wheels, and another foot or so of shafting. The only means by which he can be assisted is by tlie total abolition of the tax upon The only advantageous certain lines, in order to create a greater demand for goods and services, and increase tbe turnover, which in tur n w ill increase the units which w ill bring h i m Tlie only way to profits. sales tax is being reduced by successive singes.

T8.40] -In supporting the bill, I congratulate the .Treasurer ( Mr Casey) on making provision 'for the reduction of 1 per cent, an the sales tax, which will remit taxation from this source to an amount of Â£2,000,0.00. There is a good .deal to be said for the contention of the .honourable member for Melbourne Ports l( Mr Holloway) that it would be far more advantageous to the consumer if the .sales tax exemptions provided .for ithe exemption of a list of certain commodities from the imposition, instead of a reduction of 1 per cent, of the total, it would assure to the consumer the possibility of securing some advantage from the reduction, and it would not in any way mitigate against his .securing the advantage of the concession of Â£2,000,000, Jbecause the -reduced price of the goods so Exempted would be the means of proividing him with it. The Treasurer has 2had many lists of proposed exemptions tSttbmitted to him, and they include many -items which -could make up .the total of sÂ£2^000,000. Whilst the adoption of such ia -.course would have been advantageous -to the consuming public, it would also have benefited the manufacturer. There is also an important reason, that 'has not been stated by honourable members, for taking the course which I have .suggested. The sales tax, even with the exemption of 1 per cent., is still difficult 'for the business man to calculate, and t3ie reduction docs not lighten the work of book-keeping and the general ramifications of the collection of a tax, which is very difficult. The reduction of the tax from 5 per cent, to 4 per cent, actually makes the position more difficult for the business community. If we were to exempt Â£2,000,000 worth of goods altogether from sales tax, we should be lifting from the business :man a burden which he seeks to have removed, and which he genuinely claims it is our duty as -early as possible to remove. 'There are excellent reasons ""why, in future, when 'further remissions of fhe sales -tax are contemplated, the -tax should be lifted irom 'certain ""lines in their -entirety, instead of spreading the reduction over all classes of goods. That course would be of considerable general advantage. the year the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has listened very carefully to the claims of many interests for exemptions from sales tax, and I fear that honourable members of this .House have continually placed before him the desirability, not of granting further exemptions, but of reducing -the tax to .at least 2^ per cent. In my .opinion, the .sales tax is such a money-spinner to the Treasury that, even if -the Opposition were :in power to-morrow, it would not attempt to remit the tax. The Scullin Government imposed it, and I have no doubt that, if a Labour govern.ment were to come into office, it would -.continue the tax because in its incidence the money comes to the Treasury whenever goods are changing hands. In my opinion, however, a sales tax is unfair and unjust. It was imposed as an emergency measure, and if there is any possibility of lifting it, it would be better to do so -even though -such a course .involved an increase of .direct taxation. Such a burden as the sales tax should 'not be borne 'by the poorer sections of the community. Commercial interests regard the reduction of the sales tax by 1 per cent, as being of little or no value to them, because the expense of preparing returns for submission to the Commissioner of Taxation costs infinitely more than is represented by the proposed, reduction. Genuine complaint is made by every individual who is required to prepare returns for the purposes of sales tax.

I cannot conceive of honourable members opposite believing that the proposed reduction is not a good thing. I have every confidence that the saving of Â£2,000,000 will be passed on to the Australian community. As thu honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison) has said, the only portion of it which will not be passed on is that which was previously imposed but had to be borne by the merchants because they could not pass it on. It will be retained by them to make up for past losses. That, however, represents a very small proportion of the total. If it may be said that the reduction of 1 per cent, is not worthwhile, it may just as well be said that there would lie no harm in raising it by that percentage. an argument, if carried to its logical conclusion, would mean the maintenance of the present rate of 5 per cent. As tbe Government is financially able to do so, it believes that it should reduce this tax in common with other taxes.

197,Mr Casey,"In accordance withHonorable members are no doubt aware that the special grants to be paid to the three States under notice have constituted a very difficult problem for many years. The grounds upon which these special grants were originally claimed were the disabilities due to federation, or the effects of federal policy, and a number of attempts has been made by various bodies and authorities to assess in terms of money the effects of such disabilities on the finances of the States concerned, without any permanent solution of the problem being reached. In 1933, the Oommonwealth Grants Commission Act was passed by this Parliament, and under that act the commission was established. It waa hoped at the time that the commission would be able to formulate a policy which the Government could adopt, and under which the grants to the States could be placed on a more stable, and, possibly, a more permanent basis. The commission has now submitted three reports, the last of which, as I have mentioned, was recently tabled. The recommendations of tbe commission for the last two years, 1934-35 and 1935-36, were adopted by the Government, and grants were passed by Parliament in accordance with those recommendations. On each of those occasions the grants recommended represented an appreciable increase on the grants of the preceding year. It is proposed that the recommendations of the commission this year shall also be accepted, and it is on this basis that these three States grants bills are submitted to the House. As I have said, prior to the appointment of the Grants Commission, the claims of the States were based on the grounds of "" disabilities,"" and were considered from that aspect. The commission has, however, since its first report, stated that it found itself unable to assess the grants on the basis of "" disabilities,"" quarters that payment of grants to the and has consistently based its recomStates should be based upon the financial mendations on ""financia l needs"". In effect of disabilities due to federation its second report, the commission made or federal policy. tbe following comments in support of the by evidence which was submitted as basis of assessing the amounts of special recently as this year to the Grants Comgrants according to the financial needs of mission by the representatives of certain the States concerned:The adverse effects of federation may be the cause, in whole or in part, of the inferior the commission in its latest report has financial position of a State. It is, however, had to say upon that particular phase of the relative financial position (i.e., of any one State compared .with the other States) which determines whether a grant' is justified. (Paragraph 72.) Special grants are only an extension of the normal system. The problem of recommending them is to determine how much the transfer should be for any particular State in excess of the amount provided by the normal Bystem. We find that this should be the amount necessary to enable the State Government to function at some minimum standard, and that this amount must be determined by a searchinjj examination of the comparative financial position of the State. We have found no ground for compensating the people of a State for disabilities due to federation or any other causes. Disabilities due to federal policy may be the cause of the inferior position of a State'sfinances,but a variety of other causes may have the same effect. (Paragraphs 78 and 7B.) little while ago was strongly in favour of assessing grants on the basis of disabilities due to federation. Honourable member can show us how to assess the net disabilities of a State under federation, I shall be obliged to him. In its third report, the commission has repeated its opinion that the grants payable to the States should be based only upon financial needs, as w ill be seen from the following extract:JC4. In our second report we developed the tentative principles of the first, and concluded that tbe relative financial position of tbe States, when analysed with sufficient care and understanding, was the only basis on which special grants should be made. Further consideration and another year's experience have led us to the following conclusion:Special grants are justified when a State through financial stress from any cause is unable efficiently to discharge ita functions as a member of the federation and should be determined by the amount of belp found necessary to make it possible for that State by reasonable effort to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States. The view is still held in certain This is borne out of the State governments concerned. On this point, it is interesting to note what",48,South Australia Grant Bill Ing Table

199,Mr Casey,"And it still is. If thethe subject. The attitude of the commission has been that, in considering the effects of federation or federal policy on the finances of the States, it is necessary to take into account, not only the adverse effects, but also the benefits which a State may derive from federation or federal policy. The commission has made a genuine effort to place a monetary value upon the net effects of federation. Let me quote what the commission has to say in regard to thisI t follows that unless the adverse effects of the federation, and that the special federal policy on the claimant States exceed tlie benefits duo to tlie allocation of Commonwealth revenue and expenditure, there are no adverse net effects of federation. graph 120). The measurement of the total net effect of federation is clearly nn impossible task. . . . Wc can, however, make 60iue rough approximation. (Paragraph 127). The commission has made an attempt to ascertain in an approximate way the effects of federation, and, after weighing all the evidence, concludes with the.following finding:It appears then that without reckoning any benefit from exchange, benefits and burdens from federation almost balance for South Australia and Western Australia, while for Tasmania there is a net benefit of nearly f 1 por head. It follows' that no substantial part of the special grant received was made necessary by the effects of federation. We may conclude tliat these States unfederated would have been at least in tlic same financial diffiSouth Wales invalidates the whole culties as at present. (Paragraph 140). This is the conclusion to be drawn from the estimates of tariff effects offered by the States of the Commonwealth, having regard to themselves. For the reasons given above they cannot be regarded as satisfactory, nor are they put forward by tlie representatives of tbe States aa giving a complete and valid answer to the question of tariff effects. We may say, however, that on the principles adopted it appears that the Western Australian figure understates the burden for thai State, while the figure for South Australia is probably too high. No possible correction, however, will sensibly modify tbe conclusion that the major cause of the relatively inferior financial position of the claimant States is not to be found in federation or federal policy. (Paragraph 147). Although there may be some room for honest difference of opinion as to whether grants to the States should be based upon disabilities or upon financial needs, I submit that it would be difficult to gainsay the carefully worked out opinion of the Grants Commission in this regard, the gist of which I have just quoted. If r . Casey. I have said sufficient, I think, to indicate the reasons why the commission has accepted the basis of measured financial needs in arriving at its recommendations as to the grants to be made, and I wish now very briefly to indicate the manner in which the financial needs of the States have bepn measured. The commission holds that special grants are justified when a State, through financial stress from any cause, is unable efficiently to discharge its functions as a member of grants should be determined by the amount of help necessary to make it possible for that State, by reasonable (Paraeffort, to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States. For the purposes of arriving at this standard the commission has adopted the plan of comparing the financial results of the claimant States with those of the non-claimant .States, after making such adjustments as are necessary to put them on a comparable basis. In making this comparison the commission has decided that the nearest approach to an Australian standard would be obtained by taking the simple average of Victoria and Queensland, as was done in the previous year, 1985-36. mathematical formula*, because New South Wales is the most important State the population and wealth.' come out any better foT the claimant Statesi f New South Wales were included.

Where the finances of the. claimant States show an improvement which is greater than the degree of improvement revealed by the finances of the non-claimant States, the amount of that grant is decreased. In the third report the commission bases its recommendations for the .year 1936-37 on the finances of the States for the year 1934-35, which were the latest figures available at the time of its inquiry. In that year the budget results of South Australia and Western Australia revealed a degree of improvement greater than that which was shown by the budgets of the non-claimant States, and the grants for those two States are accordingly recommended to be reduced. On the other hand, the finances of Tasmania during 1934-35, whilst better than for the preceding year, did not disclose an improvement equal to that revealed by tbe non-claimant States. recommended in the case of Tasmania is, therefore, greater than that for 1935-36. I have, I think, said sufficient to give gate for the two years, Â£890,000 more honourable members a bird's-eye view of than would have been paid if the 1933-34 the methods included in the commission's grants had' been continued, tbe Governlatest report, and upon which the recomment accepted those recommendations mendations for the grants for 1936-37 without question, and obtained parliamenhave now been based.

After a close study of the public finances of the Commonwealth and the States and of the general economic conditions of Australia, the commission feels that neither a constitutional amendment nor an automatic formula could really solve the basic problems which govern the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. The relative position of the States and the Commonwealth fluctuates so considerably that any mechanical caucus, he was expected to make a bitter formula or constitutional change may speedily become inapplicable and unjust. The commission considers that it is not possible for different governments functioning over an econpmic and political unit like Australia to divide their financial powers and resources into separate water-tight compartments. Some principle of adjustment is necessary and as conditions change considerably from .time to time the adjustment should be elastic. This view is consistent with tbe experience of all federations.

WhilstI congratulate the Government sympathize with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), who had a most difficult task in endeavouring to find fault with the budget. He is to be complimented upon the speech which he made under most adverse circumstances. No doubt at the behest of the Labour attack upon the Government in an endeavour to create hostility towards it, and in the circumstances he certainly made a valiant attempt to carry out his instructions. Every fair-minded member of the community, however, will be prepared to give the Government credit to which it is entitled. Opinions expressed by overseas journals indicate that the meritorious work of the Lyons Ministry The economic recovery internally in the last few years has been and the increased prices which primary producers have received for their exports. The benefits of the wise administration of the present Government are reflected in the expansion of trade and the development of primary and secondary industries throughout Australia. The savings deposited in the Commonwealth Savings Bank alone amount to no less a sum than Â£225,000,000, which is an increase of Â£32,000,000 since 1931. The further reductions of taxation that are .contemplated will probably increase development and greater activity in all sections of industry and among all classes.

The States have asked for an increase of the road grant, and they are to receive an increase of 20 per cent, upon the amount paid under the present agreements. Personally, I should have been inclined to resist the demands of the States for such an increase under present circumstances, and give petrol users some benefit. Although the Commonwealth Government gave way to the States in this regard, I commend it for resisting their further request for an increased payment from Commonwealth revenue. If the Commonwealth Government finds that it does not need any money which it has collected in taxes, it should return the surplus to the people tlirough remissions of taxes rather than band it over to the State governments to squander. If this were done I feel sure that the people of Australia would be better able to appreciate budgetary measures of relief. One honourable member contended that cent, in the rate of tax. Every section the less fortunate sections of the people of the community will readily give credit will not receive any' benefit under the to the Government for such relief relief provisions of this year's budget. measures. Remissions of income tax That is not. so. The relief from sales tax amount to Â£2.105,000 annually, whilst alone is Â£3,000,000. The invalid and oldprimage duty has been reduced by age pension has been increased by 2s. a Â£170,000 a year, making a total reduction fortnight, this concession accounting for of taxes of Â£5,275,000 a year. a total increase of the Government's pension payments by Â£1,000,000 a year. It by this Government I point out that if is nl! the more remarkable that this relief tlie amount of Â£2,750,000 now paid as has been given after provision has been special grants to the States annually were made for the remission of Â£5,250,000 in abolished, this Government could'remit taxes. The invalid and old-age pension an equivalent amount in further reducwill now be 19s. a week compared with tions of taxes. I suggest that it should 15s. a week a few years ago. Although follow this course, because, if this its total pensions bill will have increased were done, taxpayers throughout the to over Â£13,000,000, I hope that the ComCommonwealth would benefit by a more monwealth Government will soon find substantial reduction of taxes, and the itself in a position to increase the rate of States would not be treated unfairly.

The Government's employees are engaged in benefits thus accruing to the people would post offices, these employees have earned be more definite and effective, and the all the relief to be given to them tlirough results of this Government's administraa full restoration of their salaries. tion would be even more fully revealed [Quorum formed]. It is not difficult to than they are at present, by the displayed prove that the relief provisions of the budget will apply to the community generally. The war pensions provisions have been extended and additional facilities for hospital and medical treatment have been provided. The service pension has also been increased by Is. a week and the pension payable to the children of invalid soldiers by Is. 6d. a week. These aud other concessions to returned soldiers account for a total cost to the Government of Â£2.85,000 annually. The benefits of remissions of taxes made by this Government, will be enjoyed by the people generally. The reduction of sales tax will affect every individual. The Government is sincerely endeavouriug to continue its policy of reducing this tax, and this year's budget provides for a. reduction of Â£3,000,000 a year, this concession being made up of Â£1,000,000 through further exemptions and Â£2,000,000 through a reduction of 1 per Dealing with indirect concessions made South Wales might urge its claim for proposals, are the claim. As a Queenslander, I suggest that confidence in Australia within the community and overseas. During the term of office of the present Government an amount of Â£4,000,000 annually has been saved to Australia in the conversion of loans. This represents a direct benefit to the Commonwealth of only Â£850,000 a year, but tlie -States receive a direct benefit of Â£3,150,000 .a yea*. In claiming further assistance from this Government, the State Governments contend that the Commonwealth Government has been relieved of its war debt payments to the extent of about Â£3^000,000 annually. Yet we find that this Government has saved -the JStates no less than Â£3,150,000 annually in the conversion of State loans -in Britain. The one more than balances the other. Furthermore, we must remember that the Commonwealth Government is responsible for the. defence of Australia, and by its budprobable exception of Great Britain, has get this administration has shown that it is prepared to face that responsibility. From its revenue and savings it has provided no less than Â£8,809,000 for expenditure this year to safeguard the interests of every section of the people in maintaining sufficient defences in order that we may have at least some chance of defending ourselves in time of war. On a per capita basis this expenditure compares very favourably with similar expenditure by Great Britain. Furthermore, this Government has not found it necessary to borrow this sum; it had the foresight to make provision in previous years for this purpose, out of revenue which, I suggest, is something further to its credit. Probably no better illustration of the benefits resulting from the sound administration of this Government is provided than the increased building activity throughout Australia at the present time. In our capital cities and suburban areas the expenditure on building construction during the last three years has increased by Â£15,122,000. The prosperity of the building industry is of great importance to the unemployed, the artisans, the manufacturers and the people of Australia generally. Yet this is only a minor illustration of tbe industrial and economic recovery resulting from this Government's administration. covery is not due entirely to the policy Mr Bernard Corser. of the Government; it is influenced also by increased prices of commodities which we export overseas where our markets havo been protected and expanded. This Government has spent considerable money in providing more efficient marketing and in safeguarding markets once they have been obtained, and effective trade publicity has been carried out with the result that -even in Britain markets for our products have been considerably expanded. Sales of wool last year .contributed no less than .Â£58,000,000 to the -national income. A few years ago Austi'alia was supposed -to be bankrupt. Many of our people would have sold out, but there were no buyers. In any case, conditions were probably worse in other parts of the world than in Australia. To-day, it may be said that no country, with the made such a notable recovery as Australia. I direct attention, for a moment, to the great wheat industry of this country. Our wheat-growers have suffered for a long while because of the depressed price of wheat, and during the period of depression they were granted relief from Commonwealth sources to the extent of Â£14,000,000, not from loan moneys, but from revenue. Happily, however, the price of wheat recovered during the latter part of last season, and for the sevÂ«n months ended July, 1936, averaged 8s. 7Â£d. a bushel. Our wheat crop last year yielded Â£26,740,000. It cannot be claimed that conditions hi the dairying industry have improved very rapidly, but there has, nevertheless, been some betterment, and prices, although still low, are in advance of those -of a couple of years ago. The dairying industry provides housing and sustenance for probably more individuals than any other single industry in the Commonwealth, and is therefore deserving of the utmost consideration from the Government. I realize tlie value of the great wool industry to Australia, but I also know the importance of dairying.. The value of this industry cannot be measured by its export trade, for about half of its -production is consumed in That reAustralia. Moreover, a good deal of the dairy produce of Australia is turned into cheese or consumed as milk. Last year this industry yielded production worth about Â£40,000,000 to the Commonwealth, and, because of the fact that it sustains so many people on small farms, it is exceptionally useful. To enable effective dairying -to be .carried on, scrub lands have to be cleared, and intense settlement has to be fostered. This results in small townships being established -wherever dairying is pursued, and such settlement should be encouraged in -every way. I a-m iglad to say, also, that the beef and mutton exports from Australia have increased. This is not a great beef-producing country, and hitherto we have been unable to supply our full quota to the British market, but there is reasonable ground for the hope that very shortly we shall be able to do so. 'The imports into Australia last year of non-competitive goods reached the high, value of Â£85,000,000. As .these goods did not enter into competition with locally-manufactured articles, the trade they represented was worth cultivating in the interests of export trade. Such imports were made possible only by the sound administration of the finances of the country -by the Government, which resulted in an enlargement of the purchasing power of the people, f t is gratifying also that the motoring industry of the Commonwealth has developed to a point never before reached -our financial position will continue to This fact demonstrates beyond any question, the reality of our financial recovery. shortly find itself in a position to increase Tn qnany 'cases, even the peak figures of the pre-depres3ion years have been passed. It should be realized that the Commonwealth Government is responsible for the provision of many social services for the welfare of the community. Our actual expenditure last year on war service homes, war pensions and other repatriation activities, totalled Â£18,240,000. Payments to the States absorbed Â£14,500,000. Notwithstanding this fact, some State authorities are making increased claims on the Commonwealth Treasury, desiring to do most of the spending while the Commonwealth does more taxing. was paid for sugar. no doubt that the people who paid for sugar got it. the honourable member that a great deal .has been done to help the apple, pear, and small fruits industries of Tasmania. Sugar is provided by the Australian -industry for our fruit-growers at a price which, taking all the facts into consideration, is very reasonable. Some honourable gentlemen would like permission to be granted to certain interests to import sugar from couutries where black labour is employed, but they should bear in mind that if primage and a reasonable duty had to be paid on such sugar, and that if a bounty were provided on the production of beet sugar, as is done iu Great Britain, the price they would have to pay for the imported sugar would be higher than that which they pay for Australian-grown sugar. I do not look upon the sugar industry as belonging -to Queensland. It is a great Australian industry. The people of Tasmania should realize that Australia has its tropical as well as its southern regions, and that these must be developed. The Commonwealth Government is also responsible for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions, and the amount expended under this ""heading last year exceeded Â£13,000,000. I sincerely hope that improve so that the Government will the payments to these old people who did such fine pioneering work in the early days. had not handed ont so much to its wealthy supporters. know about that. Not much of it has come their way. I hope the honourable member is not double-crossing his own friends. of the people who helped to pay the honourable member's election expenses have benefited. M,r.

Another obligation whicli the Commonwealth Government has to meet is the payments to interest and sinking funds. These, as most honourable members are aware, are inescapable and no one can accuse the Government of extravagance in meeting these calls upon Government f unds. I am glad that an amount of Â£2,000,000 has been provided for public works to assist the unemployed. The budget also contemplates the. usual assistance to those engaged in the citrus fruit, and apple and pear industries. The amount provided under this heading is Â£82,000. It is gratifying also that the subsidy for the use of fertilizers is being continued, though at a lower rate. Taking a bird's eye view of the country we aro entitled to express our pride at the recovery that has been achieved. I hope that in thenext twelve months further financial improvement will be experienced so that additional reductions and remissions of taxation may be granted. The downward trend iu taxation is undoubtedly beneficial to the whole community. I am sure that Queensland, in common with the other States which are chiefly responsible for the provision of money for grants-in-aids to necessitous States, desire that some better method may be devised to assist those States than the provision of doles from the Treasury.

These included five which were supposedly frost-resistant. tubers were grown under glass and have been harvested for propagation and study, but they were, unfortunately, badly infected with virus diseases. As these supposedly frost-resistant varieties do not produce commercial types of tubers, thereby involving crossing, and bearing in mind the difficulties associated with the eradication of the virus diseases with which they have been infected, some years must elapse before these experiments are brought to conclusion.

International Position NnrriELD GIFT . the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr. Holt) stated that the budget papers showed a balance of Â£41,000 in the Lord NuffieldG if t Fund, and asked whether that f u n d is at present lying idle or is being used. In accordance w it h the Government's policy, the money donated by Lord Nuffield was vested in the Minister for Health as trustee, and is being used as the capital of the fund. Both ir.mrcst and capital wil l be expended gradually over a period of five years. Theg i ft was received in March, 1935, and was invested in Commonwealth inscribed stock. No expenditure was incurred prior to the 30th June, 1935. Up to the 30th June, 1936, the receipts 'of interes; of the fund were Â£1,368 and the axpeudituri Â£9,003, leaving a balance of Â£42,280. It w ill be seen that the fund is not lying idle but is being used carefully to the best advantage. For a very f u l l statement of the working of the fund I would refer the honourable member to the. report of the Australian Conference on CrippledI ' h i l . dren held in Canberrai n A p r i l last, copy of which can be consulted in the Parliamentary Library.",58,Broadcast Of Speeches Through National Stations
