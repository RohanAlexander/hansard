I am now in a position to furnish the following information:(a.) £130,000 per annum is paid to thc Orient Company as a mail subsidy. amount covers the conveyance by Orient contract vessels of mails from Australia to Great Britain and other countries, as well as from Great Britain and other countries to Australia. Great Britain and other countries pay the Commonwealth postal administration at the rates fixed by the Stockholm Postal Convention for the carriage of their mails by Orient contract vessels [vide answer to question (e) ) . The proportion of mails carried to Groat Britain by Orient contract vessels for the year 1920 was 20.2 per cent. (Zi) The Peninsular and Oriental vessels voyaging via Suez, and by which mails to Great Britain are despatched, are under contract to the British Post Office. The Comnioiiwealth Post Office pays the British Post Offiee at the Stockholm Convention rates for the carriage of mails from Australia by these Peninsular and Oriental Company's vessels. The amount that will be paid in respect of the year 1920 for the mails despatched to Great Britain is approximately £25,000. For the year 1920 Peninsular and Oriental Company contract vessels carried approximately 57.5 per cent, of the mails despatched from Australia tu Great Britain. .. £1,522 (c) Approximately £1,500 in respect of mails . . 2,878 despatched from Australia during 1920 for 50 delivery in GreatB r it a in ; payment was made 00 at thc Commonwealth regulation rates.

50,Mr Marr,"Yesterday the honorableby notice of variation of the plan of lay-out of the city of Canberra and its environs, 'appearing in the issue of the Commonwealth Gazette, date 29th October last? To that question I now desire to make the following reply:Most of the alterations made are of a minor character, and it is not considered that any of thom involves a departure from the basic principles of the Griffin design. They provide for the elimination of a number of the former roads, and the addition of certain new roads. In some cases, the roads previously gazetted would have been insufficient for residential sub-divisional purposes, unless the undesirable method of leaving vacant land at thc rear of allotments were to be followed. The new design provides open spaces in front of allotments. In a few cases, the development of previously gazetted roads could not have been effected without objectionable results, such as the destruction of the original Canberra rectory buildings, the partial destruction of an outstanding clump of native trees, and building in a water-course. In other cases, considerations of symmetry and convenience have been the determining factors. Misapprehension has arisen from the fact that ou the revised plan a proposed alternative railway route is indicated. I wish to mafce it quite clear that no alteration of the plan in respect of railway routes is involved. In submitting its recommendations for alterations of the plan, the Pederal Capital Commission advised, inter alia, that:The proposed alteration to the railway route shown by heavy dotted lines has been inserted for information only. This matter w ill be the subject of a separate report explaining what is contemplated, but is not put forward at the present time as an alteration to the plan. The positio n in regard to r a i l w a y routes m a y be summarised as f o l l o w s : 1. The commission has made preliminary investigation with the object of ascertaining thing that we have said. whether it would be advisable to recommend an alternative route for the city railway, but it has uot yet made any report to the Government on the subject, and the matter may be regarded as still in the inquiry stage. 2. Although a t r i a l survey of a route has. assisting the investigation referred to. 3. The alternative route to which the commission has 'been giving consideration has not been approved by the Government, or even Division1 -the Parliament-namely , "" The submitted to the Government, as prescribed, President, £1,300;"" be agreed to. as a proposed alteration to the city -plan.

They have represented to the Government that although, as I stated in the House during the debate on the second reading, I had freely consulted with them on the principles of those measures, they did not appreciate the exact intentions of the legislation as to the carrying out of the housing functions, and that on further consideration they are now of opinion that under the provisions of the measures the board ^could carry out their administration. To enable the board to do this an amendment is to be presented in another place to provide that until the commission is appointed the board will carry on the functions under the two bills. Should it become necessary at a later stage, for any good reasons, to establish the proposed separation by the appointment of the commission, that course could be adopted. This action is being taken with the cordial approval of the board. The amendment is being made in the Senate, but will be brought back to the House, when f u l l discussion can take place.

The £51,453,00 expenditure in. 1921-22 included war service. The estimated expenditure for this year also includes war service, interest on war loans, pensions, and so forth, and the cost of such services is less to-day than it was bold policy of economy, upon the preachthose principles? ing of which he attained office, the honourable gentleman has failed to justify himself as a Treasurer.

The budget exhibits a tendency to favour the rich at the expense of the poor. If any budget could be called a rich man's budget, this is it. Take the comparison between direct ancl indirect taxation. -The lionorable gentleman does not deal with that feature of the financial drift in his budget speech. He takes credit for 'bringing about tax reduction, but, actually, he had done nothing of the sort. The honourable gentleman has reduced the taxes payable by certain classes, but, generally, the taxes levied by this Government have increased enormously. of the Leader of the Opposition would increase them further. honourable member will be patient? There are certain maxims governing the principles of taxation that should be a guide to all democratic governments, maxims which have become classical canons of taxation. For the edification of the Treasurer I shall reiterate them and ask him if he is applying them. They are as follow:The subjects of a State ought to contribute towards the support of its government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities. In the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what is called the equality or inequality of taxation. The tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain, and not arbitrary. The time and manner of payment, and the amount to be paid, ought to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person. Every tax ought to be levied at a time and in a manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the taxpayer to pay it. Every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what is required to meet the current needs of the Government.

Avhether the honourable member suggests that I was the author of these alleged vindictive taxes have applied taxation, and I have been accused of adopting drastic methods, but I have endeavoured always to be true to the tenets which I have just quoted. One is able to tell fairly accurately Avhether direct taxation is falling equitably upon the community; but it is not possible to ascertain with certainty the incidence of indirect taxation. member Avas Premier of Queensland he applied certain taxation to a very small section of the community. to be equitable, must fall more heavily on small sections of the community than on the large bulk of the people, for under our present dispensation the small section is far better able to pay it . is a fallacy, for taxation is frequently jiassed on. some taxes may be passed on Avithout groat difficulty, but income and land taxation cannot easily be avoided. Indisputably the present Treasurer has heaped indirect taxes upon our people to such an extent that they haA-e become a crushing burden. adopted the taxation will be increased. read in the financial columns of practically every newspaper, statements by financial critics that the people are groaning under the weight of .the income and land taxation which they are obliged to pay, but these persons appear to forget that our Customs levies, and other indirect taxation, are an infinitely greater burden upon the people. pledged to reduce these. lessly failed to do so. the duties from no less than 50 articles. receipts from Customs are continually increasing. of the opinion that our Customs duties should be reduced? Customs revenue should be reduced. There is no justification for the hea\'y Customs imposts that this Government is making. In 1921-22, which was before the present Treasurer assumed office, our Customs receipts, excluding excise duties, amounted to £17,200,000; but this year the Treasurer is budgeting for £33,150,000. It Avill be seen, therefore, that the increase of Customs taxation since he has been in ofiice honourable has been more than' 91 per cent. Not a word appears in the budget speech to justify this. It is, in fact, unjustifiable and ruinous, for it has brought a great many eA'ils in its train. In the last complete financial year of the Hughes administration, land and income taxation and probate and succession dutiesI am leaving out of my calculation the amount received in Avar-time profits and entertainment taxes, for it was quite evident that the war-time profits tax would have to cease, and I do not regard the entertainments tax as a legitimate source of revenue for the Commonwealth-yielde d a total of £20,000,000. The Treasurer is this year budgeting for an income of £13,300,000 from these sources. The reduction in direct taxation since he has been in charge of the Treasury may be taken, therefore, to be 33^ per cent., while the increase in indirect taxation exceeds the amendment is 91 per cent. It is possible to ascertain, Avith a reasonable degree of accuracy, who pays, and, therefore, who is relieved of direct taxation; but that is not practicable in respect of indirect taxation.

It cannot be denied that every person in the community must contribute to this indirect taxation through the Customs Department. Since the Treasurer has been in office the imposition under this heading here in great quantities. Let us examine has been increased by £12 per family per annum. Now let us look at the reductions that are proposed. It is intended this year to allow a reduction of income tax of 10 per cent, to 11,000 persons in the community who are in receipt of an average income of £5,000 per annum. These people will be relieved of direct taxation to the extent of £54 each during this year, while numerous families which are supported upon an income of less than £250 per year will be obliged to pay £25 in indirect taxation. The Treasurer may say, in reply to this argument, that honourable members on -this side of the chamber assisted the Government to impose the Customs duties that are now operating. That would not be a legitimate answer, for the Treasurer and his confreres in the Gostandard of living that has been estabvernment are responsible for the fiscal policy that is now operating as well as for honourable members opposite are disguised the taxation that is being imposed toms taxation has been received because of the money that has been borrowed overseas. member for Wannon is barking up the wrong tree.

92,Mr Theodore,"T n arriving atsince the Treasurer took office. In 1922-23 there was an adverse balance of £13,800,000, and in the following year it amounted to £21,000,000. In the succeeding year there was a favorable trade balance of £4,800,000; but in the next year the balance was adverse again to the extent of £3,000,000. Last year we had an adverse balance of nearly £20,000,000, and the net adverse balance for the whole period was £53,000,000. Can the country continue in nnancial security or economic safety under such conditions? must be a drastic change. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) was perfectly sound in his argument so far as he touched on this subject in his speech last night. The continuance of the adverse trade balance is a menace to our prosperity, our development, and the maintenance of the social and industrial conditions that we have established. amounts to between £13,000,000 and £14,000,000 for the first quarter of the present year. Therefore, the position is becoming worse. nately, true. I have endeavoured to show that the Government has taken no effective steps to rectify the position. Heavy indirect taxes have to be borne by the people as a result of a faulty financial, policy. This year the Treasurer proposes reductions in income and land taxes. Has he shown in the budget speech that the income taxes now imposed are burdensome, or so inequitable that they operate unfairly in any quarter, or that those paying them are demanding aud should nave relief to the extent of 10 per cent. ? What class is to benefit by the reductions he proposes? From a cursory consideration of the situation, one concludes that the persons who will benefit are largely importers. The Australian manufacturers have been suffering from a lack of protection, while the importers have been making large profits, yet the latter will benefit more than any other class. hardship being undergone by those who are contributing income tax to-day? So long as the incidence of the tax is fair there should be no complaint, because taxpayers contribute in accordance with the amount they earn. I have shown that the majority of the people pay indirect taxes-al l heads of households pay them -and these have been increased year by year during the Treasurer's term of office. According to the last available report of the Commissioner of Taxes there were 220,000 income taxpayers in the Commonwealth. Their taxable income for the year whicli ended with June, 1925I could not obtain later figuresamounted to £119,000,000. Of those 220,000 taxpayers, 11,000 had taxable income aggregating £57,000,000. That is There not working capital, or money required -to carry on business or industry; it is their taxable income for one year. The average income of each of them, is more than £5,000 per annum. manufacturers. fortunately, too few manufacturers figure conspicuously, in the income tax returns. There are plenty of traders, importers, and merchants, and a certain number of land-owners who do so. It is they who will benefit by the reduction proposed by the Treasurer. taxpayers with taxable incomes of £5,000 a year, and each will get, on the average, a gift of £54 from the Treasurer this year through the reduction of taxation. Men with taxable incomes of £10,000 will get a benefit of £191; those with taxable incomes of £20,000 will get £491; and those with taxable incomes of £50;000, of whom there are quite a large number in the Commonwealth, will be given £1,391 in the very year in which the Treasurer is imposing a heavier burden upon the family man living on the basic wage. These figures indicate the iniquity of the system of taxation applied by the present Government. creasing their income taxation. are; they have been driven to do so by Is dire necessity.

I am trying to ascertain what justification can be found for the Treasurer's proposal to relieve the wealthy classes of taxation before he has made any effort to relieve the general public of the burdens they are carrying. In 1925-26 the general taxpayers were prosperous. come was higher than in the preceding years, and measured by thg banking deposits, tbe financial, commercial, and pastoral sections of the community were doing very well, notwithstanding the droughts in some States. In 1925 bank deposits and peace and war savings certificates in the Oommonwealth amounted to £466,077,000; in 1926 the total was £491,587,000, having increased £25,500,000 in one year. From 1916 until last year the aggregate deposits to the credit of various institutions throughout Australia increased £202,000,000. I know that that sum cannot be accepted as an exact measure of the increase in wealth and production; it is apt to be misleading if so regarded. Allowance must be made for various factors which led to an inflation of bank deposits, but the figures are a broad indication that the general trading community, and the large body of Commonwealth taxpayers are not in such distress that they should get relief in preference to the family man and others who are paying indirect taxation through the Customs. Nor has the Treasurer any justification for proposing to reduce the land tax. M.r.

The Commonwealth land tax is well justified. It was intended to prevent the growth in Australia of that land monopoly which in other countries has become a curse. Land monopoly is. one of the most diflicult by agrarian problems with which older countries have been faced, and the Labour party has wisely endeavoured to prevent it from becoming acute in Australia. by The aim of the party was to break up large estates and return to the community a proportion of the unearned increment of land values created by the community. For the latter reason the tax was made applicable to city as well as country property. A l though the present Treasurer and his party were returned ostensibly to assist the small landowner and working farmer, nearly all his efforts have been in the direction of relieving the wealthy pastoralists and land monopolists.

The average unimproved value of these 20,000 properties is £12,S00. What working farmers own farms of which the unimproved value is £12,800? is the class of estate that pays the Commonwealth land tax. It is not paid by the working farmer who has property of an unimproved value of £1,000, £2,000, or £3,000. are prosperous farmers indeed, if they can be called farmers, who own property of an unimproved value of more than £5,000.

In the course of a decade the unearned increment to their land amounts to millions of pounds, and they are asked to return merely a small modicum, of that community-created wealth. Yet the Treasurer proposes to whittle away this taxation, which is no longer as effective as it was in the early days of its application. M.r. EODOERS -It is not quite so punitive ? tive. It first came into operation in 1911. If it was intended to punish land-owners it is a strange fact that although non-Labour governments have been in office in the Commonwealth since 1916, this allegedly punitive legislation is still on the statute-book. No one who knows the history of the Commonwealth land tax can doubt the bona fides and purity of motive which prompted the Labour party to introduce it. The pity is that it was not continued in its original, effective form. Had that been done it would have led to* a greater subdivision of large estates, and the closer occupation and better utilization of land, and would have given to farmers' sons more opportunities to get holdings for themselves. Many towns in New South Wales are landlocked because large estates adjacent to them are being used for grazing, although suitable for wheat-growing and other forms of agriculture.

The financial policy of the Commonwealth has failed. surer has shown no ability in coping with the problems, though he assumed office as the champion of economy. He has achieved no economy. preached the necessity for an effective tariff, he has not been able to propose one. As a consequence of financial ineptitude on the part of the Government, the taxation now ruling in the Commonwealth is the highest on record. The expenditure this year, from both loan and revenue sources, leaving out war services, is also a record under a Treasurer who promised to practice economy. Imports into Australia for the nnancial year just ended have reached record dimensions, and the adverse trade balance during the last five years is also a disastrous record. These four main essentials to sound finance-economy, equitable taxatiou, a satisfactory trade balance, and a reduction of foreign imports-hav e not been achieved, and the present Government has a more disastrous record than any of its predecessors. The Treasurer must know the position, although he has not dealt with it in his budget. He has failed to give any guidance or explanation to honourable members, and to offer auy policy that will lead to a correction of the evils that undoubtedly exist. Surely honourable members cannot be. blind to the situation. The Treasurer has preached economy to the State Treasurers. He has condemned extravagant expenditure. There is not in Australia, nor has there been for many years, a more unsuccessful Treasurer than the honourable gentleman himself.

Such an argument is a reflection upon the controllers of industry and upon the Government. bility for efficiency in industry must'be chargeable against some one, and an investigation will show that whereas the factor of labour is chargeable with a certain degree of that responsibility, mismanagement, lack of standards, lack of transportation, and lack of proper organization are the principal factors making for inefficiency in Australia and in every other country to-day. I have sufficient faith in the Australian man, whether worker or supervisor, to say that he can do as well as his competitors elsewhere in the matter of conducting business and producing the commodities that we require in this country. I hope that before long we shall institute a real protective policy. Our present policy is ineffective, is producing a load of taxation, and is not saving Australian industry. Those are the chief problems facing Australia. The motion of tbe Leader of the Opposition is justified, and every real Australian in this chamber must endorse it. orable members have listened to a long lecture by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), dealing principally -with the shortcomings of the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page). The honourable member has had a long experience of financial matters; but it will not be denied that, when he was Treasurer and Premier of Queensland for some ten years, the public debt of that State increased from £56,869,000 to £97,000,000. ber knows that, during my regime, the increase in the public debt was less' in Queensland than in any other State of the Commonwealth. bers were treated to a lecture by the honourable member for Dalley, they will ministration while he was Treasurer .of",27,Budget 1927 28

153,Mr Mackay,"I think I am justifiedbewildering. I have some figures bere whicb I think put the case in a nutshell, so far as debt redemption is concerned. Between 1922, when the Bruce-Page Government assumed ofiice, and the present time, the Oommonwealth debt has been reduced by £36,188,464. It is a fact that loans to the amount of £3S,000,000 have been raised in the meantime for Commonwealth purposes, but I ask honourable members to consider what the money was borrowed for. It was borrowed for reproductive post office deveincrease has been made, however, a delopmental and other Commonwealth works. honourable members on both sides arguing with the Postmaster-General about the necessity of providing better facilities for country districts. Por postal and developmental purposes, sums totalling £35,936,357 were raised, and, in addition, the sum of £2,024,022 was raised for the Federal Capital Commission. Will any honourable member say that this expenditure was not necessaiy, or member for Dalley spoke. that the borrowing was not soundly conducted so far as the sinking fund scheme is concerned? As honourable members know, there is a 10s. per cent, sinking fund for Commonwealth loans on a 50-yea.rs period, and provision has been made to wipe out these debts within a certain time. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) attempted to make capital out of the fact that the public debt, at the present time, is higher, in spite of debt reductions, to the extent of £2,000,000, than when the present Government assumed ofiice. fectly clear to any one who studies the papers that this is so, but if there had been a Labour Government in ofiice, it ini^ht have squandered that £36,188,464 and instead of the public debt being only £2,000,000 more than in 1922, it might have been £38,000,000 more. That has been the experience of every State of the Commonwealth governed by Labour. At the present time we have four States under Labour administration. Does any honourable member suggest for a moment that taxation is being reduced, or borrowing curtailed, in those States? The Leader of the Opposition had much to say on the fact that the trade balance is against tbe Commonwealth at the present time. There is nothing new in that. We are all, unfortunately, aware of the fact; but the honourable member for Dalley goes a step further, and says it is the consesequence of heavy Commonwealth taxation. The explanation, of course, is that we buy . more from overseas than we export from Australia. As a nation we are not producing enough. It is true that the tariff is designed to help local industry, and from time to time this House is asked to increase the duty on various items. Every time, an mand has followed for better conditions of How often do we hear labour, higher wages, or a shorter working week. The result is that the cost of production, instead of being reduced, is increasing all the time, and for that reason the people have to pay more for their goods. It is impossible for our secondary industries to manufacture for export for the reason that the cost of production is too high. That is undoubtedly the reason for the adverse trade balance of which the honourable It is unreasonable to suppose that we can go on in this way. We are now producing less, under better conditions, that we were producing some years' ago, and the remedy, it appears to me, is to decrease working costs. Various suggestions have been made to this end. The Government recently asked representative men from the trade unions and from the employers to visit America, and to learn what might be of benefit to industry in Australia. Those gentlemen have now returned, and it -is regrettable that their It is perreport is not unanimous. Any suggestion that is made in Australia for the introduction of piece-work, profit-sharing, copartnership, or payment by results, immediately brings ]3rotests from the Trades Hall. The other night, when I was speaking on another matter, I referred to the fact that there was a great deal of unemployment throughout Australia, necessitating large sums of money being paid in the form of doles, without any return to industry. Recently in Queensland, when the railway unions went before the Board of Trade for an increase in wages, it was refused, and the board's reply is reported as follows:In refusing the claim of the Queensland railway workers for an increased basic wage, the Arbitration Court intimated that the Queensland tradesmen's claim for an additional wage that represented tlie value of his work over unemployment. The CommonAvealth Goand above that of the labourer, might be conceded under the system of payment by results, based on the individual or group output, and with adequate protection against progressive rate-cuttinp and excessive labour, and for the right and opportunity of collective bargaining. \Yith this correction, there should be no valid objection to a trial of piecework on a large scale. operation for a number of years in the moulders' section at the Ipswich railway workshop, and the court urged the Commissioner and the unions to come together with a view to its extension to other sections of the workshop, on conditions that would safeguard the proper interests of the employers, and thus secure them the f u l l result of their industry. ber for Dalley, tbose reductions must, of The court declined to grant preference to any particular union, but agreed to allow the Commissioner to make his own terms with each organization. That gets right down to bed-rock, and it appears that, although this board was appointed by a Labour government,' and its personnel have pronounced Labour mack has done-that tbe country cannot go on under present conditions. suggestion it makes is very timely, and I would be glad to see honourable members on the other side take more interest , in the matter, and try to work in with capital, so that we might get better results all round. Under a system of piecework full protection can be guaranteed for those men who are genuinely unable to compete on equal terms with their fellows; but it is a fatal mistake to handicap the good man, and keep him down to the level of the less efficient man. The Leader of the Opposition has not made out a good case for his amendment. I cannot agree with the honourable member for Dalley that the tariff should be raised, if necessary, to 100 per cent. It is not wise to increase the duties too high. The object of duties is defeated when, as at present, the trade unions immediately demand increased wages and shorter hours. I am just as jealous of the rights and privileges of the working man as is any other honourable member, but I deprecate the use of methods which encourage class hatred, and the endeavours of extremists to induce unionists to agitate for higher -wages and shorter hours when it* is impracticable to grant them. Those methods are not in the best interests of the Avorkers of Australia. The high taxation prevalent in our States Mr Mackay. is largely responsible for tbe existing vernment has made strenuous endeavours to reduce taxation, and cannot be held to be in any Avay responsible for our unemployment. It has increased the exemption from £100 to '£300, and the deduction for the maintenance of children from The system of piecework had been in £26 to £50. In 1923 it reduced the incidence of taxation by 10 per ,-ent.; in 1924-25, . by 10 per cent.; in 192627, by 13 per cent.; and in 19272S, by 10 per. cent. Despite the remarks of the honourable memnecessity, be beneficial to the worker. It is impossible for industries to expand in most of our States because of the high taxation. Quite a number of people who haA'e from £2,000 to £3,000 available for investment prefer to place their money in gilt-edged securities, such as CommonAvealth loans, instead of in industry, mainly because of the preAalence of inr dustrial trouble. It is all nonsense to The say that our unemployment is due to the excessive arrival of migrants in Australia. The number of unemployed in Queensland aloneis greater than all the migrants that arrived in Australia last year. I long to see the establishment of a better understanding betAveen capital and labour, so that all concerned may reap adequate reAvard for their labour and hwestments. Honourable members opposite, regardless of the result, are keen to see the realization of that plank of their platform which requires the nationalization of the means of production, distribution, and exchange. The honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) said, the other nightWe have lost on our steamers, as we have ou other state instrumentalities: and when Labour is in poAveri t will continue, if necessary, to lose on them. Such a policy would accentuate existing difficulties. It is ridiculous to contend that Ave can spend 25s. if \ve haA'e only £1. The Treasurer is to be complimented on the presentation of his first budget speech in the permanent home of the CommonAvealth Parliament.

Undoubtedly the repeal of the Surplus Revenue Act, in April last, in defiance of the opinions of many prominent members of this chamber,'has proved to be very welcome, and is largely responsible for bringing about a permanent solution of the problem. drastic alteration since April. Government has been generous to the States to a degree that was not originally intended.

I am pleased that the Government has set aside £200,000 as the nucleus of a fund to establish a scheme of national insurance, and I sincerely hope that the measure will be introduced this session. sort of a scheme of national insurance is imperative, I refer to the extensive work performed by our charitable institutions. Last year 150,000 adults and children received outdeor relief throughout Australia, to the extent of £2,539,000. further £4,000,000 was expended on the upkeep of general and mental hospitals. If we add to that amount the cost of old-age and invalid pensions, £9,000,000, we find that a total of £15,000,000 was expended on charitable relief work throughout Australia last year be included in this scheme? the proposals of the Government will be. Undoubtedly the various institutions provide a certain amount of relief, but it is desirable that the Commonwealth a should evolve a more adequate scheme to assist those suffering from sickness ancl unemployment.. The Government has given complete evidence that it is desirous of doing the fair thing by every section of the community. It will be election, the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) said that so long as he was leader of the National party he would not represent any particular section of the community, but would legislate for the people as a whole. There are two sections with which the Government is anxious to deal. One is the conservative who desires to exploit the labourer by paying low wages and enforcing long hours, and the other is the communist, who endeavours to stir up industrial strife and class hatred and foment strikes ancl direct action. I rose Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton). Had the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) not spoken, I probably should not have digressed by reading newspaper extracts, a practice which I deprecate.

The honourable member tried to make a considerable amount of political capital out of the statement that the Queensland national debt was so much greater uncler a Labour than under a National Government, taken over a number of years. He accused the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), who was for a long time Premier ancl Treasurer of Queensland, of having indulged in a reckless financial policy.' The debt of Queensland for the period 1915-1925, under Labour administration, shows an increase proportionately less than the increase in the debt of any other State, ancl certainly less than that of the Commonwealth. The following are the percentage increases of the public debt of rhe different States for the period heard any of them say that they suffered 1915-25 :l er cent. J Queensland New South Wales .. OS Victoria South Australia Western Australia For the greater portion of that period New South Wales was under a National Government. Labour being in power only for four years of the term. Those figures entirely discount tbe statements of the lionorable member. A consideration of the rate of interest payable on the public debt of the various States reflects the greatest, credit upon Labour's administraganization which battened upon class tion in Queensland. When the Labour party assumed office in that State in 19.15 members opposite are connected. The Gothe rate of interest on the public debt there was the highest in the Commonwealth; but ten years later it was the lowest. When we remember that, and at the same time bear-in mind that the public debt of that State increased less proportionately during the same term than the public debt of any other State, we have a complete vindication of Labour's rule. The oversea reputation of Queensland is higher than that of any other State. The honourable member for Lilley read a number of extracts from articles which have appeared at various tinies in what I must assume to be biased newspapers, and he reiterated certain parrot cries in which the words "" shorter hours "" and "" higher pay "" occurred with monotonous regularity. The honourable member does not appear to know that captains of industry in other countries have deliberately shortened the working hours of their employees and paid higher wages because experience has shown them that the results are increased output, a better organization, and more efficient workmen. This action has been taken in spite of the fact that other employees in the same neighbourhood have carried on under the old conditions. Nor does the honourable member seem to be aware that when the Fuller Government came into power in New South Wales in 1922 and repealed the 44-hour week legislation passed by the preceding Labour Government, and re-instituted the 48-hour week, many manufacturers refused to take advantage of the measure. I have never loss through it. . It appears as though some honourable members opposite would be quite willing to introduce the Japanese .. 55.64 barrack system to Australian industrial .. 75 life. In Japan children are brought into .. 85 the cities and herded in barracks adjacent .. 74 to the factories iu which they are to work, and they spend twelve hours in the barracks and twelve hours in the factory, year in and year out. The barrack beds are never cold. Is it suggested that we should adopt those methods in Australia in order to compete with Japan? The honourable member also referred to class hatred. If ever there was a political orhatred it is that with which honourable vernment which they support is in office to-day mainly because it aroused class hatred during the last election campaign. The prostitution of the instrumentalities of government of which this Government has been guilty is more calculated to cause revolution in this country than the warmest advocacy of any of the reforms in which honourable members on this side of the chamber are interested. member regard Communism as a reform? conduct of the supporters of this Government is bringing our present methods of constitutional government into serious disrepute with the people, and when",32,Budget 1927 28

The history of the world shows that whenever class-conscious effete aristocracies have become corroded by over-indulgence and greed the mass of the people rise up and overwhelm them. This Government, even in the last week or two, has acted in such a way that it may expect the people at the first opportunity to overduties. Every morning seven or eight whelm it. The debate upon which we are engaged can only, like most similar debates, have the effect of further condemning the methods of finance which this Government seems determined to follow. ""We have already heard a good deal from honourable members about the adverse balance of trade and the financial stringency from which the country is suffering: but we have heard only about effects. The Treasurer set the example in his speech of entirely overlooking the causes sf our present difficulties. Until we clearly recognize these causes we cannot expect to remedy them. Honourable members opposite seem determined to hug the present financial system until it absolutely collapses. They are afraid to clo anything unless they have some precedent for it. In my opinion we must find a new; method of financing the affairs of our country, or our civilization, like many that have preceded it, will crumble and disappear. We hear a good deal in these days about our national debt. National debts have been caused by the operations of private banking companies, and the longer we allow them to accumulate the more complete must be our ultimate collapse. We laid the foundations for building up huge public debts when we handed' over the currency of our country to private financial institutions ancl permitted them to usurp the prerogatives of government. Our financial burdens will continue to grow until we resume control of the currency. There must come a day of reckoning, and the sooner we anticipate it and prepare for it, the better it will be for us. We heard a good deal last'night about the cost of production, and the cost of living, but the criticism of honourable members opposite, who had so much to say on the subject, was far from constructive. methods of production and distribution are wasteful in the extreme. Every morning one may see in, say, the suburb of Canterbury, in Sydney, hundreds of men rushing from, their homes at 6 o'clock in the morning to catch trains, trams or buses, to get to Balmain to start work at the appoir.ted hour; while at Balmain probably just as many men begin at the same hour to rush to Canterbury, so that they may reach it in time to begin their milk carts may be seen delivering milk in the little street in DulwichH ill where I live. Other perishable commodities are distributed in the same wasteful manner. While we are talking about finding markets abroad for our products, many of our own people are obliged to do without them because our methods of distribution make them far too costly. The dairyman, for instance, gets only about 25 per cent, of the value of his milk, while the consumer has to pay twice as much as it is worth. should bear in mind that for five of the last ten years the affairs of New South Wales have been administered by Labour governments. which I am referring are practically world-wide. But in reply to the honourable member's interjection, let me say that Labour governments have not beeu able in five short years to overcome the effects of 50 years of mal-administration by anti-Labour governments. As a matter of fact, the Lang Government was about to wrestle with the problem of milk when it was superseded. What honourable member would think of allowing five or six postmen from rival post oifices to deliver letters in the same street? If that were permitted our postage rate for ordinary letters would be Is. instead jpf l^d. each. Private enterprise has altogether failed to justify itself. The economic waste due to private enterprise will never be eliminated under the present anarchic system of capitalism.

Beyond doubt England. Sir Ernest Harvey said that this system of finance, which we call the banking of Australia was carried on capitalism, is hopelessly bankrupt, and differently from that of Great Britain. the Treasurer and his supporters, in seekInstead of the overdraft operating in ing to stave off the day of reckoning, are Australia, the bill market operated in attempting the impossible.

I shall mention one illustration of how this wonderful system operates when the money jugglers of the world apply it to their own uses. Some years ago, over a period of weeks, a group of American financiers drew from the Bank of England amounts n gold aggregating ; £11,000,000, and shipped the money to New York. Prior to that these gamblers sold British securities heavily, and bought' American bonds and shares. The transfer of £11,000,000 worth .;f gold to America caused aheavy fall in 325 British representative securities, equivalent to £115,000,000, while the absorption of gold in America caused a corresponding rise iu the securities of that country. It was computed that at the time of this operation the actual wealth of Great Britain was £20,000,000,000. Yet a few men, whoj lily-wise, "" toil not, neither do they spin,"" by taking £11,000,000 worth of gold from a country whose wealth amounted to £20,000,000,000, caused a tremendous trade depression, a depreciation of the stocks of one country, and an appreciation of thos-. of another country, 1 and raked off millions of pounds in the process. Subsequent ,}"", having bought up 1 the depreciated British stocks, they returned the gold to England and raked in an additional profit through the consequent appreciation f.f values. If that £11,000,000 .had benn sent to America in the form of goods, there would have been more work for the employees in the factory, more money spent on wages, and a general buoyancy in British trade. In stead, depression and dislocation were caused by the machinations of a few men who were financially immoral, and a greater menace to the world than were the buccaneers and pirates of old. A pirate or bushranger at least takes his life in his hand; but a financial manipulator, hiding behind legal intricacies, is able to rob the people. His operations are more detrimental and far-reaching than the depredations of pirates and bushrangers. One would have thought that Great Britain would take steps to stop this practice, since it has been detrimental to her export trade; but she has lain dormant. The banker is the medicine man of finance, and he is left untouched; simply because he instils in the people a superstition .for this thing called gold greater and more potent than the superstition of the most abandoned savage for his sticks and stones and false gods. The banker gets his "" rake-off"" from every country in the world. The result frequently has been trade wars and the dislocation of the world's affairs. Some people are under the impression that gold as international currency is old established, but it was unknown before 1870 as a basis of value for international trade. I want this country to develop as Britain developed during her industrial period, but not under similar conditions. At that time the policy of laisser faire opeiated, and, as Adam Smith said in his book, Political Economy, no political party dared to interfere with private enterprise. In ' all countries at that time sweated labour conditions were rife. Prom 1844 to 1S70 Great Britain had a phenomenal growth of industries, and at the end of that period her export trade' had increased nearly S00 ner cent. She had a national currency which had no reflection elsewhere, and could not be depreciated or interfered with by any other country. With the exception of Prance, Great Britain was the only country in the world at that time that had gold currency. Prance had adopted the system of bimetallism; but as she manufactured only luxuries there was little or no international effect. Then the picture changed, and a rush for European markets and a struggle for trade and cominevce ensued. In 1872 Bismarck demanded.an indemnity from Prance of £400,000,000 in gold. Germany established a gold basis of currency, and other countries followed suit. Gold thus became an international factor. The one man in England who had the mentality to foresee the effect upon Great Britain was Cecil Balfour Phipson. In his book, The Redemption of Labour and The Science of Civilization, he showed that unless Great Britain changed its policy its industries would languish. Prior to 1872 Germany, America, and other countries sent their primary products to Great Britain and received manufactured articles in ""xchange, Those countries had a silver currency, and were therefore not wealthy enough to compete with Great Britain in manufacturing. At that time Germany was backward in industries, simply because Great Britain had outdistanced her. Gold in Germany was more valuable than in Great Britain. It is an economi.cal truism that money is more valuable i-i a poor country than in a rich country, its purchasing power is greater, instead of Germany receiving manufactured articles in return for her beet sugar and other products sent to Great Britain, she claimed gold from the Bank of England and utilized it as desired. Then came the operation of the bill market, and, as the gold was withdrawn, the bauk rate increased. other couutries refused to take the manufactures^ of Great Britain, in return for their products, and that, in addition, the operation of the bill market, stifled to n large extent the industrial activities of Great Britain. Germany, as a consequence, had a period of phenomenal growth, while Great Britain's progress was relatively less. The American and Canadian farmers sent their products to Great Britain, and claimed on the Bank of England for gold. In most countries of Europe, where sweated labour conditions prevail, currency has depreciated. Our currency is more valuable, and, therefore, those countries send their goods here, and instead of making a profit of from 10 per cent, to 30 per cent., they make from 100 per cent, to 300 per cent. In Germany our currency is worth five times its Australian value. Assuming that in Japan our currency is worth five times its Australian value, a Japanese merchant who sells goods here at £100 would receive in return currencj' valued at £500 in Japan. That position operated up to the time of the war. Couut Ashati, a Japanese economist, said that, as far back as 1908, one sovereign in Japan was worth five sovereigns in England. arrive their value is increased five-fold. when our currency is sent to Japan, its value is increased to the same extent. It is impossible to frame a protectionist tariff to meet that position. In 1908 a sovereign was worth £6 10s. in Japan, and as a result of the war its value has [56] increased. We are handicapped to that extent when we attempt to compete with that and other countries. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) recognized this when he was a private member. He said that it was absolutely impossible for this country to have a proper protective tariff, and that borrowing abroad must cease. The Treasurer replied that borrowing abroad would not cease. Twenty-four hours later, the honourable member became Minister for Trade and Customs, and swallowed the whole of his criticism of the Government's borrowing policy A few months ago a merchant and The manufacturer told me that he had to ship 1,000 bales of Australian raw material over to Liverpool and bring it back again before he could obtain finance, because the private banks in this country refused to extend him further accommodation. While the assets of this country are twice what they were a few years ago, the extent of the accommodation granted to traders remains the same. It is all planned for the purpose of allowing that "" medicine man"" of finance-the banker-to put the "" dope "" over the public in just the same way, only more effectively, that the medicine man of the tribe puts it over the ignorant savage. The whole thing is well thought out and arranged for the purpose of keeping the people clinging with the superstitition of savages, to this thing called gold. Surely the profits, perquisites, and privileges given to private banking institutions by this Goveniment, and' the privileges which they have enjoyed in this and every other country in the past, have been great enough without giving them more. The private banks have been allowed to usurp the prerogative of government, and between the years 1901and 1925 they took f u l l advantage of the liberty allowed to them. In 3901 the legal currency in possession of the banks amounted altogether to £18,581,600. The banks expanded credit to tbe amount of £93,701,100 by issuing counterfeit cheque pounds to the extent of over £75,000,000. This process of counterfeit coining increased every year until in 1925, the last year for which I have the figures, the banks, with legal currency amounting to £45,779,623, expanded credit to the extent of",34,Budget 1927 28

166,Mr Lazzarini,"That is so, and£197,450.902, and the issue of counterfeit cheque pounds amounted to £151,671,270. Cheque pounds to-day comprise 90 per cent, of the paper currency of the nation, and 95 per cent, of this currency is spurious and base. It is as spurious as any counterfeit £5 note ever issued by a criminal, but the criminal is put into gaol, there are not 40,000,000 sovereigns to while the banker is called a patriot, and is given the highest titles in the land. The system is neither more nor less than a legalized form of counterfeiting. For every £3. the banks hold, even on current account, they lend out 17s. at 6 or 7 per cent, interest, some of the money being on short-dated loans, and some on longer loans. This money is used principally by the farmers and primary producers, and is obtained by them in the form of overdrafts to carry them, pending the marketing of their produce. When the private banks fall short of till money, all they have to do is to apply to the Commonwealth Bank, from which they can obtain ns many notes as tbey require at 5 per cent, interest, and they only pay interest for the period they actually hold tbe notes.' That is what this paternal Government has done for the private banks. While I hold no brief for any of these institutions, and regard them all as either glorified pawnshops or counterfeit coiners, I must point out that there is one bank--the Bank of New South Waleswhicb is allowed to have a private arrangement with the Commonwealth Bauk whereby it can obtain up to the £300,000 or £400,000 accommodation at '3 per cent., while all the other banks have to pay 5 per cent. I do not know why this is. I have asked the Treasurer about it, but all he will tell me is that he does not know, and that it is not his business. I ask him now does he think it rignx tnat the resources of this nation should be used to allow bankers to over-trade, to lend out 17s. for every £1 they hold on current account at 6 or 7 per cent, interest, and then to obtain till money from the Commonwealth Bank at 5 per cent, interest. The financial position of this country will never improve until the nation pools its resources by the complete national control of finance and credit, and until it takes back from the private banks the power they have usurped'of issuing currency. The currency needs of' the people are reflected Mr Laesarini. very often in prices, and while it might be said by some that the gold basis still exists, it is a fact that as far as currency is concerned, gold has played no effective part for 50 years. In Australia there are claims against gold amounting to £700,000,000, and meet it. The Government refuses to issue sufficient currency for the needs of the people, so that trade is restricted, and a huge currency vacuum is created which is filled by .counterfeit coining and cheque pounds issued by tbe private banks. Whether it is a £1 note or a cheque or any other form of money, tbe thing that affects economic exchange in a country is currency, and it has been tbe prerogative of all governments, despotic and otherwise, to issue the nation's currency. The banks to-day have usurped that power by the issue, of cheque pounds. Every £1 that is created by overdraft or otherwise is currency. The banks have no right to do this, and they are counterfeiters pure and simple. I will be satisfied with nothing less than the elimination of this criminal practice from tlie commercial-and financial life of Australia. I will be satisfied only with complete national control of the whole finance and credit system of the country, and the carrying on of all banking arrangements by the Government. In other words, I want to see the bank the nation, and the nation the bank. member's party advocate that? stood on the public platform and advocated it. ber does. ber is the only one who talks about it. member thinks he knows so much about the subject, I invite him to meet me on the public platform to debate it.

Honourable members opposite talk about the need for producing more, about reducing wages, about black labour, and longer hours. Their party has had all that in the past. In Europe to-day, and by EuropeI mean Britain also, they are getting back to the system of doles, which was in operation 100 years ago. The condition of affairs there must arouse feelployment.

A few days ago the Treasurer stated that Australia was under a considerable debt of gratitude to Great Britain for providing it with £34,000,000 to assist migration. That £34,000,000, like the rest ""of our borrowing abroad, must come here in the form of British goods, to be consumed by Australians, to the detriment of our artisans, who will be put out of employment by the transaction. The Treasurer scrupulously follows tbe policy of his party, which had even its cruisers built abroad. It imports the migrant, and exports his job. I shall never vote to bring another migrant here while our own people are land-hungry and unable to secure emexperienced farmers, who have successcannot obtain suitable holdings for themselves. They have approached me repeatedly, ancl stated, "" Give us half the advantages that you give to the immigrant, and we will make a success ""of things."" adequately catered for by the State Governments. monwealth nor the State Governments cater for them.

Probably it is the intention of can analyze without seeing this Government to unload on the migrants land such as was passed on to our soldier settlers, land which would be refused by any practical farmer. After the war, estates which would not bring £2 or £3 per acre were purchased by the Commonwealth Eepatriation Department for £6 ancl £7 an acre, and unloaded on our unfortuate returned soldiers, who, naturally, could not make good in.such circumstances. There is more behind the scheme than a mere desire to place more men on the .land. We have heard a good deal about protecting our industries, but this Government has made no adequate attempt to deal with the fiscal question in Australia.

Our customs duties are increasing too rapidly. "" I support, particularly, that part of the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, to the effect that insufficient protection is granted to our Australian industries, and I agree, to some extent, with the honourable member for Dalley. We should prohibit the importation of many commodities. If I go into a tobacconist, shop in Sydney and buy tobacco, in most cases I am given a box of matches with the tobacco. Eight out of ten of those shops hand me imported matches. easily overcome that, but they will not supply -except to certain firms. I prosecuted that inquiry very thoroughly. my grocer to supply me with Australian matches, but he invariably brings foreign matches, which I return. Those foreign matches sell at 8d. per dozen, while Australian matches sell at ojd. to 6d. a dozen, yet the imported and higher, priced article is forced on the people. I have inspected the Melbourne factory of Messrs. Bryant and May, and consider theirs to be a wonderful industry. I would go further than the honourable member for Dalley. I would not merely put a stone wall protection around Australia so far as matches are concerned, but I would have destroyers patrolling our coasts, and would shoot anybody who attempted to bring in foreign matches. less than complete prohibition is useless where we can supply the requirements of our people. I consider a revenue tariff to impose the most immoral kind of taxation in existence. It is the policy of a cowardly Government and Treasurer, who are afraid to disclose the origin of the Government's revenue, and seek to bring it in through the back door. I do not apply that remark to any specific Treasurer. It has been my life-long conviction. I support the amendment. I hope that it will be carried, and that, as a result, this Government will go thoroughly into its financial and' other sins of the past, and endeavour to formulate a sound financial policy, which will be permanent. I shall conclude my speech by reading the amendment, so that it may be well impressed on the minds of honourable members. It is an excellent one, which must commend itself to this Parliament, and it certainly will commend itself to the country. It readsThat the item be reduced by f l , in order to draw attention to our adverse trade balance, the inadequacy of the protection afforded to Australian industries, and the increase of unemployment, and to direct the Government to remodel its financial policy to bring it into accord with the economic necessities of the Commonwealth. congratulate the Treasurer on the form of his budget. It is admirably brief, clear, and easy to understand. I am in complere agreement with many of the individual actions of the Treasurer in the past. He has a remarkable record in that respect. But beyond that I cannot go. To my great personal regret I find myself in almost complete disagreement with the honourable gentleman in regard to his management of the Commonwealth finances. Indeed, his appreciation and mine of the present political and economic position of Australia are as wide apart as the poles. There runs through the budget speech, as well as other speeches which he has delivered of late, great cheerfulness respecting our existing conditions and a complete optimism as to the future. I may be entirely wrong in my financial diagnosis, but I take a somewhat gloomy, or at least serious view, of the position, and in that I do not differ from many thoughtful and responAnything sible people who are engaged in the business affairs of this country. The grounds upon which I base my opinion of the situation are briefly these. We found ourselves, after thewar, so heavily burdened with debt and taxation that, even under easy and simple economic conditions, our future would have been at least a little obscure, and our progress restricted. But our economic conditions were neither simple nor easy. Indeed, they were very remarkable. Almost every month we found Australian industry as a whole becoming less self-supporting, and",40,Treasury Notice

178,Mr Gullett (Henty) [5.59],"Ithe position has gradually become worse, until to-day all our secondary industries need, and are receiving, artificial aid. That perhaps is not, in itself, surprising; but what is surprising and disquieting is the growth ancl necessity of the practice of giving support to our primary industries. Already the -whole of our tropical ancl sub-tropical primary industries are artificially supported. The primary industries in our irrigation areas are also being assisted in the same way; and even primary industries in the normal rainfall areas are one after another becoming so sickly that they are asking this Parliament to help them. It is clear that the money required to sup-, port these industries can be obtained from only two or three sources. As I see the position, *t.he assistance is being drawn from the few remaining industries that are still self-supporting, and from borrowed money. Wool and wheat and loans are at present carrying the Australian industries remaining. This is a precarious situation indeed, and justifies one in regarding the outlook with gravity. It is highly dangerous, for this country as a whole, and for so many of its industries in particular, to be dependent upon two main primary industries; for, after all, there is nothing certain in the production of either wool or wheat, or in the prices which we can obtain for those commodities. We cannot look with any confidence even two or three seasons ahead. dustries are extremely susceptible to seasonal influences, and we kjnow from sad for both commodities vary greatly. I should like for a few minutes to speculate as to why it is that one after another of our great industries has weakened until it has needed artificial assistance. The explanation is simple. It is because of the abnormal prices which prevail in this country for the fundamental necessities of industry. Take capital. Australia is paying more for its money than any other country within the British Empire, and more than the great majority of countries throughout the world. Take labour. I say, without hesitation, that owing to our short working week and our resistance to the piece-work system, we are paying more for labour than any other country in the world. If we take such essentials to industry as coal, cement, steel, petrol, and the like, we find that, although industry is to a large extent dependent upon these basic commodities, prices for tbem are higher in Australia than anywhere else. It is because of these facts that I regard our present economic position as serious. Let us look now for a moment at the activities of the Commonwealth Government in respect to the situation. What is the Treasurer doing to meet it? What financial policy is he pursuing; and what is likely to be the effect of that policy iu the immediate present, ancl in the few years just ahead of us? I say, quite definitely, that his policy is not helpful. Surelyi f there is one policy which the Government and the country requires today more than another it is a policy of taxation and administration which will leave in the hands of industries which are already hampered and restricted the maximum amount of capital ancl income. But, unfortunately, the Treasurer, during the whole of his four years of office, has year after year taken from industry far more than he should have taken, and spent the money on non-productive undertakings. Let us compare the policy which he pursued after the termination of the war with that which one of the greatest men of all time pursued immediately after Both in the close of the American Civil War. Abraham Lincoln was urged by his treasurer to undertake an extensive developexperience that prices mental policy, and to increase taxation to enable it to be carried out; but he resolutely refused to do so. He pointed out that the country had just emerged from a terrible struggle, stricken, bleeding, and almost exhausted. "" Give it a breathing space,"" he said, ""to bind up its wounds and recover its exhausted energies. This is not the moment to impose fresh burdens upon it."" I wish that our Treasurer had, from the moment he assumed ofiice, followed the illustrious example of Abraham Lincoln. The policy which the honourable gentleman has pursued is the more disappointing to me because of thc remarkable series of speeches iwhich he delivered in this Parliament a few years ago when he was a private inember, and to which he owes Knowing the seasonal uncertainties, and his Cabinet rank to-day. He literally the variations in prices that have ocstormed his way into his present position. curred in my lifetime, and will, no doubt, He relentlessly attacked the previous Gobe experienced again, in the wool and vernment, and if it had not been for the wheat industries, those two supports canway in which, in those days, he made his not be regarded as irremovable.

183,Mr Gullett,"I suggest the appliof this country by £9,000,000. I admit at once that the totality of taxation was almost inevitable, because of conversion loans at increasing rates of interest, the necessity for a policy of development in a young country, to which I entirely subscribe, and the growing cost of repatriation. But, by reason of the growth of population, the honourable gentleman had a considerable margin on which to work, and, therefore, I base my opinion as to his non-success as a Treasurer upon what he has done in the way of per capita taxation. He might have reduced, and had he lived up to his protestations, he must have reduced, our taxation But here is his record. clear nnancial year that ended June, 1924, he did reduce it.

My present task is the most distasteful that a member on this side the cliamber could undertake. ought to be ashamed of his remarks. ber knows that everything I have said is stone-cold truth. He is well aware how unstable the seasons are for wool and wheat, and that the prices of these commodities are not absolutely fixed, as by divine law. A great deal has been said from time to time about the extravagance of the States. My desire is to emphasize the importance of the opportunity now presented to the CommonAvealth as set an example to the States in sound finance. We have a Loan Council. But what an influence is therein, exerted by the Commonwealth when it brings forward, year after year, a policy of extravagant expenditure and increased taxation ! What becomes of the whole case against the States when the Common^ wealth itself is extravagant? I maintain that the action of the Treaper head of population. surer is a direct incentive to extravaFor the first gance on the part of not only the States, but also every family and class in the country. We charge the States The with extravagance. Their taxation in the past four years has been increased by £8,000,000, but tbe Commonwealtli taxation has increased by £900,000 a year. Why, then, hold the States up to scorn as the bad boys of tbe Australian family? We are the spendthrifts, and, so long as Ave pursue this policy, Ave can expect nothing different from the States. I have spoken plainly. I represent, by accident, by a feAv thousapds, more Australians than any other honourable member; mine is a Nationalist constituency, and for my strong criticism of the Treasurer, I am prepared to answer to my constituents. If I go out cheerfully. I now come to the consideration of the agency employed by the Treasurer in raising taxes. It Avas referred to this afternoon by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore). With a good deal said by him, I am in agreement, but on A-ital points I am absolutely at A^ariance Avith him. I agree with the honourable member that the Treasurer, by piling up indirect taxation and substantially reducing direct taxation-th c only scientific and common sense form of taxation-ha s pursued a policy that is inimical to the majority of the Australian people and the interest of our nation, and particularly to the primary producers whom he represents in this House. need not bother about them.",43,Treasury Notice

188,Mr Abbott.^The Honourable Member,"with the honourable member's opinions; I am endeavouring to state the case for the nation, and am not merely pleading for a few squatters. The Treasurer's claim that he has reduced taxation since he has been in office is one of the most fantastic ever made in any Parliament. It is true that he bas reduced taxation of a particular kind-that he has collected less direct taxation from certain classes in the country-bu t at the same time, he has steadily increased the flow of money into the Treasury and has actually collected more both in the aggregate and from each individual taxpayer. He has merely shifted the load on income from the top to' the bottom, and has not actually relieved those people whom he has sought to help by the remis'sion of direct taxation. He has reduced the income collections by a few million pounds, but he has increased indirect taxation through Customs and Excise by almost £1,000,000 a month. I shall endeavour to explain how vicious is the effect upon industry of that change, and how progress is retarded when direct taxation is removed from the top, and a corresponding or greater amount of indirect taxation is collected at the bottom. The money collected at the top is clear profit; it is out iu the open. Much of our taxation to-day is a legacy from the war, the winning of which meant more to some people than to others. It meant infinitely more to the rich than to the poor. Had Germany won the war and been able to collect reparations from us and impose other exacting conditions which the Allies were not able to impose on her, the burden would not have been felt very much by the labourer, tbe artisan, the salaried man, or even the professional; but the millionaire and the men with £10,000 a year or £5,000 a year would have been very hard hit indeed. Therefore, it was for the rich more than for any other class that the war was fought. them. I have never been able to say as good a thing as that. effects of an unsuccessful war the rich man would have been the greatest sufferer. have suffered. ' We would have been treated like dogs. have suffered to the same extent. The working man might have been treated like a dog by his conqueror, but the rich man, in addition to being so treated, would have been dispossessed of his money. Because he had so much more at stake, the rich man should continue to contribute heavily to the cost of the war. I have been endeavouring to show that by remitting direct taxation the man at the top of the scale is nor, being relieved as the Treasurer alleges, but is being penalized. When 10 per cent, of direct taxation is shifted from the top, and a corresonding amount of indirect taxation is applied at the bottom, necessaries, of life become dearer, the cost of living rises, wages advance in sympathy, the cost of production increases, output is reduced, and profits become correspondingly less. So, in the long run, the man who saves 10 per cent, by a remission of income taxation loses more in indirect taxation by reason of the extra cost of living aud reduced turnover. Moreover, as the Commonwealth remits income taxation, the States promptly impose it. Any thing that the Commonwealth drops the States pick up. The Treasurer proposes this year to remit 10 per cent, of income taxation. The State Parliaments will say, "" Well, these fellows paid that 10 per cent, to the Commonwealth Treasurer last year; why should they not pay it to us this year?"" As fast as the Commonwealth loosens the tether, the States take up the slack, and the man at the end of the rope is never a whit freer. The honourable member for-' Dalley( Mr Theodore) said that the indirect taxation falls upon the basic wnjje worker. I deny that. sumers. and by necessaries of life, but the basic wage worker is paid a wage which varies according to the cost of living as shown by Mr Wickens's index figures, and he passes on the extra burden. basic wage adjusted?",44,Treasury Notice

196,Mr Theodore,"Ho w often is the honorable member that that is the weak feature of the system. The Commonwealth is engaging in indirect taxation to a greater extent than any other country in the world. Of a total revenue of approximately £60,000,000 about £45,000,000 is raised by indirect taxation. This taxation is one of the main causes of industrial unrest and class dissension, for although the basic wage is adjusted to meet the cost of living, the adjustment is always so belated that tbe worker is discontented and wondering why, when the average adult wage has risen since 1911 from 51s. to 96s. a week, he is still no better off. In reality, he is the basic wage in any organized inonly better off to the extent of 2 or 3 per cent., according to the official figures, despite wages boards, arbitration courts, hold-ups, stop-work meetings, &c. The pressure of this indirect Customs and excise taxation-impose d by all previous Treasurers, but by the present Treasurer to a greater degree than any other-is a principal cause of industrial unrest and unhappiness. I have been a working man, I was a trade unionist for years, and I yield to no honourable member opposite iu my sympathy for the worker; I realize why, when he fails to get a wage that is of substantial benefit to him, he turns to the wretched, hopeless policy of reduced hours, reduced output, special rates for overtime, and other expedients to overcome the fact that, although since 1911 his nominal wage has greatly increased, his purchasing power is no greater than it was then. 44-hour week and the agitation for a work of 40 hours or less. The £45,000,000 a year collected in Customs and excise is only the first instalment of the burden, because it is a barrier raised ostensibly for the protection of secondary industries; to it must be added a further huge sum due to the increased cost of goods manufactured in Australia. I view this matter as a sincere protectionist. A lot of this trouble can be overcome by removing the purely revenue duties, and by amending the excise duties; but this committee should not be in too great a hurry to pull down the only scientific taxatioua direct impost on incomes, land, deceased persons' estates, &c. I have shown how the man on the basic wage pays the indirect taxation only until the stage when his wage is adjusted to meet the increased cost of living, after which he is able to pass on the burden. But I crave the sympathy of honourable members for those scores of thousands of unorganized workers who do not receive the basic wage. A graphic example of the evil of this wretched system of indirect taxation is its effect upon all soldiers aud their dependants. Is there one soldier pensioner in this country who is receiving the basic wage? Not one-neithe r the totally incapacitated, nor the blind, nor the tubercular soldier is receiving what is dustry; but all are being oppressed by this wretched indirect Customs and excise taxation, which is being increased to enable relief to be given to the people enjoying high incomes. Consider the circumstances of the many thousands of soldiers' widows and children. The suffering community is paying £45,000,000 out of that £60,000,000 raised under the present pernicious system of taxation. The revenue from Customs ancl Excise has increased by £31,000,000 annually during the last ten years, including £.11,000,000 during the administration of the present Treasurer. The basic wage escapes this taxation. Next the manufacturer, who passes on the tax, escapes. That is the purpose of the tariff. He passes it on in increased prices, and it thus becomes, if I may drop into the language that was used in the State Hence the schools during my youth, ""Last man lousy."" The fiscal taxation is on an utterly unscientific basis, and the last man pays it. Who is he? He is the man on a fixed salary. That would include all school teachers, all doctors, except highly-paid specialists, the lesser lawyers, journalists, the clergy, and the whole of the clerical profession of this country. Every man receiving a salary of less than £700 or £S00 is paying far more in taxation that should be paid in any democracy. Then we come to the real sufferers uncler this taxation scheme, whose parliamentary leader is the Treasurer. The chief sufferer is the primary producer who buys in one of the dearest markets of the world. He buys at prices greatly enhanced by",45,Treasury Notice
197,Mr Gullett,"I agree with thethe operations of the Tariff Board and the Arbitration Court, arid he sells his products in the cheapest market of the world in competition with coloured labour.

There is the wine bounty, in which South Australians are interested, and special financial grants for Western Australia and Tasmania. the wine bounty? ber asks what is wrong with the wine bounty. The wine bounty is a monumental example of extravagance and folly, the greatest ever perpetrated by any Parliament.

I sometimes wonder what would have happened had that gun been loaded and gone of f . It might have shot the Prime Minister, and so changed the whole course of political history in ifr. Stewart. Australia. The honourable gentleman delivered ""good stuff,"" which was popular. His denunciation of the profiteer tickled the ears of what he evidently regarded as the rustic cow cockies of Corangamite, and put the honourable gentleman where he now is, and in doing so it served its purpose. NowI come to the Minister for Markets and Migration ( Mr Paterson), also an ex-PresiThus a l l dent of the Farmers' Union, and one of its stalwarts. There has rarely been a more glaring case of political inconsisFor tency than that displayed by the honourable gentleman. He attacked a nationalist in a nationalist constituency, the ex-member for Gippsland, the Hon. G. H . This pirating of the word Wise. I know the gospel that the Minister preached, because I helped him to preach it. In the same way I know the gospel preached by the Minister for Works and Eailways, the Postmaster General, and the Minister for Markets and Migration, for I helped them all to win their seats. On what grounds did the honourable. gentleman tackle that nationalist? Not on the grounds that he was not au honourable man, that he was not a true representative and country member. Not on the ground that he had neglected his constituency, but upon three counts-1 . Upon the score of economy. 2. Upon the fact that he was aiding and abetting the imposition of a high tariff, which was crushing the primary producer, and, the third and chief count, that, as a country member, he had allied himself with the Nationalist party and could not serve that party and the primary producers of Gippsland, at one and the same time. Preaching that gospel of denunciation, the honourable gentleman, with the aid of labour votes, displaced his opponent from the constituency, which he had served so long and so well To-day the honourable gentleman sits on the front bench with former colleagues of the Honourable George Wise, supports a more spendthrift policy than that gentleman was ever guilty of supporting, and stands for a higher tariff than ever he dreamed of in his whole political existence. Was there ever a more glaring case of inconsistency than this? Yet at the next election, to its everlasting disgrace, the Nationalist party turned down its former champion and placed the whole strength of its organization behind the individual who had defeated him at the previous election. The Country party was formed in the interests of economy. I intended to quote certain figures on that aspect of the case, but they have already been quoted, and I shall not repeat them. But there was another issue which led to thc formation of the party. AVhen the Treasurer first strode upon Australia's political stage, he carried a banner that bore what was to many a new and strange device: I refer to the new State movement. This, the honourable gentleman declared, was the outstanding issue of Australian political life, and everything else sank into insignificance beside it. He would never have become a member of this Parliament had it not been for his advocacy of the new State movement. The honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Abbott) also preached that gospel on the hustings. The same is true of the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson), the honourable member for Riverina( MrI t would be interesting to know whether Killen), and the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green). These gentlemen all came into this House some years ago as advocates of the new State movement, and displaced Nationalists who did not support it. But what has been the record of their party? Is the formation of new States any nearer to-day than it was on the day of their election? their record on this issue is as barren as the hills of Oodnadatta. tariff issue has always been regarded in this country, and indeed in every country, as a big political issue, and the Country party began its career with a low-tariff policy. Even prior to the last election that was still its policy, for the following paragraph appears in an ex-' traordinary agreement that was made at that time between the representatives of the Nationalist and the Country parties in Western Australia and was acquiesced in by the Leader of the Government in the SenateThat, as tlie present high tariff is inimical to the best interests of Western Australia, the f u l l strength of the two associations shall be devoted to securing a substantial reduction in the existing tariff. That, as a reduction can only be secured through our parliamentary representatives, neither shall give its endorsement to any candidate not in agreement with this policy. That, subject to the above-mentioned conditions of policy being accepted as the basis of an appeal to the electors, the Primary Producers' Association is willing to co-operate with the United party of Western Australia in running a joint team, consisting of two representatives of the United party and one representative of the Country party for the forthcoming Senate elections. The team , so selected .shall receive the endorsement and support of both associataions, and no other candidate shall be nominated, endorsed, or supported by either association. What has been the policy of the Government since the election? It has continually increased the tariff. It is due to the Nationalist party tliat I should admit that it is a most versatile body. In the eastern States it marched uuder the flag of high 2 °tection, and in 5r Western Australia it flew the low-tariff banner. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten), who represents a New South Wales constituency, is pledged to a policy of high tariff, while bis colleague in the Cabinet (Senator Pearce) is pledged to a low-tariff policy. the Prime Minister was cognizant of the arrangement that was made between the Nationalist and Country parties in Western Australia. Either the right honourable gentleman acquiesced in this hybrid policy, or else his colleague in Western Australia entered into the agreement without the cognizance of his leader. So much for Western AusI assert that tralia. Let me now read a resolution which the Victorian Farmers' Union The adopted on 13th March, 1925. The 350 delegates present at the meeting unanimously resolvedThat this conference considers the Australian Commonwealth tariff unnecessarily high, and that its incidence is h u r t f u l to the great primary producing interests, and also to the welfare and progress of the Australian community as a whole, nnd this conference further considers that a percentage reduction should be made annually on all tariff items dealing with the staple necessities of primary and secondary industries. Although that resolution was adopted two years ago it still outlines the policy of the .Victorian Farmers' Union, which has now become the Victorian Country party, and the Minister for Markets and Migration ( Mr Paterson), the Postmaster-General( Mr Gibson), and the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Hill) are still pledged to it. The Secretary of the Victorian Country party referred to tliis subject, in a. speech which he delivered at Kyabram, and which was reported in the Argus of the loth June last as follows:Compliance had not yet heen made by the Federal Ministry with continued requests by primary producers to bring about, a general reduction in the incidence of the tariff. Primary producers were more convinced than ever that tlie almost prohibitive duties attached to many of the most important importations were hurtful to the best interests of Australia, and that, more than any other factor, was the reason for so many boards, so many committees, and so many encroachments by unnatural means to bring about results that a simple lowering of duties wouldcertainly achieve. Australia would be benefited greatly if a. percentage reduction were made annually on all tariff items dealing with basic necessities of primary and secondary industries. If any further evidence is needed, we have the words which the Treasurer himself used when, as a private member, he spoke during the budget debate in this House on the 12th October, 1921, in which he attacked his present Leader. He is reported in Hansard as follows:The Treasurer is actually budgeting to secure morerevenue from the tariff this year than rest year. The increase iu Customs should cause him (Air. Bruce) to go into sackcloth and place ashes upon his Jtead. The total amount received that year in Customs and excise duties was about £27,000,000. To-day the Treasurer is budgeting for an income from these sources of £44,800,000. Yet he goes throughout the length and breadth of the country talking about my inconsistency. At any rate, he should be a good judge of inconsistency. We have the spectacle before us of the Leader of the Country party, who is pledged to lower Customs duties, budgeting for the highest Customs receipts on record. During the last five years he has received £76,000,000 more from Customs and excise duties than any other Treasurer in the history of the Commonwealth. for Trade and Customs to say to that? orable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) what the leader of his own party has to say to it? As the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), pointed out this afternoon, the receipts from Customs, excluding excise, in 1921-22, which was the last, complete year prior to the accession to office of the present Treasurer, amounted to £17,328,000. The estimate for 1927-2S is £33,150,000, an increase of more than 91 per cent. This is the result of the administration of the gentleman, who went throughout the country denouncing the Nationalist party, capturing Nationalist seats with the aid of Labour votes, and preaching economy, new States, and tariff reduction. captured Nationalist seats. member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) has good reason for remembering it. The members of this party are to-day going through various constituencies whispering in some places, and openly declaring in others, that their party is still a separate and. independent entity. Some of them have declared that the County party is in no danger of being swallowed by the Nationalist party, but that there is considerable likelihood of the Nationalist party being swallowed by the Country party. The idea of the Treasurer's party swallowing the Nationalist party reminds me of the story of the nigger who went fishing. He caught a much bigger fish than he intended to catch, and it dragged him overboard. As he was being drawn tlirough the water at a rapid rate, he managed to gasp, "" Is this nigger a'fisliin', or is this fish a'niggerin'?"" Where are these gentlemen wbo in 1920-21, so wholeheartedly denounced nationalism and all for which it stood? Whose attitude has changed? Will any one of these honourable members dare to say that the Nationalist party has changed its attitude? They are silent. It is well known that the Nationalist party is the same to-day as it was then. It is composed of the same members, supported by the same press, financed by the same interests, and pursues the same objectives. In 1921 there was no epithet too base or slanderous for these honourable gentlemen to hurl at that party. They were profiteers, according to the Postmaster-General; wasters and spendthrifts, according to the Minister for Works and Railways( MrH ill ) . They were looters and burglars in the words of the Treasurer. What is the attitude of the Nationalists to-day? That of the Leader of the Country party is one of",50,Treasury Notice

In my own electorate, a typical Mallee district, I know returned soldiers who are o working, not 44 hours a week, but, in many cases, 88 hours a week. bave denied themselves all luxuries. Their women folk slave under conditions that are a reflection on this country. After working for ten solid years they are poorer to-day than when they started. This is due to the high costs of production, and, particularly, to the high cost of implements, in spite of the figures furnished by the Minister for Trade and Customs in trying to persuade the producers that the burden amounts to only Is. 6d. a week. These men are convinced that, if the present high costs continue, the wheat-growing industry will be killed. In the Mallee districts breakages of agricultural implements are frequent, and the life of the machines is short. The States are asking for Commonwealth assistance in the form of bounties, and we have . reached a position in which it devolves upon this Parliament, as well as upon the State Parliaments seriously to take stock of the position. dition almost of revolt against the continual increase in production costs. Honourable members on the Opposition side declare that the increased tariff has been swallowed up by the rapacity of the manufacturers, who have increased the cost of their goods and forced the working man to apply to the Arbitration Court for increased wages. The representatives of organized capital, on the other hand, declare that the fault lies with the worker. All that the producers know is that costs have increased to such an extent that they cannot longer bear the burden. them alone the task of competing in the world's markets? secondary industries take their share of the load ? Millions of people overseas require boots. Millions are waiting to be properly clothed. There is an unlimited demand for the products of our secondary industries at world's market rates. If the Minister for Customs and the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), who appear to be a pair of political Siamese Mr Stewart. twins upon this issue, could have their way and would shut out all exports, we should still be compelled to send tens of millions sterling overseas annually in order to meet bur indebtedness. Therefore, we must continue to export. The honourable inember for Wannon adThey vocated last night a discontinuance of borrowing. I clo not agree with him.

247,Mr Stewart,"The honorablerise in the.price of land and a corresponding increase in the cost of production. The stabilizing of land prices is a big problem, but we should not shirk it merely because 'of its magnitude. The second necessity is a better system of finance. At present most of the rural industries are financed through branches of the associated banks. I recognize the good services the banks have rendered to the community, and I do not suggest that they are parasites and should be hunted from the country, but too often their policy has been a selfish and short-sighted to accept lower standards of living than one, so that when things are booming and crcps are good, not only are advances easy to obtain, but producers are actually encouraged to increase their overdrafts, and thus the boom, is accentuated. In times of stress, however, they allow the financial pendulum to swing from extreme optimism to undue pessimism. The third principle I adAocate is the r organization of the primary industries upon a federal basis, to provide for. the scientific marketing of products within Australia iu order to eliminate as far as possible undue waste in distribution. If that can be done, and I believe it can, it will ensure a better return to the prowill admit that there would be no dried ducer and lower costs to the consumer. At present, owing to constitutional limitations, this Parliament cannot grapple with this problem on a federal basis. It can be dealt with only on a federal basis, and I regret that the questions submitted to the people in connection with the last referendum did not include"" one relating to an extenrespect of the 25 per cent, of its producsion of powers to enable industries within Australia to be federally controlled. Fourthly, there should be a survey of primary production in order to determine what products are best suited for export. An export trade is essential to the stability of this country, and about 97 per cent, of the present exports are provided by the primary industries. In the production of wool the plant and labour required are not so great as in other forms of primary production. ""We should find out what industries other than wool-growing can best compete in the markets of the world. I believe that wheat is one of them. By scientific marketing, bulk handling, local and overseas pools, and the elimination of uuneceosary middlemen, the wheat-growing industry could be placed upon an economic basis so that growers could year in and year out compete in the markets of the world. Any industry that could be rightly classed as a potential exporter should be encouraged and extended. Of course, by a system of bounties and fostering any industry could become an exporting industry. I do not advocate an extreme policy in that direction; but this Parliament should not expect those engaged in primary production are demanded by, and granted to, other sections of the community. Those engaged in exporting industries particularly should be encouraged by a system of bounties or Customs rebates upon all plant used in production. For instance, it is fundamentally wrong to expect those engaged in the production of wheat or dried fruits for export to pay high Customs duties, or their equivalent in higher prices for local manufactures, in respect of the implements and tools of their industry, and yet receive only the world's market prices for what they have to sell. fruits industry but for the highly protective duty. protection policy is at present giving the industry a back kick which it never expected. It does not object to paying the high Australian wages and other costs in tion that is consumed locally, but it cannot afford to pay those rates in respect of the 75 per cent, that has to compete overseas against the products of cheap Mediterranean labour. The final suggestion I have to make is that taxation should be readjusted and that rail and ocean freights upon all primary products for export should be reduced. In short, the general principle to be adopted by this Parliament should be that those engaged in exporting primary industries should receive the same rights and privileges and enjoy the same standard of living as are conceded to other sections of the community. able gentleman reduce ocean freights? i",55,Treasury Notice

Of what use to the struggling primary producers are the Treasurer's concessions in income and land taxation? Country party is pledged to reduce Customs and excise duties, and yet he is reducing land tax, income tax, and amusement tax. He reduces those burdens, but increases the burden of Customs and excise which, rightly or wrongly, is the most obnoxious of all forms of taxation to the primary producer. I repeat the statement that stung the Treasurer recently to reply through the press, that there has never been a more glaring example of betrayal by any political party in the history of Australian politics to know just what was the actual opinion than the betrayal of the primary producers of Australia by the Federal Country party upon the tariff issue. A-former member of this House made himself famous by declaring, "" What is a million?"" The Treasurer says, ""What is £20,000,000?"" It is a mere 23 weeks' collection through the Customs. The money market than it has been for many years. Every State of the Commonwealth, with the exception of Tasmania, k which has received a subsidy, has had deficits year after year. this political Nero sits fiddling in tbe midst of it all with a £20,000,000 road scheme and a £20,000,000 housing scheme. He recently introduced into this House a measure for the dismemberment of the Commonwealth Bank, and he endeavoured to convince honourable members that the housing scheme made that step necessary. To use his own words, a heavy burden would be placed upon the directors of the Commonwealth Bank, and consequently steps would have to be taken to separate the administration of the central trading and rural credits department from that of the savings To secure the adoption of their proposal it was stated that this alteration was being made with the full cognizance and acquiescence of the bank directors. The Treasurer declared that one of the commissioners of the savings bank was to be a member of the board, of directors of the bank, so that there would be perfect co-operation between the two branches. Whether or not the honourable gentleman actually said he had consulted with the directors, he certainly gave me to understand that he The Leader of the had, and I believe this House took his statement in the same way. I believe the House understood him to mean that the alterations he proposed to make in tlie bank were being made after full consultation with the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank, and after he had received their approval. Then the honourable gentleman astounded the House by the statement which he made here to-day. I think it was the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) who ventured the observation that be would very much like of the Commonwealth Bank directors on this subject, and it was moved that a select committee be appointed to ascertain the views of the board. The House was under the impression, as a result of the Treasurer's speech, and his replies to interjections, that the bank directors fully understood the proposal, and actually acquiesced in it. Yet to-day we is tighter to-day have the honourable gentleman declaringhe will correct me if I am wrong, because he read tlie statement very hurriedly and sat down as if pleased to have an unpleasant job finished-that he Yet had had a conference with the Governor and two other directors, and that, as a result of that the division of the bank was not necessary.

This budget is typical of the honourable gentleman who presented it. If he reads his own 1921 speech, in which he condemned his present leader, he will, if he has not the hide of a tin hare, slink out of this chamber in shame. To judge by the speeches delivered in this House during the past few days, one would think there was going to be an election next week. Those speeches have been delivered, not with the intention of giving any information to the House, but for the purpose of making the speakers' position more secure with their own constituents, or of doing a little propaganda with someone else's constituents. I am sorry for the members of the Opposition proper, because the pre-selection plebiscite will take place in a little while, ber for Wimmera thought that, by withand four or five of their number are marked for slaughter unless they take up the proper attitude.

There has been much talk also from other members, particularly from the honourable member for Henty( Mr bably the parties would have come back Gullett).

All legislation is brought in by the Government. We members of the'Country party might take exception to measures introduced by the Prime Minister, because he is a member of the Nationalist party. We have as much right to do that as has the honourable member for Henty to object to measures introduced by the Treasurer. As regards increases in the tariff, he knows, as do honourable members opposite, that there was not one proposal The Government has let brought before this House for an increase of duty during the 6$ years that I have been here that had not been advocated by the Labour party. The Labour party supported the increases, not for the purpose of securing additional revenue, but to provide additional work. We have heard from members on this side of the House, also, that men were out of work, and that increased duties were necessary to protect industries which might provide them with employment. I am sorry that my friend from Wimmera( Mr Stewart) has left the chamber. Every one who listened to the personal attack he made on a man whose shoe he is not fit to clean knows that there is something behind it. To find the real reason it is necessary to go back to the days before the 1925 election. A composite party was formed in 1923 Then a composite government came into power in Victoria, with Mr Allan as Premier. The honourable memdrawing from the Government, he could take the whole party with him. If the Government were smashed then naturally the Treasurer could no longer be leader of the party.

267,Mr Hunteb,"There is no man for alizing all the time that there is sonifinstead of reducing the public debt, had increased it by £45,000,000; that when this Government assumed office, the public debt was £416,000,000, and that to-day it is £461,000,000, an increase of £45,000,000. That is true, but the little word "" gross "" was emitted from the comparison. Its inclusion puts an entirely different complexion upon the position. The gross debt of the Commonwealth has increased by £45,000,000, but the gross debt includes money which the Commonwealth raised for the States, and whicli the States must repay. In 1922 the net public £339,000,000. £340,000,000^ an increase of £1,000,000. If we compare the public debt for the year ""1923 with that of 1927, it discloses an increase of £5,000,000, but I am taking the year 1922 as a basis, as this Government then assumed office during the year following. lation of the country has increased considerably during the interim, necessitating additional demands on the finances off the Government for developmental purposes. During the last four years the State debts have increased from £474,000,000 to £606,000,000, and most of these States were Labour governed for the period under review. may safely assume that a similar state of affairs would exist in the federal sphere if Labour were in power here. During the four-year period I have quoted, the Queensland public debt, increased from £79,000,000 to £96,000,000, a difference of £17,000,000, and its per capita debt increased from £103 to £112. The last report of the Auditor-General shows that the Queensland public debt has again increased, from £96,000,000 to £102,000,000, making a total increase of £23,000,000 for the five years. In face of that, the comparative Commonwealth debt increase is insignificant., A similar state of affairs exists in practically all of the other States of Australia, and it must react upon the people. Honourable members opposite endeavour to mislead the people by stating the fault and not of the State We have been told that there has been a vast increase in expenditure since this Mr Hunter. Government assumed ofiice. Let me give the exact figures. The expenditure for 1927 was £60,732,617, which works out at £9 7s. 4d -per head of the population; the expenditure last year was £61,S20,215, which works out at £10 Is. per head; and the expenditure in 1923 was £53,670,S85, which works out at £9 3s. per head. How has the extra money been spent? The increased expenditure of various State Labour Governments has gone in wild-cat enterprises, cattle stations, and other State undertakings. Reverting for a moment to the debt ' was increase in the Conunonwealth public and to-day it is debt, may I point out that an expenditure of between £12,000,000 and £14,000,000 on the Commonwealth ships still has to be met and is included in the Commonwealth debt. The figures show that the, increase in Commonwealth expenditure during the last The popufour years has amounted to about £7,000,000. The accounts set the expenditure out under the headings of war appropriations, special appropriations, and departmental expenditure. The Government has no option but to meet the commitments under the first two headings. The amount that will be paid to the States this year above what they would We have received had the per capita scheme still been continued is £900,445, so that the States will be able to reduce their taxation by that amount if they desire to do so. The extra amount paid in increased invalid and old-age pensions last year-1927-abov e that paid in the year 1923, is £3,720,573, which is, roughly, about 12s. per head of the population. Increases in interest and sinking fund appropriations account for £547,382, the sum of £100,000 has been provided for prospecting for oil and minerals, and £652,991 has been provided for bounties. Our payments in invalid and old-age pensions amount now to £9,144,589 annually. That is, roughly, £1 10s. per head of population, but in the four years the payments have been increased by no less than 12s. per head of the whole population. So the inthat the position is crease in pensions accounts for the greater of the Commonwealth, part of the increase in gross expenditure. Governments. Would any honourable member suggest that our pension payments should be reduced? As I have pointed out, the extra amount that will be paid to the States this year in place of the old per capita payments is £900,445 over last year's payments. The extra amount spent in providing for interest and sinking funds is £143,874, and. the extra amount in bounties is £287,188 over that spent in 1926. As a matter of fact, the Government may only fairly be attacked on its departmental exthat indirect taxation hit the poor man penditure, but there has beeu very little increase in this respect during the last four years. last year amounted to £2,937,233. In 1926 £2,854,591 was spent under this heading, and in 1923 the figure was £2,772,920. The increase in the four years will, thereclared that all government revenue fore, be only about £164,000. It is well known that the work of the departments is continually increasing. If we look at the figures on a. per capita basis, we find owing to the mismanagement of the that there has actually been a decrease in departmental expenditure in the four years of 2d. per head of the population, so how can that there has been no economy? The Government has reduced departmental expenditure, and it has consistently reduced direct taxation, which is the only kind of taxation that it is able to reduce. amounted to £9 13s. Id., or an increase In the last four years the following extra of 12s. 9d. The increase of old-age pena mounts have been spent:-Naval, military, and air defences, £8,227,614; bounties and assistance to primary producers, £2.510,172; road work, £3,750,000; wire netting, £250,000; scientific and industrial research, £350,000; and on oil and mineral prospecting, £200,000; making a total of more than £15,300,000. In addition, a total of £36,000,000 has been paid off the war debt, also over £9,000,000 more receipts of total taxation of £9 7s. lOd, has been paid in old-age pensions than if the pension had remained as it was when the Government took office. In my opinion, these results are simply marvellous, and are an unanswerable reply to critics -who say that the Government has not economized, iu spite of the huge extra amounts it has disbursed. wish now to deal briefly with the revenue figures. Since 1923 our revenue has increased from £54,691,035 "" to £63,36S,214. The income has been obtained from two sources, namely, indirect and direct taxation. The total increase estimated for the year 1927 over the drink, tobacco, &c, and not every man, actual receipts of last year is £4,372.631, woman and .child. In addition, another and over 1923, £S,677,179. The Customs revenue in itself accounts for more than that, for since 1923 it has increased by £10,680.349. It will thus be seen that indirect taxation has increased by a larger amount than the total increase, which means that direct taxation must have been reduced. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) argued while direct taxatiton hit only those persons in the community who were best Departmental expenditure able to pay. Let us look at the figures per head of the population. When the honourable member for Dalley was Premier of Queensland he dewas derived from taxation. The country people in Queensland know to their cost tliat that is true, because they hove been very heavily taxed through the railways Theodore Government. The indirect Commonwealth taxes this year represent £7 2s. 6d. a head, as against £5 0s. it be said 3d. four years ago. The direct tax this year amount to £2 10s. 7d. a head, and four years ago it was £4 0s. Id The direct and indirect tax combined was £9 0s. 3id. in 1922, while in 1927 it sions was £3,854,533 over the amount paid in 1922, or 12s. 4d. a head, and the roads vote about 6s. a head, so these two together showed a total increase of about ISs. a head of the population. Is any member in favour of wiping out these expenditures? One would think the Labour party and other critics were. The present year, _ 1927-2S, shows estimated an increase of 7s. 7d. a head from what it was in 1922, and os. 2d. less than last year, 1926-27. Althoughi t is claimed that indirect taxes bear heavily on the poor man, I point out that, of the* £43,000,000 raised through the' Customs this year, £25,000,000 was collected from I road users and the purchasers of petrol, wine and spirits, and tobacco. working man. not sound, for only a special class use £6,000,000 was collected in duties on",60,Treasury Notice

Out of the £7 2s. 6d. a head paid in indirect taxes this year, only about £1 18s. was contributed by the man in the street, and can be evenly divided among the whole. All taxes effect every man, woman, and child in the community, when they add to the cost of living. The working man is compensated for this increase by the Arbitration people cannot pass it on at all, and have to bear the brunt of it. So bounties and other help such as roads, netting, and taxation relief become necessary for them. not encouraged in Queensland because that State still suffers from the "" Theodore blight,"" and, so long as it remains, manufacturers will refrain there. A reduction of direct taxation would help industries and provide increased employment. The present Government has consistently reduced direct taxation: but can any honourable member mention a way in which it is possible to reduce indirect taxation? These taxes are passed on by all except the man on the land and the investment income man. The honourable member for Dalley favours prohibitive duties. If the tariff were reduced, imports would increase and the Customs revenue would be greater than ever, and the country would be inundated by unemployed, whose keep would eventually fall back on the man on the land. Prohibitive duties would absolutely kill the primary producer who cannot pass on the increased burden. Yet that is the remedy advocated by the honourable member for Dalley who travelled throughout Queensland asking the farmers to support the Labour party. That they never did, and never will do. I want the country people to note particularly what he proposes to do. He has changed his rune for the simple reason that he now represents an industrial electorate which includes Cockatoo Island Dockyard. dare not go into any country electorate and tell the people that the remedy for rheir present troubles is a reduction of indirect, taxation and the imposition of ilr. Hunter. would mean a still greater increase for everything the country man buys. The Treasurer has been blamed for increasing the indirect taxation, but every increase of duty was asked for by honourable members opposite. A l ways we were told that increased protection would encourage the local industry, and enable it to produce more cheaply,, but within a very short time the manufacturers were calling for still higher duties. Court, but the country Why? The explanation is plain-the „ manufacturer cannot compete against the overseas goods' even though they areloaded wif h heavy duties. Tbe unions demand a close preserve and ask that dutiesManufacturing industries are be increased so that there will be no competition from overseas; but any increased price that the manufacturer is able to charge for his goods must be passed on to them in tbe form of higher pay and from establishing businesses shorter hours, but never anything to the consumer. I have never heard honourable members opposite advocate increased protection for tbe same reasons as are advanced by high protectionists in the United States of America. The American manufacturers say "" Let us have a high tariff Avail that will block out foreign goods, and when we have the local market to ourselves Ave shall be able to engage in massed production, and produce a cheaper article."" And they do that. But never does a cheaper article come out of Australian factories as a result of high protection. Labourists demand that any increase in the price of local goods made possible by the heaA-y duty on imports shall be shared amongst the employees, and that nothing shall be given to the consumers Avho haA'e paid for that protection. They ask that the door be closed against imports, not in order to facilitate mass production and the cheapening of goods to the consumer, but in order that they may get an industry into their own grip and levy toll on their fellows, particularly the men living in the country AA'IIO cannot pass it on. Eeducing the value of production in 1925 to the purchasing power of the sovereign in 1911, He Ave find that production has decreased 5 per cent in the fourteen years. That5 per cent. Avas equivalent to £21,000,000 on the 1925 production, Avhich, invested at compound interest, would prohibitive duties, because it pay off the Avar debt in fourteen years, and tlie whole of the national debt in 21 years. Between 1911 and 1925 there was great mechanical progress and invention. The power of the machinery employed in onr factories increased from 343,000 horse-power to 1,335,000 horsepower, and the value of plant from £31,000,000 to £112,000,000. Yet in spite of those advances and the increased local market created by high Customs duties, the value of production in 1925 was 5 per cent, below that in 1911. That is the explanation of the present unemployment. The only .remedy for Australia's industrial conditions is greater and more economical production. We can rectify the adverse trade balance by selling more goods, and this can be done only by producing more cheaply. If we close the door against all imports and the prices of local manufactures rise, the primary producers will find that the more he exports the more he will lose, because his costs will be greater. Therefore, he will adopt the Labour party's policy of producing less, and the nation will suffer by a loss in exports. The real solution of the problem is to produce more of the goods we sell overseas; and to 'do that and enable the exporter to sell at a profit, we must manufacture more in our factories at a lower cost. I have never heard members of the Opposition suggest that remedy. the members of the"" unions that they must "" buck in ; "" they never advocate the adoption of piecework and payment by results. more he will produce. The more profit an employer gets from his business, the more capital he will invest in extending it. will not invest more money. The attitude of the worker is the same. him by results, and the more money he gets into his pocket the more goods he will produce. Unfortunately, the doctrine preached to the workers from time to time is that there is a vast fund of wealth of which the manufacturers' motor car is one outward and visible symbol, and if the employee gets another pound a week in wages, all that will happen will be that the boss will have to walk to work. The only f imd out of which profits and wages are paid is production, and the limitation of it hurts not only those engaged in industry, but the, whole nation. The blame for our adverse trade balance and the unemployment in all States must be placed on those honourable members opposite who call themselves leaders of Labour, but follow all the time. We saw that illustrated in the recent election in New South Wales, when they were "" tumbling over themselves "" to follow the crowd behind Mr Lang, as they were afraid of the plebiscites. Labour members have the remedy in their own hands. If they will advocate payment by results, more goods will be produced, and they will be sold at a cheaper price. Nothing is wrong with the position in Pederal politics; the trouble is in the State Parliaments, in most of which the v Treasury benches are occupied by Labour. Federal electors have only to look at what has happened in Queensland and New South Wales to see how dangerous it would be to return Labour to power in the Federal Parliament. Honourable members opposite call themselves the representatives of labour; actually they do not represent labour i i i this country, but only a section of it, which is white-anting the nation. The budget proposals of the Government 1 indicate clearly' that the finances have been carefully nurtured. The people of Australia are well aware of They never tell this.

It is true that honourable members on this side of the chamber do not see eve to eye with the Ministry in all things; but we are not under the control of any outside body or influence. We are free agents, freely supporting a Government which, by the vote cf the people, is occupying the treasury bench on a certain policy that was agreed to by two mutually independent political parties working in co-operntion. Some members on this side owe no allegiance to the Country party as a. party; l)u t we are in alliance with it, and tbe Leader of that party is the Treasurer in the present composite Government. It would be well if the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) had borne this in mind when making his attack on that honourable gentleman.

I can assure honourable members opposite that it will take them a long time to persuade a great majority of the workers of Australia that the Russian-made policy of socialization of industry, production, disa representative of labour as 'any pledged tribution, and exchange to which they are as a party committed, is the best for Australia. I listened with interest to the speech of the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart). Certainly it lacked nothing in vigour or directness, and I could not help admiring him for his earnestness. With a great deal of what he said I am also in accord. Especially do I approve of his references to the damaging influences of high tariffs upon primary industry. Honourable members generally will agree that, apart from his personal references to his former ministerial colleague,. the Treasurer, he made a most effective speech, and, from his point of view, delivered a telling indictment against the Government. I have a high personal regard for the honourable member for Wimmera. We have a common bond of union in our early nautical associations; but I object to his classing me as a representative of vested interests. The honourable member for Wimmera spoke favourably of the Labour party in respect of certain of its actions, which, he said, were of benefit to the primary producers. He then referred to honourable members on this side of the House as-, representabe right up to a certain point.

274,Sir Elliot Johnson,"It may1 can openly advocate what I believe to be the interests of labour. Those who call themselves members of the Labour party are bound by certain pledges, and are controlled by outside bodies, who manufacture opinions and, in some cases, even consciences for them. I honestly believe that some honourable members opposite bear unwillingly the yoke placed ou their necks by the outside controlling executive authority of their party. There are many honourable members on. this side whose sympathies are with the legitimate aspirations of the genuine Labour movement, but who cannot conscientiously ally themselves with the Labour party as it is constituted to-day. I am one of them, and represent a constituency which is largely industrial, and is mainly represented in the State Parliaments by men who call themselves Labour members. I could not retain that seat if it were not for the votes of working men. In spite of the most strenuous efforts of the members of the Labour party for the last 25 years to capture that seat from me, I have been able to hold it against all they are in sympathy with Nationalist the forces and all the big guns that have been imported to assist in the election campaigns. because the working men of my constituency are sensible men. The stereotyped platitudes and fanatical ideas imported from Bussia because of the poverty of ideas among the members of thc Labour party, do not appeal to the sensible working men of this country. They appeal to the flappers, both male nnd female, who have not attained the age of discernment between horse sense and -mere foolish claptrap. These vapourings and these shibboleths may appeal to them, but not to those who have the interests of Australia and their own personal interests at heart, and who know on which side their bread is buttered. The Nationalist candidate for the Federal Parliament, at any rate, is reckoned to be good enough for the working men of my electorate. be so in Queensland. Sir Queensland working men do not seem to be particularly enamoured of the Eussian policy, jndging by the few representatives of that State in the Federal Parliament. Notwithstanding that Labour is in the ascendancy in the State Parliament, due largely to the gerrymandering of electorates, one would almost need a microscope to find Queensland Labour representatives in this chamber. In the midst of all the criticism that has been levelled against the Treasurer, I should like to say a word of commendation on his behalf, as an offset to the onslaughts of one or two previous speakers. The budget has been favourably commented upon by the press all over Australia. strongly criticized it. only the other day that oue of the honourable member's colleagues quoted with great gusto, and with every sign of oommendation, a leading article that appeared in a capitalistic newspaper. Newspapers exist by favour of the public, and therefore, if the people largely contribute to Nationalist newspapers, the natural and obvious inference is that principles. At any rate, in respect of the budget, there was a general chorus of I hold my scat .mainly approval by the pross, which was echoed and endorsed by the public in the various States. One of the reasons for the enthusiasm with which the budget has been received by the public is the fact that it is based upon a sincere and genuine attempt to place the finances of this country upon a sound, practical, and economical basis. One of the best things that this Government has done has been to abolish the per capita payments. We all recollect the storm of opposition that arose, not only from that side, but also from this side of the House, and also from various newspapers, against the proposed abolition of the per capita payments. Notwithstanding that the Government, with the support of its followers, abolished the per capita payment, objection to the proposal was raised in the first instance by the less populous States owing to the fear that under the new arrangement their financial position however, convened a conference of Oommonwealth and State Ministers, which the Government met in a most generous' spirit, and adopted a",65,Treasury Notice

Not the least important feature of the Treasurer's financial proposals is the arrangement under which united action is to be taken in the matter of debt redemption, the control of future borrowings, and the stabilization of the loan market which should result in Australia's credit being materially improved. If the Government had not done more than this, it would have gained thc commendation of the taxpayers. It has also substantially reduced our war debt, in connection with which a sinking fund has been established, and has also reduced taxation, which will be hailed with delight, particularly by those who are contributing fairly large sums in the form of land and income taxation. As a great majority of taxpayers will not, however, be relieved to any great extent, I hope to hear of some intimation later from the Treasurer that it is the intention of the GovernmentI hope it is not yet too late-to proceed further in the direction of reducing indirect as well as direct taxation.
