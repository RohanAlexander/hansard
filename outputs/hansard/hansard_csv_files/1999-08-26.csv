The environmental impact statement brought down by Rust PPK said that there were clear alternatives with regard to what could happen here. One of those alternatives was that Sydney airport could be expanded. Another alternative was that other airports in capital cities could be expanded, that regional airports could be expanded or that you could do nothing. What is the federal cabinet looking at now? Doing nothing. What is involved in the do nothing option? To listen to the Sydney Airport Corporation, to listen to the Tourism Task Force, and to listen to a bloke who did his honours thesis and parrot most of what he has to say so that for the next 10 or 15 years they will not have to make a decision that is crucial to the infrastructure needs of the entire country. That do nothing option involves the potential displacement of 3,500 jobs from Bankstown Airport, the destruction of the general aviation infrastructure at Bankstown Airport, the cost of moving that airport to Badgerys Creek and ongoing disruption depending upon whether they choose to phase it in or to do it in one hit. It also involves this: an easy transition for every person coming in on regional aircraft from KSA to Bankstown. What is being pushed is a dedicated regional airport at Bankstown. What implications would that open up? For the bush members, for all those National Party members who represent seats in the New South Wales bush, it means that the promise and absolute guarantee that their constituents would have access for regional services to Kingsford Smith airport under the long-term operating plan would be broken. They would be pushed off to Bankstown. They would have an extra half an hour added to their journeys. But it would not be just half an hour. It would be an hour or an hour and a half that would be added on to their journeys. The time needed to do business in the city and to make connections to other interstate flights-all of that-would be extended, and they would be treated like second-class citizens. All of those regional flights that would be displaced would allow this: 25 to 38 per cent more jets going into Kingsford Smith airport. This do nothing proposal would entrench and embed Kingsford Smith airport. It would allow the airlines and all of the vested interests associated with them who have extracted $1 billion from this government to expand the airport until 2003 to continue to expand Kingsford Smith airport to the detriment of the people of Bankstown, to the detriment of the region and to the detriment of Australia.(Time expired) Republic Referendum: Vote referendum and vote for a new republic or for the existing monarchy.

It has proven far from perfect, but it has nevertheless been resilient during this century. However, to deny the citizens of Australia the opportunity for change would be to deny the historical reality that Australia itself has changed since Federation-socially, culturally, economically and politically. A republic, by definition, is where the supreme power resides in the body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by representatives chosen directly or indirectly by them. That is surely the most pure form of democracy imaginable. Some argue that today's monarchy has no actual powers over its citizens. If that is the case then why have one-for reasons ceremonial, for the sake of historical ties or because we like the royal family? I, too, like the Queen, and when she is in Australia next year I will give her the full courtesy accorded any head of state. But she is not an Australian. The proposed republican model is not exactly as I would have chosen. I am concerned about the dismissal procedure. But, then again, I am sure that we all have certain sticking points with our current system, and we will with any other. But to vote no on this basis is to invite an even more extreme model within 10 years. If the framers of our Constitution had tried to please everyone to the letter, we would still be six colonies and not one nation. We have arrived at the republican choice through a very democratic process---even if a minority still decries the validity of the 1998 Constitutional Convention. In 100 years as a nation, we have earned the right to our own head of state-an Australian. I look forward to the day when every Australian man, woman and child, not through hereditary rights but through their rights as an Australian citizen, will have that opportunity. Nothing gives my migrant parents greater bonour than to have their son a member of this parliament. Equally, it would be a great honour for me to see my children have an opportunity to go one step better than their old man. One must give full credit to this Prime Minister and this government who have delivered on a referendum to establish an Australian republic. I am happy that all parliamentarians have been granted a true conscience vote on this issue in the manner of all other Australians. We are not debating our flag, our place in the Commonwealth, the states or the Senate, merely whether we should have our own head of state. I say yes, in the realisation that my vote is only as good as any other Australian's. On7 November, I look forward to being part of a coalition government which will once again focus on those issues important to the people of Deakin-unemployment, business growth, drugs, health and continuing economic prosperitywhether we are a republic or whether we have voted for the status quo. Balga Action Group Ms JANN McFARLANE (Stirling}-In June this year, I personally wrote to every family in the suburb of Balga in my electorate of Stirling. This letter contained an invitation to a community morning tea, an invitation to visit my mobile office and a community survey. I would like to thank the large number of Balga families who took the time to complete the survey and return it to my offic-. A key finding of the survey was that Balga residents are proud of their suburb and quite rightly resent the actions of the media and some politicians who continually seek to highlight the negative aspects of Balga. I want to make it clear that I am proud to represent Balga in the federal parliament. It is a great suburb and its people are its greatest asset. 9270 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 August 1999 TodayI want to highlight the achievements of some of the people who are taking an active role in improving their local community through direct community action, and the Balga Action Group. The Balga Action Group evolved out of community action to help reduce the crime rate by demolishing several blocks of three-storey Homeswest flats. These flats, a failed social experiment from the 1960s, were almost unfit for human habitation, a fact that the government of the day recognised. The Western Australian state government wanted to refurbish these flats as part of their New North program. The residents of Balga were not happy with this option, and, through the establishment of the Balga Action Group, successfully lobbied for the flats to be demolished and replaced with quality housing. The group costed two options: the government option, which was to refurbish the flats, which were 30-year-old buildings, and sell them to low income people; and the Balga residents' option, which was to demolish the flats and replace them with better quality housing and, again, sell them to people on low incomes. The group showed that the Balga residents' option was economically viable and socially beneficial. The government decided on the Balga residents' option-a win for the group, the local residents and the government. Since their win, the group have been busy working to provide solutions to problems experienced within their community. Issues addressed by a subcommittee of the group include the building of a skateboard park, lobbying for the construction of an overpass in Mirrabooka and a main road beautification program. Some of the group's upcoming events are, firstly, an annual clean-up day. Many respondents to my survey have identified the state of Balga's verges and parks as contributing towards people's poor perception and negative attitudes towards Balga and to crime in the suburb. Secondly, there will be a Christmas family day, which is going to include community information stalls, music, dance, carols by candlelight, a sausage sizzle and other activities. In undertaking these activities, this Balga community group has shown that people working together can address the issues and can build an attachment to their suburb. That is why I am proud to represent them in the federal parliament. It is groups like this that show that the volunteer spirit is not dead in Australia. (Time expired) Telstra: Rural and Regional Services rural media about the level of service that Telstra provides to its customers. As a member in a rural seat, I can tell you that at times the service from Telstra is appalling. Mistakes happen in every occupation, and jobs fall through in every enterprise. That is the reality of business. But constituents with telephone problems, some of which have been going on for a year, come to me for help and suddenly the problem is fixed. In Telstra's case, increasing numbers of complaints about its performance result in appeals persisting through my office. Why are there so many people having problems with Telstra? One couple whom my staff and I helped to have their telephone line fixed had been waiting over 12 months with a telephone line dangling over their fence. The line frequently disconnected in bad weather and had to be spliced by hand by these customers. Technicians came to the property shortly after my office had made contact with Telstra and told the owners they had to fix the problem fast because it was a 'hot case'. In other words, the family were not getting their telephone fixed because it was their turn or because Telstra decided it was necessary; they got their telephone fixed because a politician had become involved. While my staff and I enjoy helping people and recognise that our liaison with Telstra might give them",118,Representatives Main Committee
174,Mr Schultz (Hume),"The part sale of Telstra has raised increasing questions from theThursday, 26 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9271 an insight into problems they may not be aware of, it horrifies me that these constituents ring up Telstra week after week and month after month, trying to have their cases heard and their problems solved, and all they get is a cut-and-paste response. Can you imagine how these people feel when something they have pleaded to have fixed for months and months and after several telephone calls is suddenly fixed when they call our office? Relief is their first reaction, and then they start to think about whether Telstra even listened to them. And do they listen? Telstra respond that they have insufficient staff and no funds to employ more staff and provide more equipment. They even use the weather as an excuse. If they are so understaffed and underfinanced, how can they drop everything and have a problem fixed because one of my colleagues or I have contacted them? Some members and their staff may be flattered by this treatment-and I certainly appreciate the gesture-but it raises questions about the treatment of constituents, the people who put us where we are. Frankly, Hume residents or any rural residents should not have to call the electorate office to have their problems solved. They should be heard by Telstra employees, and each case should be treated with compassion and fairness. I am not suggesting that every problem should be solved within 24 hours and neither are the residents of Hume. WhatI am calling for is more understanding from Telstra and their employees. We all have patience, and constituents in Hume who have contacted Telstra with their problems have been quite patient and willing to wait. Could you imagine waiting for a year to have your telephone connected? I can think of several cases where elderly residents and pregnant women living in isolation have waited up to six months to have access to a telephone line. I am not here today to complain about how the government is handling Telstra. Indeed, the staff of both Senator Alston and Senator Ian Campbell have been extremely helpful most of the time. I am not even complaining about the fact that so many communication problems occur. WhatI am concerned about is that the previous Labor government spent money on kilometres of underground copper, which clearly did not have the political attraction of spending above the ground. My constituents are now living with the legacy of that undercapitalisation. (Time expired) Australian Taxation Office: Proposed Removal of Cashiers process of abandoning face-to-face public contact and is going the way of the banks, Australia Post and other large corporations in making themselves less accessible and less personal. In our dealings with the bureaucracy, MPs often lead privileged lives because, in many cases, we have access to relatively secret direct phone numbers or have staff to deal with phone queues and the like. We do not understand much about the evils of call centres: what it is like to be held in a queue or not knowing which option to press. I do not think we appreciate how difficult it can be for an ordinary person trying to deal with the bureaucracy. The tax office intends to close all its cashier facilities by January next year and to cut back public contact opportunities. These things are being described euphemistically as ATO 'access' sites. This is a piece of Orwellian -newspeak where black is white and white is black. The access sites look very much like 'no-access' sites. We have already seen cashier facilities closed in Brisbane, Geelong and Canberra, and concern has been expressed to me about proposals for Newcastle, Townsville, Perth and Cannington by Kim Wilkie, the member for Swan, and Jann McFarlane, the member for Stirling.",120,Representatives Main Committee
175,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills},"I want to express the fear that the tax office is in the9272 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 August 1999 There are substantial implications of getting rid of the cashier and client service facilities. For example, there will be no place where a person can make a voluntary HECS payment or a voluntary tax payment in advance or purchase tax vouchers. There are limits on the amount of cash and cheques that Australia Post, the alternative, can accept. I am told, for example, that Alcoa tried to pay a tax office bill in excess of $51 million by cheque and were refused. We can see that this is throwing up very substantial problems. There are difficulties involved in achieving same day banking, and this could mean a loss of interest revenue to the tax office. It would also appear that the closure of cashier facilities is in direct breach of the taxpayers charter. The explanatory booklet No. 15 of the charter-and this is being distributed to the public-specifically states with respect to paying your taxes: If paying in person at a Tax Office, you can pay by cash, cheque or postal money order ... from 8.30am to 4.4Spm Monday to Friday. That is no longer the case. Concern has also been expressed at the Newcastle office about the implications of this change. You have a situation where the public is being encouraged to use phone inquiries, even to the point of being asked to ring the call centre whilst on A TO premises. It has been pointed out that this is a very valuable service for small business. I call on the tax office to review it. I think that failure to do so would generate suspicion that the tax office is running away and hiding in the face of the GST implementation debacle. (Time expired) Telstra: Rural and Regional Services regional and rural Australia. The removal of banks is one dimension of this problem, but the removal of phone boxes from isolated communities sets a new benchmark in the abrogation of civic responsibility and it is a demonstration of insensitivity. To my way of thinking, it negates every positive image of Telstra as part of the fabric of regional and rural Australia. Measured against the less than satisfactory performance in the installation and service of domestic customers, it shows how painfully out of touch Telstra has become with rural Australians. In the little community of Ubobo in the centre of the Boyne Valley in my electorate, a fatuous notice appeared in the one and only phone box indicating the removal of that box some time after 15 October. The euphemism of 'relocation' was used in the notice which was code for, 'We're about to rip out your phone box.' In response to an objection, a Telstra executive suggested that the people of Ubobo use the phone box up the road, which just happened to be 17 kilometres away. In the other direction, it is 52 kilometres to the township of Calliope. In other words, Telstra was prepared to leave a 70-kilometre-long stretch of road through the Boyne Valley without a public phone. Ubobo and its adjoining community of Nagoorin are isolated communities. Many residents live in low socioeconomic conditions; many of them have no domestic phones whatsoever. A public hall is the centre of the Boyne Valley for public meetings and the requirement of a phone box for safety is, indeed, most important. To fund the Sydney to Hobart yacht race, the Hockeyroos and the Telstra Dolphins, while denying communications as a basic right of all citizens in remote and isolated areas, particularly those who are in deprived circumstances, is a social obscenity. This is just one of many phone boxes targeted in my area. I have another one at Canoe Point near Boyne Tannum, another one at the Tipperary Flats in the township of Mount Morgan and yet another one in Mount Larcom. I serve notice on Telstra, and anyone else who is so lacking",121,Representatives Main Committee

Second Reading Debate resumed from 24 June, on motion by Mr Entsch: That the bill be now read a second time. (Submerged Lands) Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. We also support the amendments which I understand the government proposes to move at a subsequent stage. I will cover those shortly. Broadly, the changes which the amendment bill before us today proposes to the principal act, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, relate to improving government administration of petroleum exploration and the efficient production of our petroleum resources. Many of the amendments are designed to adapt the act to the present-day characteristics of the petroleum industry, with respect to both the economic circumstances of that industry in the new millennium and also the many technological changes which have taken place in the industry in the last few years and which will undoubtedly occur over the next decade or so. The substantive new provisions in the bill include the introduction of infrastructure licences to cater for at-sea operations that do not strictly fall within the ambit of the current production or pipeline licences. They also include an option to introduce the use of supplementary bids to decide between exploration permits that are otherwise ranked equal, and the creation of a new offence of deliberately interfering with an offshore petroleum operation or the related installations. That is obviously very significant when you consider the isolation of these facilities, their enormous economic value and, of course, most importantly, the way in which any interference with those facilities would put at risk the lives of those who work on those production platforms. The bill also repeals a number of provisions which are fairly technical. They relate to the length of pipeline licences and to the joint authority'S discretion to fix the number of blocks and also to the fragmentation constraints on areas covered by permits being renewed. I also understand that the government intends to move a number of amendments to the bill which it has introduced which follow a re-examination of the provisions of the bill by the industry, which raised concerns about a number of points of potential ambiguity in the wording of some of the provisions in relation to the rights conferred by infrastructure licences which, unless rectified, would leave some uncertainty in the licensing regime for petroleum exploration and development, in that the rights conferred by an infrastructure licence could be more limited than is intended by the bill. There are a number of other supplementary amendments which I believe are technical in nature and which are supported by the opposition in general terms. I do not think it is necessary at this stage to go through those in detail. While this legislation is, as I have said, largely technical in nature it concerns a very vital and important industry for Australia. Australia has very substantial petroleum reserves, be they oil or gas reserves, and we also have very significant non-traditional oil reserves in the form of our shale oil reserves in Queensland and in other locations, as well as new, untapped resources in the oil and gas areas, for example, in the Timor Gap, alongside the traditional areas of Bass Strait, Gippsland, the areas that Santos operates at Moomba in my own state",122,Representa Tiyes Main Committee
177,Mr Martyn Evans (Bonython) (9.59 A.m.),"The opposition supports the Petroleum9274 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 August 1999 of South Australia and, of course, the very vast reserves off the coast of Western Australia in the form of the Gorgon fields and the North West Shelf, operated by Woodside and their many partners in this operation. Those resources, which have only been tapped in recent years, relatively speaking, have made Australia largely self-sufficient in liquid fuels-in fact, I think we are about 70 per cent self-sufficient-and oil and natural gas account for over half of the country's energy needs. With respect to the exports which flow from these wells, we are not a large exporter of oil, of course, but we are certainly a very substantial exporter of gas. The North West Shelf represents one of the largest capital facilities of its kind in the country. It is our largest resource and infrastructure project and a very substantial earner of overseas exchange for this country. Indeed, the net exports in total for the industry as a whole represent about $1 billion per annum. The North West Shelf provides very substantial exports. On a recent visit to the North West Shelf facilities, courtesy of Woodside and their partners, I was able to see for myself the enormous size and value of that resource and the massive investment in capital facilities and related infrastructure which is required to extract gas from very substantial depths under the sea and to then process and export the gas. Indeed, tankers leave that facility every couple of days, largely bound for Japan. The value of gas in each shipment is about $13 million. It is coincidental that, as we debate this legislation, Woodside and the North West Shelf partners celebrate of the order of their 1,000th cargo to Japan, which has taken place over a period of about the last 10 years. I take this opportunity to join with others, including the government, in congratulating Woodside and their partners in the North West Shelf on what is effectively 10 years of almost fault-free operation of 1,000 cargoes leaving for Japan and a decade, as I have said, of virtually perfect operating circumstances. A great deal of work has been required of the staff and the company to ensure that that level of uptime is available at that facility because it is a very complex operation and one which requires very considerable expertise. The number of people employed on that facility is not particularly large, and as you look around the production plant offshore or the production facility at the Burrup Peninsula, you are struck by the very massive nature of the capital investment and the relatively small number of people required to operate it. However, it is a full-shift operation, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days of the year. The reason for the modest number of people involved is that once the facility is in production, it is very much an automated operation. There is not much that individuals can do to further that, except by way of preventative maintenance and ensuring the safe operation of the plant. The people who do work there-at all levels of the work force-are very highly skilled and qualified, and collectively they make a very substantial contribution to Australia's GDP. They have a very significant multiplier effect on the economy. Although the number of jobs actually on production facilities is not that large, there is no doubt that, when you look at the multiplier effect that these jobs have throughout the community, every million dollars of investment in those kinds of facilities produces one full-time job and 3.5 consequential jobs throughout the community of Australia-in particular in this case, Western Australia, but obviously generally throughout the Australian community-through the addition to our gross domestic product. That contribution should not be overlooked when one looks at the total impact of the gas industry on Australia as a whole. Thursday, 26 August 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 9275 As I have said, Woodside has never missed a shipment from that facility. There are very substantial penalties, of course, for missing shipments; this is the kind of industry where mistakes are simply not tolerated, either from a safety point of view or from a commercial point of view. It is essential that the appropriate infrastructure regime, financial regime and government regulatory regime be in place to underpin these kinds of operations. I only use the Woodside North West Shelf operation as an example-the most pre-eminent example at the moment but an example, nonetheless, of the way these facilities operate. It is very important that all of that associated infrastructure, from a government regulatory and fiscal point of view and also from the operating perspective, is in place, and in place on a long-tenn and certain basis. That is because the massive investment in the capital infrastructure requires very long-tenn certainty about what the government regulatory regime and the fiscal regime will be. If you are going to invest billions of dollars, literally, in the original establishment of the kind of plant which we see at Woodside's facilities, or if you are going to continue to invest-as the North West Shelf partners are proposing to do at the moment-further billions of dollars to increase the capacity of the production facility there, by adding additional trains to the LNG production plant, then obviously you are going to need considerable certainty about the environment in which you are operating. It is for that reason that this area has largely enjoyed substantial bipartisan support in the past in Australia and I believe it should continue to do so. Obviously, as one of the few fully developed countries with substantial gas reserves, Australia is in a different position from many of our competitors in this industry. The only other country in a similar economic situation to us which enjoys substantial gas or petroleum reserves in that context is probably Alaska. Australia and Alaska between them suffer very significant disadvantages over some of their competitors like Malaysia, Indonesia, Qatar and many of the other countries which have very large volumes of gas to export but who also have the advantage-in an economic sense--of lower wage rates, of governments who are substantial owners of these facilities and of massive tax and other concessions which are made to the companies. As I will cover more fully later, these countries are less affected, in the economic sense, by the constraints of the greenhouse gas problem. Australia is just about the only country that is constrained by the Kyoto protocol, although that remains in the future-we have not yet accepted the protocol in its entirety and, of course, it is not yet in operation. But the reality is that, if it were, Australia is the only country effectively with large gas reserves that is required to honour the very constraining tenns of that protocol, whereas our competitors in this area are not so constrained. They enjoy not only those greenhouse advantages but also substantial advantages in taxation concessions, in the government assistance available to them and in tenns of being government owned and with the freedom that gives them to operate within their own country. So, when we look at the regulatory and fiscal regimes which we impose in Australia, we have to keep in mind what applies to our competitors because gas is very much a commodity. Gas is gas is gas, wherever you obtain it from, and Japan and the other major customers around the world are not that concerned as to whether the gas comes from Australia or Indonesia or Malaysia or Qatar or one of the other countries who are able, equally as well as Australia, to supply that gas. So it is in our national interest to ensure that Australia is a very competitive producer of LNG, that we produce it at the most efficient level possible, and that we do so using the technological advantages which Australia has over some of its competitors in tenns of our highly educated work force and in tenns of the access to high technology 9276 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 August 1999 which Australia has and the skills of our people in the production, drilling and the shipping of this very valuable commodity. Woodside has made substantial inroads into the international marketplace over the last decade or so. They have ensured that Australia is a significant competitor in this marketplace. But we are still only one of those competitors and we will always have to fight for our share of the increased demand which will occur over the next few years throughout the world. We will see, in the next decade or so, countries such as China, India, Korea and Taiwan as the major potential purchasers of new gas suppliers, and they are free to choose that gas from anywhere they like, from producers around the world. If Australia is to be a substantial supplier to those new and emerging and very substantial markets, we must ensure that our producers are as competitive as possible in this context. Asian LNG demand is likely to rise very substantially over the next 10 years. If we participate in that growing demand, Australia will enjoy very significant benefits in terms of the export revenue which that will generate. We also will contribute very significantly to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions throughout the world. There remains some argument amongst not only scientists but also politicians and the community in general about the impact of the greenhouse gas issue. I take the view that it is a very serious question which we cannot possibly ignore. If the world decides to conduct an experiment to see whether the greenhouse gas effect is real or not and, if real, just how serious, then, unfortunately, by the time we find the answers to that question, by the time we see the results of that experiment, it will be far too late for the world to turn back and reverse the effects. So we have to operate on the basis that the effect is both real and significant, and that it will have adverse climatic impact on the planet as a whole. I think the evidence for that is very strong. It is very clear from unambiguous scientific measurement that the level of CO2 in the atmosphere has been rising dramatically since the industrial revolution. That is unambiguous and clear-cut. The only question which is not so certain is what impact that will have on climate. Obviously, the greenhouse effect per se is real. Greenhouses do work. I have many of them in my own electorate. I have stood in many of them and compared the effect on the growth of the tomatoes and other cash crops-some of them legal, some of them not-in my electorate. Quite clearly, the greenhouse effect works in greenhouses. Whether the planet is a giant greenhouse or not has yet to be determined. I suspect that it is, and that those who put their faith in greenhouse feedback measurestliat are, effectively, just natural measures-recycling in the atmosphere, extra growth of algae in the oceans and so on to soak up some of the CO 2 so that it does not have an impact on climate--are very much engaged in wishful thinking. I think our children and our children's children will not thank us if we ignore this effect now. But does that mean we should rush headlong into changes which will have very adverse impacts on our own economy? The answer is no. Very clearly, through sensible planning and the rational use of our existing resources, we can have a significant impact on our greenhouse gas emissions without substantial adverse effects on the world and the Australian economy. The reason I labour this point is that gas is a very sensible, even vital transition fuel to ensure that we are able to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions while retaining the levels of economic growth which support employment growth and the real standard of living which Australians and many citizens throughout the world have come to enjoy. Thursday, 26 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9277 That leaves the developing countries--such as China and India, less so Korea and Taiwan, but many other countries in Africa and South America and parts of Asia-which also want to see their standard of living grow. What we have to do is ensure that they base that growth on greenhouse friendly methods. Using gas as a transition fuel to the future economy is one very obvious way of doing that while producing far less greenhouse gas emissions than by relying on coal. Unfortunately, countries like China and India have a very substantial reliance on coal, much of it quite dirty coal, producing very substantial CO 2 and other pollution emissions. It is important that we see the transition of these economies to a gas based economy. However, we also have to be sure that Australia does not pay the price for that. We will be contributing to significant greenhouse gas abatement throughout the world if the world uses our gas, and other LNG gas producers' gas, in its energy production facilities. Australia should not be penalised for that, as we will be at the moment. We should, in fact, be congratulated by the rest of the world for making that gas available to them-almost rewarded in that context in the world environment for making that gas available for export-because it will replace fuels which are far worse. The use of our LNG throughout the world, particularly if countries like China and India, those emerging economies which are big users of energy, use our LNG for energy production, will ensure that the world has far less CO2 produced. Negotiations in the future about the international regimes which apply to greenhouse gas abatement must focus very much on ways of preventing carbon leakage. They must ensure that people do not close down energy intensive facilities in First World countries such as Australia and move them to developing countries where they are not subject to the same constraints as we would be in Australia, thereby gaining a competitive advantage for those industries but still producing even more CO 2, which will subject the world to a worse greenhouse problem. That is not an effective answer to the greenhouse issue. It can only be approached on a total planet basis and we have to be certain that any future negotiations take that into account. We cannot penalise developing countries for being developing countries; we have to assist them in the process of emerging into more energy efficient economies and de-linking their economies from carbon. That is a very significant trend which is taking place, because although world energy production is increasing and world economic growth is increasing, the carbon intensity of the global economy is actually declining. We are seeing a reduction in the amount of carbon produced because, to some extent, economies throughout the world are being de-linked from carbon. As we move into an information age, into an age when the economy is less dependent on carbon based energy and more based on knowledge industries, which Australia could playa pre-eminent part in, then we will see a decline in the amount of carbon required to produce a dollar of income and GDP throughout the world. Indeed, the decline of the carbon intensity of the world economy has been quite striking. We have seen nearly a halving in the number oftonnes per million US dollars of income since 1950. Back in the early 1950s, 239 tonnes of carbon was required to produce $US 1 million of income whereas now that is down to just over 150 tonnes in 1998. We have seen a very significant trend which I do not think has been adequately reported in the greenhouse debate and one which will have a significant impact on the way in which the world looks at greenhouse gas issues. 9278 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 August 1999 We must ensure in Australia that there is that trend towards an LNG based economy as a sensible transition fuel and that measures are taken immediately which will contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas production but which will not contribute to a reduction in Australia's economic base. Some of those industries, such as our pre-eminent lead in solar cell technology and the shift towards fuel cells which use energy in the form of hydrogen or natural gas which can be reformed into hydrogen and which then only produce water and energy as an output-fuel cell technology which can be up to 80 per cent efficient compared to 30 to 40 per cent efficiency for traditional coal-fired power stations-would make very significant contributions to Australia's economy while not contributing to the overall CO2 production. They are, in effect, the no regrets measures which we have already looked at. Conservation of energy is also a very important way of addressing that question. What is not worth doing is undermining our economic base in a knee-jerk reaction to the greenhouse gas problem. We also need to look very seriously and assist industry in any way we can in reinjecting the CO 2 into those underground basins which are vacated by the gas. The sequestration of CO 2 is important not just in the overall greenhouse gas issue but in the LNG industry where large underground caverns are available to reinject the CO2 which is produced as an unwanted by-product of the gas production itself. The North West Shelf operators are lucky in that their gas is relatively low in CO2 but, for example, the Gorgon Fields nearby are somewhat higher in CO2 If much of that CO2 could be reinjected or frozen and pumped to the sea floor where it would remain sequestered for many hundreds of years, that would make a significant contribution to the greenhouse friendliness of our LNG industry. I am disappointed that the government has not given much more support through research grants to these kinds of initiatives because they do offer real opportunities to sequester CO 2 and to increase the greenhouse friendliness of our LNG industry. I believe that, while government cannot do much to change the competitive position of our LNG industry by interfering directly in the market, it can, through the indirect measures of the fiscal and regulatory climate and the research facilities made available through the CRC program, for example, do a lot to ensure that our industry is more competitive and certainly more competitive on a CO2 basis. In conclusion, it is important to touch on one final topic and that is the fiscal regime which will apply. At the moment we are looking in this country at significant changes to the fiscal regime-the still secret Ralph committee report, much debated in the media but still actually secret, which potentially could strike at the heart of our LNG industry. The LNG industry is characterised by a very substantial up-front investment with a long-term payback period. The abolition of the accelerated depreciation provisions would obviously have very serious consequences for the LNG industry and, in particular, for the expansion of that industry which is currently contemplated in the north-west of Western Australia and in the Timor Gap. If the accelerated depreciation provisions are abolished that would have a very depressing effect on that market and I am sure that the probability of those investments going ahead would be significantly diminished. While I am not yet aware of the actual fmal terms of the Ralph committee report and while the opposition-as our Shadow Treasurer, Simon Crean, has indicated---does wish to cooperate in this area and seek to work constructively with the government in producing a beneficial outcome for Australia. So, from the perspective of one of our major resource industries, the LNG industry, I flag that the accelerated depreciation provisions are very important. Thursday, 26 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9279 I am aware that the mining industry is somewhat split on this question. The mature mining companies that are now making significant profits from older mining ventures obviously would have an interest in a lower tax rate and are less concerned about the accelerated depreciation provisions. We have to look to the future and to the importance of this LNG industry for the greenhouse gas transition, for the long-tenn value to this country of its exports, and also for the benefits which it can bring in tenns of GDP growth, export growth and skilled jobs throughout the Australian economy. Obviously, the accelerated depreciation provisions are most important. I put the government on notice that that is a very significant factor which we will take into account when assessing the Ralph committee report. The LNG industry, along with the petroleum industry which is generally supportive of this bill, and which I have not had much time to canvass today, certainly think the bill is a positive step forward in the transition to a more efficient and productive industry in the future. Obviously, the government has a number of issues which it must take into account in planning policy in this area for the future. The use of gas as a transition fuel is the most significant of those, and the government can support that initiative through an appropriate fiscal regime, regulatory regime, and through the international negotiations which are part of our greenhouse gas contribution. In conclusion, I again indicate our support for the legislation and for the non-controversial amendments which I understand the minister proposes to move at a later time. Ms MAY (McPherson) (10.26 a.m.}-As secretary of the Industry, Science, Resources, Sport and Tourism Committee, I speak today to endorse the government's amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 proposes amendments relating to improving government administration and the efficiency of exploration for, and production of, petroleum resources. These amendments do not constitute a significant change to the existing regime governing the operations of the petroleum industry in Australian offshore areas, but they are designed to achieve a more streamlined system for the administration of petroleum exploration and development in Australia's offshore waters and achieve greater certainty and security for companies which hold, or are seeking to apply for, petroleum titles in our nation's offshore waters. These changes are also designed to allow for a more flexible regime to accommodate the changes in offshore technology since the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act was introduced in 1967. Members here today may recall that last year the coalition government passed a small number of urgent amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. These amendments emerged following recommendations from a review of offshore petroleum legislation which ended in 1998. This review was conducted with a great deal of input from stakeholders in the petroleum industry and state and Northern Territory governments. Likewise, the amendments which we are discussing today have been drafted with input from the stakeholders. The federal government has worked extensively with these stakeholders on the provisions of the bill now before the House. Consequently, this bill incorporates many of the proposals generated through the review and, in effect, the industry is anticipating the introduction of these changes. What emerged from these discussions and the review process was the necessity to update the act to keep pace with changes in the petroleum industry. As we move into the 21st century 9280 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 August 1999 and the petroleum industry continues to go through a series of changes and developments, such as the opening up and growth of liquefied natural gas markets, a number of the provisions in the act of 1967 are no longer appropriate. Other provisions put unnecessary burdens on companies and government through their reporting requirements and approvals. This legislation currently before the House has the effect of improving government administration and promoting the efficiency of exploration for, and production of, petroleum resources. As Warren Entsch, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, said during the second reading speech for this bill, the government's vision for the future 'is one of a competitive, innovative and growing petroleum sector operating in a streamlined legislative framework that offers high levels of certainty to stakeholders and contributes to rising national prosperity.' This has been clearly identified and outlined in the government's objectives in the 1998 resources policy statement. The proposed amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 relate to improving government administration and the efficiency of exploration for, and the production of, petroleum resources. A number of these amendments are designed to bring the act up to date with the present day structure and characteristics of the petroleum industry, both economic and technological. The substantive new provisions in the bill include the introduction of infrastructure licences to provide for at-sea operations that do not fall strictly within the boundaries of current production or pipeline licences. I stress that, under these proposed changes, there will be no net impact on the Commonwealth budget, as the changes in no way impact on elements such as annual licence fees payable to the Commonwealth. In contrast the overall effect of the amendments is likely to be a reduction in administrative costs for both government and industry. This is good news for government and industry. Under the changes, there are four major provisions that the bill will insert into the act. These are: the repeal of two sections of the act to remove the discretionary 16-block provision; changes to the term of pipeline licences; the inclusion of infrastructure licences, a new class of title to provide secure title over processing, storage or off-loading facilities; and, provisions for the continued use of production facilities in lapsed licence areas, with the transfer of obligations to parties continuing to use the facilities. These changes are supported by key stakeholders, and follow the government's vision for a flexible industry with greater certainty. In general, the new provisions in the bill include the introduction of infrastructure licences to cater for at-sea operations that do not fall strictly within the ambit of current production or pipeline licences. An option is also introduced for the use of supplementary bids to decide between exploration permit bids that are ranked equal. Provisions that will be repealed by the amendments include the joint authority's discretion to fix the number of blocks for the renewals of exploration permits at 16, the fragmentation constraints on areas covered by permits being renewed and the 21-year term of pipeline licences. I want to take this opportunity to elaborate on one of the four major provisions I earlier identified-the changes to the term of pipeline licences. The government has agreed to repeal the 21-year term of pipeline licences. While the term is to be indefinite, the pipeline licence will be able to be terminated if there has been no work on or use of the pipeline for a period of at least five years. This move conforms with the change made last year to the term of production licences and will enhance the security of tenure and thereby encourage investment in pipelines. Thursday, 26 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9281 Another provision relates to infonnation that companies are required to submit to the government and its protection so that trade secrets are not betrayed and the submitter's competitive position is therefore not undennined. The existing safeguards involve gazettal of a notice to advise affected parties before any infonnation that is deemed to be an interpretation of basic geological data can be released to third parties. The bill introduces a streamlined system under which companies submitting information to the Commonwealth government will be able to declare at the time that they classify information to be confidential or derivative. Unless the designated authority challenges this declaration within a time period of 30 days, the classification will stand and the infonnation will be protected from release, pennanently if it is confidential or for five years if it is derivative. In a further protection measure, a new offenc-eliberate1y interfering with offshore petroleum installations or operations-will be introduced in these changes. This offence will carry a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, which is equal to the strongest penalty provision in the act. As mentioned earlier in this speech, the amendments proposed in this bill were the subject of in-depth consultation with the upstream petroleum industry. However, after the bill was introduced to parliament, industry members raised a number of points of ambiguity in the wording of provisions associated with the rights conferred by infrastructure licences. Unless rectified, this current wording would leave uncertainty in the licensing regime for petroleum exploration and development. The government has addressed these concerns raised by stakeholders through the development of amendments clarifying the intention of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. I point out that there is no financial impact of this new clause to clarify these provisions and the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association is in support of the action to remedy this situation. I would want to see the changes enacted immediately. It would be inappropriate to delay the implementation of the amendments currently proposed for several reasons. Firstly, the review process into the industry has been extensive and lengthy. Secondly, the industry has been given assurances that the recommendations will be acted upon. Thirdly, a number of amendments are critically important to the development of major projects within the industry. If they were not implemented, this would have a potentially adverse effect on the economy. I commend this bill to the House. Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 as presented and I support the flagged technical amendments proposed to be moved by the government. On this side, I follow the contribution from the member for Bonython, the shadow minister for resources, who has made his usual intellectually erudite and substantive contribution. I had the opportunity of hearing that and I endorse everything he had to say. I thought that, as a West Australian interested in things petroleum upstream and offshore, I might make some general comments about the importance of the petroleum resources industry, particularly for Western Australia but also nationally. As has been mentioned, today the one thousandth cargo is leaving Karratha from the electorate of Kalgoorlie, whose member is here. That sees 10 years of successful LNG exports from Western Australia and Australia. Every cargo has been delivered on time to the complete satisfaction of the customer in Japan. In addition to those substantial long-tenn contracts to Japan, we have seen about 48 spot cargoes to different countries over the last few years. The",123,Representatives Main Committee
178,Mr Stephen Smith (Perth) (10.35 A.m.},"I support the Petroleum (Submerged Lands)9282 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 August 1999 introduction of spot cargoes reflects some of the changes we have seen in the international liquefied natural gas industry. The provisions of this bill arose out of the review into the offshore petroleum legislation. I recall that in 1997 some earlier provisions were passed which were dealt with on an urgent basis because they were seen as being important to buttressing the confidence of the North West Shelf joint venture in its attempt to secure further contracts from Japan to enable the expansion of the North West Shelf operation. The letters from Japan have not yet arrived as a consequence of a range of things. The joint venture partners remain assiduous in that task, as do other liquefied natural gas venturersGorgon or Liquefied Natural Gas Australia, for example-in pursuing other projects and other markets, particularly Korea, China, Japan and Taiwan. I raise the earlier piece of legislation, which was picked up out of the review and dealt with on an urgent basis. Whilst it was a very small measure, it reflected the long standing bipartisan support which the liquefied natural gas industry has had. The industry has been in place for over 10 years. It was Peter Walsh under a Labor government who signed the original export approvals for the contracts. It has been a project that has had bipartisan support. On our side, both in government and in opposition, we continue to support the existence and the expansion of Australia's great liquefied natural gas industry, from small things like changing our policy on export controls over the spot contracts to the large things like taking seriously accelerated depreciation and its importance to a large capital intensive industry. The importance of the liquefied natural gas industry in particular and the upstream and offshore petroleum resources industry to Western Australia is worth noting. Australia's petroleum resources industry is massively underappreciated, with great respect to my colleagues, by the parliament and it is massively underappreciated by the community at large. In 1997-98 the gross value of production of the upstream oil and gas industry was $8.9 billion, of which nearly $5 billion was produced in and offshore of Western Australia. The industry's net exports bring in over $1 billion annually to the economy. A recent economic study commissioned by the Western Australian Department of Resources Development and APPEA-the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Associationidentified over 900 companies in Western Australia providing goods and services to the industry. These companies employ over 17,000 people, in addition to the over 2,500 employed directly by the 23 oil and gas companies active in Western Australia. The regional impacts of the industry are significant, with virtually all oil and gas produced from remote locations onshore or offshore, something which I am sure the member for Kalgoorlie will personally attest to when he makes his contribution. I thought it might be worthwhile to read into the record some of the conclusions of that Western Australian Department of Resources Development study to which I have just referred. That report shows that the value of Westem Australia's oil and gas production has grown 12.5 per cent per year since 1990. It delivers $230 million in revenue annually to the Western Australian government in royalties. It accounts for more than half of Australia's crude oil and condensate production and 10 per cent of the world's liquefied natural gas trade. More than $21 billion has been invested in the Western Australian industry over the past 18 years. The report calculates that that is over $3 million per day. The annual value of production in Western Australia now exceeds $5 billion. The value of that production is greater than the value of all agricultural production. It is more than triple Thursday, 26 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9283 the value of the largest single agricultural commodity-wheat. The petroleum sector is now more than 13 times the size of the fishing industry and exceeds the total value of the forestry sector by a factor of 12. They are the most significant direct and indirect economic, employment and regional development benefits that you find from that particular study. I mentioned in passing earlier the question of accelerated depreciation. This will fall, obviously, for substantive consideration when the government and the parliament come to consider the Ralph review outcome. On the basis of my conversations with people in the industry in Western Australia, there is no doubt that the Western Australian petroleum resources industry is extremely concerned about uncertainties about the future climate for investment arising from the Ralph review. It appears entirely possible that the investment settings for new investment in oil and gas exploration and development might end up being less favourable than at present, and that is as a consequence of consideration being given to the accelerated depreciation arrangements. I noticed that Woodside Petroleum, through its Managing Director, Mr Akehurst, formally released in the last month or so a paper entitled, 'Tax reform, depreciation and large, long life projects', which crystallised the importance of accelerated depreciation for the liquefied natural gas industry in terms of Australia's international competitiveness as a place for capital investment in long-life projects. In addition to that particular issue, there are a number of other issues which are relevant to the petroleum resources industry which are of concern and consternation to the industry. One in particular is the immediate deductibility of exploration expenses. If you look at exploration in petroleum resources industries, the potential downward turn is nothing to compare with the downward slide that you see in the minerals resources industry. But if you take into account the collapse in crude oil prices about six months ago, which, from memory, was the lowest in real terms in about 25 years, that caused the industry to constrain and cut costs. Inevitably, one of the things which is cut is exploration budgets. Prices for oil have now substantially recovered, but the industry is obviously always concerned and nervous about the oil price cycle. In the last calendar year, 1998, as I understand the statistics, new records were set for exploration wells offshore and for overall oil and gas production. In this calendar year, while production should remain high, exploration expenditure is likely to be plateaued or muted or depressed. So there is a real issue here, in the context of the Ralph review, about the immediate deductibility of exploration. This is nothing like the difficulties for exploration in the minerals resources area, which-I will not digress too much-have seen the gold industry in Western Australia making proposals for changes to the taxation arrangements which might act as incentives for investment in minerals resources exploration. When we bear in mind that exploration for gold continues to be about 60 per cent of the whole exploration basket in Australia, the difficulties which the gold sector has had in recent years are of considerable concern. There is a live issue here for the national interest. This goes to a great exporting industry, it goes to regional development, it goes to economic growth and prosperity in an outlying state and it goes to direct and indirect employment benefits. The member for Bonython ranged quite extensively over the greenhouse gas issue. I would simply make this point. It seems to me that it is in our national interest, and consistent with being a good international citizen, that our attitude to greenhouse gases ought to be, firstly, to identify and accept that there is an issue there and a genuine cause for concern, and that 9284 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 August 1999 we do need to act responsibly and take appropriate steps. But that, in my view, is in the context of understanding that with greenhouse abatement you have to act locally but think globally. While it is the case that the production of liquefied natural gas, for example, can cause production of greenhouse gases, it is also the case that there is unquestionably a net global benefit in greenhouse gas terms if you take into account that the further export of liquefied natural gas to Japan, India, Taiwan or China would almost certainly be taking these countries partly off the coal drip. So, while it is certainly appropriate that we act responsibly locally through a whole range of greenhouse gas abatement measures, it is in our national interest to ensure that the international community operates on the basis of thinking locally but acting globally. We ought to ensure that there is a credit given for the export of our energy-rich resources which have an ultimate net beneficial global effect. A final point which is worth mentioning in passing, so far as the petroleum resources industry is concerned, is that I detect just a modest amount of uncertainty and consternation as a result of the recent passage by the coalition of the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Democrats of the environmental diversity legislation. I suspect there is a bit more water to go under the bridge in the implementation of that legislation and in ascertaining its impacts. But this is the Main Committee: I will not become too pejorative. On this side we are becoming just a little bit accustomed to the broader, unholy coalition alliance of Liberals, Nationals and Democrats giving us GSTs or industrial relations reform, so-called, wave 1 or wave 2-but I will not digress too far, Madam Deputy Speaker. This is an important industry for my state of Western Australia and for our nation. We are dealing with important exporting industries and it is important that small but effective measures like these are dealt with on a bipartisan basis to ensure certainty for the industry. It is equally important that, when we come to consider the aftermath of the business taxation review, the national interest which resides in this great exporting industry is kept well and truly to the fore. Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 were passed. These were the result of recommendations from a review of offshore petroleum legislation. However these amendments were the forerunners to the larger number of important proposals to amend the act that were recommended in the review. The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 now before the House incorporates all of these important proposals. In recent years it has become evident that, among the provisions in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act, some are no longer appropriate while others place unnecessary burdens on both companies and government regarding reporting and approval requirements. With the ever-changing technological climate in the petroleum industry and the developments in the liquefied natural gas markets, we need to ensure that the legislation promotes the government's objectives as specified in the 1998 resources policy statement. The government's view is towards a dynamic, competitive and growing petroleum industry, facilitated by a streamlined legislative framework that offers high levels of certainty to stakeholders, contributing to improved national prosperity. Within this framework the proposed amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act aim to develop and improve the government's ability to effectively administer and provide for efficient exploration and production of petroleum resources. The stated goal is to accomplish this without compromising",131,Representatives Main Committee
179,Mr Haase (Kalgoorlie) (Lo.49 A.m.),"In 1998, a handful of urgent amendments to theThursday, 26 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9285 operating safety and environmental standards. While there are no sweeping changes in the legislation, the more significant changes will deliver on this commitment. Four new insertions into the act include, firstly, pre-exploration. Where interested parties submit competitive bids for exploration permits, supplementary bids may be called for as a tiebreaker for submissions that are rated as equal. With this additional option comes additional incentives for each company to invest in more exploration and expenditure. Secondly, we are also introducing a new class of title, an infrastructure licence, designed to provide for the at-sea operations that do not fall strictly within the current production or pipeline licences. Often companies are unwilling to outlay large sums of money in processing plants unless they have security over title on the area in which the plant is to be located. This new infrastructure licence will allow companies to remotely control some operations for the recovery of petroleum in an area when the petroleum is located in an adjacent production licence area, thereby enabling them to connect subsea completion from the infrastructure licence area into an adjacent production licence area. Notably, the current regulations governing acceptable oil field practice, including health, safety and environmental protection, will have equal weight in regard to the infrastructure licences. The infrastructure licence will also provide continued access to facilities after petroleum production has ended in production licence areas. Another new provision to go into the act relates to information required of companies upon submission to government and the protection of that information to preclude the leaking of trade secrets, thereby ensuring that, the competitive position of the submitting company is not undermined. The current safeguards involve gazettal of a notice to advise those parties involved prior to any information deemed an interpretation of basic geological information being released to a third party. These amendments now allow a streamlining of the system whereby companies that submit information to the government will be able to declare at any time that they classify the information as confidential and derivative. A designated authority may challenge this within 30 days, otherwise the classification will hold and the information remains protected from exposure-permanently, if it is confidential, or for five years if it is derivative. The introduction of a new offence, that of deliberately interfering with offshore petroleum installations or operations, will mean that those found guilty of such an offence will face a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, which is equivalent to the harshest penalty within the act. If we look at those aspects of the legislation which will be repealed as a result of the amendments, the most obvious is the removal of the joint authority'S discretionary powers to fix the number of blocks for renewals of exploration permits to 16. It is the very objective of the exploration permit system to facilitate the maximum amount of investment in petroleum exploration in offshore areas. One of the key mechanisms within the legislation to attain this is the necessity that a permit holder surrender half the blocks covered by the permit at renewal, allowing these areas to be released again for exploration by other interested parties. What we have now, at the joint authority'S discretion, is holders of exploration permits retaining up to 16 blocks where the halving process would otherwise result in fewer blocks being included in the renewed permit. This practice has become the mainstay of the industry, resulting in large areas being retained by companies for extended periods, with a consequent reduction in areas becoming available for competitive bidding. So the discretionary maximum 9286 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 August 1999 of 16 blocks for new pennits is removed by the amendments, with the discretion for existing pennits removed after renewal for the next pennit tenn. Upon a pennit area being reduced to the point where the halving fonnula allows renewal over just four blocks, the pennit can be renewed twice over these blocks, rather than a fourblock renewal and then a two-block renewal. A single block pennit will not be able to be renewed. Another repeal provision pertains to the fragmentation constraints on areas covered by pennits being renewed. Currently, every exploration pennit area has to consist of aggregates of at least 16 blocks, except in cases where the total holding is less than 16 blocks. Furthermore, each area is to be comprised of blocks having a side in common with at least one other block. This is regarded as outdated, due to modem exploration techniques allowing explorers to more accurately hone targets. The repealing of these constraints will foster greater attraction of pennits given that the company can retain more targets it regards as prospective. We also agreed with the repealing of the 21-year term of pipeline licences. The tenn is to be indefinite. However, if no work has been done on the pipeline or been ensuing during that time, the licence will be able to be tenninated subject to force majeure. This fits with the change made a year ago to the tenn of production licences and will enhance security of tenure, and thereby will foster greater investment in pipelines. Ever evolving technological change is the factor underpinning the provisions being repealed, with the goal to incorporate them in regulations. The more technically prescriptive provisions are, the more quickly they become outdated. So it makes good sense to put such provisions in regulations where they can more readily be amended without having to make cumbersome and time consuming changes to legislation. The provisions in question will be repealed only when the regulations are ready to come into effect. This is why a subset of amendments is to come into being at a date to be fixed. Numerous minor machinery amendments are also required to update the act to present-day legal and administrative practices. Specifically, this relates to the removal of the necessity for companies to use approved fonns, converting pecuniary penalties in the act to penalty units and deleting provisions relating to offences that are fully dealt with elsewhere. The member for Perth made mention of the fact that the electorate of Kalgoorlie encompasses one of the most significant offshore petroleum exploration areas in Australia. He has made no mistake there, and my association over 20 years with the town of Karratha puts me in good stead to comment on the significance of Woodside Petroleum and others to the national wealth of Australia. I was in the Karratha township when Woodside Petroleum and their partners invested some $13 billion, making it the largest project ever attempted in Australia. The impact on the town of Karratha was enonnous. The population in the area swelled to 15,000 at one stage during construction. Of course the numbers involved in the operation at Woodside today have been greatly reduced. This has been caused in the main by technical efficiencies and automation. But one of the major reasons for a reduction in population in the immediate Karratha area has been the introduction of the effects of fringe benefits tax on the companies employing in that area. The introduction of the fringe benefits tax has in no small way contributed to the practice of 'fly in fly out' in the Pilbara generally and throughout the mining industries in Western Australia. It is a very sad day that many smaller communities are being destroyed by the fact that those communities no longer have a pennanent population. It is that reason, the destruction Thursday, 26 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9287 of the community's soul in towns, that has motivated me to press most strongly for the removal of the insidious effects of fringe benefits tax. Much has been made of the cleanliness of LNG as an energy source. We know full well that, of all the petroleum products and hydrocarbon fuels, LNG is the cleanest at its point of use and sale. There are moves afoot to penalise Australia, specifically Western Australia, for the fact that it contributes so much in hydrocarbon fuel to the rest of the world-specifically the market in Japan and the expanding market in Asia. There is one great opportunity for us to address those penalties being imposed for exporting this hydrocarbon fuel, and that is the development of tidal energy. We currently have the opportunity in north-western Australia in the Kimberley region-Derby to be specific-to develop the largest tidal facility for power generation in the Southern Hemisphere. It is with great enthusiasm that I personally pursue the backing of this particular project by the federal government and the utilisation of funding that has been mooted by discussions between the coalition government and the Democrats in this place to make provision for renewable energy production and to assist financially in the establishment of plants that will facilitate that. There is much to be said for LNG as a fuel but we accept that, even though it is the cleanest of hydrocarbon fuels, it is still not the answer to the long-term effect of greenhouse gases on the world environment. There will be a great future for petroleum companies operating offshore from Western Australia. The amendments to this legislation will allow a greater facilitation of exploration licences, and the changes have been initiated with a simpler and more transparent process in mind. There will be no impact on the Commonwealth government, as the changes in no way impact on elements such as annual licence fees payable to the Commonwealth. These fees will apply to pipeline licences and infrastructure licences with indefinite terms of effect as much as they would if the terms were limited. In fact, the net effect of the amendments is likely to be reduced administrative costs for both government and industry. It is with this in mind that I commend these amendments to the House. Amendment Bill 1999 will bring about a streamlining of the administrative processes relating to petroleum exploration and development with a view to facilitating further exploration and development of the nation's petroleum resources. For that reason, I and the Labor opposition support the bill. We agree with the objective of increasing the nation's total exploration and development effort in the petroleum area. When I saw this bill listed on the Notice Paper, I decided to take the opportunity to speak on it. It gives me some sense of satisfaction to see a continued streamlining of the arrangements for the exploration and development of petroleum resources in Australia. I say that because my first experience of parliament was in the Old Parliament House when I had just finished a PhD at the Australian National University on the subject of resource rent tax. I was under the supervision of Professor Ross Gamaut and had a rather unique opportunity to finish the academic side of the work and then work for the newly elected Labor government in implementing the resource rent tax. Initially, we sought to introduce it on both onshore and offshore petroleum resources and also on mineral resources, but it soon became evident that the states were not interested in that and were unwilling to cooperate because, strictly, they had jurisdiction in relation to onshore resources. So we moved quickly to looking at the application of tax to offshore",134,Representatives Main Committee
180,Mr Emerson (Rankin) (11.04 A.m.},"-The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Legislation9288 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 August 1999 petroleum development. The Bass Strait operators at the time-the partners, Esso and BHPsaid that they were not interested and objected strongly to it. The North West Shelf operators sought to be excluded from the rent taxation regime, and we understood the reasons for that, so it was effectively applied in greenfield offshore developments. In my new capacity as a member of parliament, I want to pay tribute to some of the officials-and I see that there are officials here; you are most welcome-who were involved in the former Department of Resources and Energy and also in Treasury. They are: the late Alan Woods, head of the former Department of Resources and Energy; Mr Bernie Fraser, a Treasury official who was on secondment to the former Department of Resources and Energy and who went on to greater heights to become Secretary to the Treasury and then Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia; Mr Dennis Ives; Mr Jim Starkey; John Daly; Pat Ryan; Alan Smart; and Mike Hitchens. One way or another, they were all involved in this challenging exercise of developing and applying a resource rent tax regime to offshore petroleum development. I was satisfied, in my new capacity as a small businessman two years ago running a firm called Eco Managers, to pick up a report that was produced by Bankers Trust. It analysed the fiscal regime for offshore petroleum development in Australia and came to the conclusion that this fiscal regime had contributed greatly to making Australia, in the judgment of the report, the most prospective area for petroleum development in the world, taking into account both the geological prospectivity and the fiscal regime. The resource rent tax was introduced in the mid-1980s and has withstood the test of time. There have been a few modifications, and that is why I welcome the changes today. They amount to a further streamlining and facilitation of investment, and they are good and welcome amendments. The idea of the regime was to put in place a taxation system that would be stable over time-and it has proven to be stable over time. There is nothing worse for investors than to have tax arrangements that are affecting them changed year after year, and that is precisely what happened during the late 1970s and very early 1980s with the crude oil levy. The government of the day would have a look at the oil price that year, have a discussion with the explorers and particularly the developers in Bass Strait and basically negotiate on a year by year basis the fiscal regime for the petroleum industry. That gave no certainty and no predictability to the industry. The resource rent tax was introduced to achieve that objective and, at the same time, to gain for consolidated revenue, for the people of Australia, a reasonable share of any significantly large profits that were being generated by the petroleum industry. The theory and the practice was to couple that so-called conditional tax-that is, a tax that is conditional on the actual profitability of a project-with a cash bidding system. The then Labor government also introduced that second componentthe cash bidding system-a little bit later. I understand that that has also been reasonably successful. Some of the amendments that are before the parliament today achieve a further streamlining of the cash bidding arrangements, and I support that. The Prime Minister was in the parliament a couple of weeks ago saying that Labor introduced a number of important economic reforms during the 1980s and that the then coalition opposition supported those reforms. That is not strictly true. It did support a number of them, but one of the reforms that Labor introduced during the 1980s was the resource rent tax and the cash bidding system and the coalition opposed them very strongly through the Thursday, 26 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9289 House of Representatives and the Senate. There is a little bit of selective memory there on , the part of the Prime Minister in saying that the coalition supported these major refonns. I consider that this was a major refonn. It has helped the petroleum industry quite a lot. It has helped the taxpayers of Australia in that the resource rent tax is now collecting very substantial amounts of revenue and it has withstood the test of time in being stable. Interestingly, not too long after we introduced the resource rent tax for offshore petroleum development, the operators at Barrow Island in Western Australia, which is within the jurisdiction of the state of Western Australia, came to us and said they would not mind having a look at that sort of concept for Barrow Island. After some very sensible and mature negotiations, we also achieved an outcome there which was one of those classic win-win situations. The problem was that the Barrow Island oilfields were depleting and, under the excise royalty regimes that were in place at that time, it was not worthwhile for the operators to continue so they asked tq go to this profits based regime. We negotiated those arrangements and, as a result, I understand that Barrow Island is still producing today to the benefit of the company and the taxpayers of Australia, so it was a classic win-win situation. A few years later the operators of Bass Strait came to us. They had had a bit of a rethink about their strong opposition to the resource rent tax in 1984 and said that they would be interested in discussing the application of that regime to Bass Strait after all. Again, after some fairly lengthy but mature negotiations, the same results as on Barrow Island were achieved. Oil and gas fields are now producing which would have been shut in some considerable time ago if those successful negotiations had not occurred. The final point I would like to make is in relation to the future of the petroleum irfdustry in Australia in the context of the Ralph review. I accept a point that has been made by the gas or petroleum industry in general. Chris Murphy from Econtech has been commissioned to do some work on the impact of the GST regime-the ANTS package---on the petroleum sector because very soon, as a parliament, we are going to be looking at the impact of possibly removing accelerated depreciation. The point that the industry makes is that it is possible that Mr Murphy has not taken into account the fact that there is a 40 per cent rent tax in the petroleum industry and therefore the cost reducing impacts of the GST-and there are some cost reducing impacts of the GST on the petroleum sector-will be ameliorated or clawed back to a significant extent by the 40 per cent rent tax. So what the government giveth, it then taketh away. I would not like to see for a moment the government responding to that and saying, 'Okay, we take that point and we will reduce the resource rent tax on petroleum.' That is not the way to go. However, I think the industry does have a point here. Therefore, when the parliament comes to consider the question of the Ralph review and the possibility of removing accelerated depreciation, the parliament should appreciate that the benefits to the petroleum industry from the GST arrangements will not necessarily be as large as those initially claimed by the government. I know there are a lot of members on both sides of the parliament who are quite concerned about the idea of an exchange involving the removal of, or a reduction in, accelerated depreciation in return for a lower company tax rate. We need to be sure of the net effect of all the arrangements-those that have just come in the fonn of the so-called ANTS package, and the new arrangements in terms of the Ralph review. We need to be sure of the total impact 9290 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 August 1999 , of that on the petroleum industry and on other resource industries. I am concerned that the removal or significant slowing of accelerated depreciation could be really quite detrimental to those industries. I will close by saying that I do get a sense of satisfaction out of debating this bill today. It does enjoy bipartisan support. We find ourselves in the enjoyable situation where amendments have been put forward that streamline the regulations and the administrative arrangements for the petroleum industry in Australia, and we fully support those provisions. and Resources) (11.17 a.m.)-in reply-Firstly, I would like to thank all of those members who contributed to this debate this morning on the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. When you look at the members who participated they include the members for Perth and KalgoorIie in Western Australia, two members who acknowledged the significance of the offshore oilood gas industry in that state. We had also the members for Rankin and McPherson in Queensland, again acknowledging the value and the significance of that industry in the state of Queensland. And, of course, there was the member for Bonython in South Australia who has also contributed to the debate. Having said that, the debate certainly acknowledged the very real value of offshore oil and gas, and the need to get it right. The debate also highlighted the spirit of cooperation that was working through this process to get this bill into this place and get that support here. I would also like to echo the words of the member for Rankin by acknowledging the contribution of the advisers and officials who were involved in the process. On behalf of the government I woulq certainly like to thank them very much for their support and contribution in making this happen. It certainly would not have happened without that contribution. I would like to say that everybody has made useful comments. With the support of the industry, the proposed amendments will make the legislation far more workable and much clearer. The amendments proposed in the bill were subject to in-depth consultation with the upstream petroleum industry before their introduction. However, after the bill was introduced, industry members re-examined the proposed amendments and raised a number of points of ambiguity in the wording of provisions dealing with the rights conferred by infrastructure licences. Accordingly, the government decided to move a small number of amendments and insert one new clause to clarify those provisions. Unless rectified, the current wording for these parts of the bill would leave uncertainty in the licensing regime for petroleum exploration and development. This could mean that rights conferred by an infrastructure licence could be more limited than intended. In addition, various ancillary activities currently permitted under a production licence could be disallowed unless the infrastructure licence were held as well. Since these supplementary amendments introduced no policy change from the original intention of the biII,""'they will have no financial impact over and above what is envisaged in the bill. However, failure to address these points could prove administratively costly to both government and industry. I commend these amendments to honourable members and present the supplementary explanatory memorandum. Question resolved in the affirmative.

182,Amendments (By Mr Entsch),"by leave-agreed to:9292 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 August 1999 Motion (by Mr Entsch) proposed: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Child Abuse Ms ELLIS (Canberra) (11.22 a.m.)-I want to bring to the attention of members the work and the dedication of a very special organisation. Advocates for the Survivors of Child Abuse or ASCA, as it is commonly known, was formed in 1992. While only a young organisation, ASCA now has state branches across the country. ASCA is a community based non-profit national organisation whose members advocate support, dignity and respect for all victims or survivors-however they see themselves-{)f child abuse. ASCA members comprise survivors, parents, friends, partners, professionals and all non-abusive members of the community who share the belief that child abuse must stop. Let us look at some statistics on child abuse. It is now reported that one in four girls and one in 11 boys are sexually abused by the time they reach the age of 18 years. More than 150,000 children under 17 years of age in Queensland alone have been sexually abused and an estimated 420,000 Queenslanders over the age of 18 are survivors of sexual abuse. I am using those statistics because they come from a Childrens Commission of Queensland report from an inquiry into paedophilia, dated 5 August 1997. Close to 70 per cent of psychiatric patients are known to have been sexually abused as children. Forty to 60 per cent of women in care suffering depression, phobias, obsessive compulsive disorder, personality disorders and schizophrenia have probably been the victims of significant sexual abuse as children. Eighty-five per cent of sexually abused children are harmed by someone they know and trust. That is the biggest tragedy of it all, I would suggest. ASCA aims to break the silence on child abuse, provide support, advocate understanding and promote increased education and research. Very recently-on Tuesday, 17 August-ASCA had their second annual White Balloon Day as a means of emphasising their work and letting the community know that they are there to assist. I had a great deal of pleasure in helping to launch the White Balloon Day here in Canberra. I believe the greatest value of the work of ASCA can be measured in two specific ways: firstly, to let those people out there who may have suffered abuse in their past know that there is a group to whom they can turn; secondly-and, in a way, maybe even more importantly-by talking openly about child abuse ASCA throws a spotlight on the subject now. Hopefully, people who may have fears or suspicions of abusive behaviour around them would be encouraged to speak out or seek advice, or even just think about what they may be able to do now, so that the abuse could actually stop now, earlier in the life cycle of that child. I had the privilege a while back of launching a pretty amazing publication called Breaking the silence: survivors of child abuse speak out, co-edited by Liz Mullinar. This book contains the words of many people who have managed to 'survive' earlier trauma and who are now able to support others. I thoroughly recommend the book to interested members. It is a really good light into the life of someone who has come through a tunnel in their life called child abuse. On a more local note, I want to place on record my thanks for the introduction to ASCA and the inspiration that I have received as a member of parliament from Wendy Stamp, a local community woman here in the ACT who has been the prime source of energy in Canberra Thursday, 26 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9293 for furthering the work of ASCA. The courage and detennination displayed by Wendy and, I might add, supported so strongly by all those people connected by ASCA, I can only admire. To Wendy and to her helper, to Liz Mullinar and to all those associated, particularly their families and friends, I know all members of this place will join me in congratulating them and encouraging them to keep up their dedication and hard work, particularly when we think of the impact that they can have. Our children now and our children of the future can hopefully only benefit from the work that people who belong to ASCA undertake and carry out on a daily basis. In conclusion, I encourage members of this place to look a little further into ASCA and see if there is a way within their own local area that they can offer some support. The organisation held their first conference, called a national conference, here in Canberra last year. It was very good to see the success that they got from that. The courage that these people have in having been subject to abuse as children and in coming out and supporting others needs to be applauded by everyone. (Time expired) Bluey Day remarks in relation to ASCA. I do join with her in congratulating ASCA and particularly Liz Mullinar for the work that they do in the area of child sexual abuse. Earlier this week I spoke in this place on a very serious matter. As many members of the coalition would already be aware, last Thursday night I was arrested at the Tea Tree Plaza shopping centre at Modbury, in my electorate of Makin. I was handcuffed and thrown into a specially constructed gaol cell for the evening, charged with loitering with intent to raise funds for Bluey Day-that is, cancer research for kids-but refusing to have my head shaved for this most worthy cause. The organisers of this event decided in their wisdom that, because of my status as a politician, they would probably raise more money by asking members of the public to donate to keep me behind bars rather than have me released, which they promptly did. AndI can report to the House that donate they did. During my stay in the gaol cell, Mr Peter Rogers, from 42nd Street Cafe at Tea Tree Plaza, not only had his head and moustache shaved to raise money for kids with cancer but also volunteered to have his legs waxed-in full view of the public. Of course, never having had his legs waxed before, he did not know what to expect. The beautician decided that it was an opportunity to experiment in torture techniques-that is, what the effect would be if she waxed very slowly or sometimes quickly. Volunteers from the crowd were asked to participate in the process of shaving Mr Rogers's head, which many of Peter's customers did with glee. My arresting officer offered to release me for a short time so that I might have the opportunity to have a go, so to speak. It was interesting to note that once I actually had the shaver in my hand, Mr Peter Rogers immediately declared that at the last federal election he had voted for me. He also declared to the large crowd assembled that I was a wonderful, hard working member of parliament for the constituents of Makin. I responded by thanking him and reassuring him that I had very good skills in this area, as I had often had to shave very delicate areas while I was a theatre nurse in the Navy, as well as having learnt to shear sheep in my youth. However, I did ask if anybody would be willing to donate more money if I accidentally shaved off an ear or two. The only way that the police would agree to release me from gaol would be that I first matched the public donations raised that night-over $2,000. I got on the phone immediately",141,Representatives Main Committee

I would like to take this opportunity to thank not only the members of the public who supported Mr Peter Rogers in raising money for kids with cancer, but also Peter's family and many friends. I thank also all of my coalition colleagues, Liberal and National Party members, who not only supported a very worthy cause but also supported my release from gaol. I appreciate it very much and I can assure all the members it is much appreciated by the children who have cancer. Sometimes members of the public feel that members of parliament are too busy to care about things other than their immediate constituency or parliamentary work, but I would like to assure the electorates in Australia that politicians do care about a wide range of issues, particularly those affecting children and families. May I thank all of my coalition colleagues for their generous support for research for kids with cancer. Vanuatu and Fiji: Population Planning and Community Development with colleagues who are also members of the all-party group on population and development, to participate in a study tour of the Pacific on population and development issues. This was made possible through funding by the Packard Foundation and arranged by the Reproductive Health Alliance. Originally we had planned to visit the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji, but civil unrest in the Solomon Islands meant the cancellation of this leg. We did visit Vanuatu and Fiji. During our time in Vanuatu we saw many projects around Port Vila; we also travelled to Espiritu Santo island, where we again saw many impressive projects being carried out at low cost. As well as meeting many of the local people, we had the opportunity of meeting, on three separate occasions, the Prime Minister of Vanuatu. We also met the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Finance, the Leader of the Opposition and the Speaker of the Vanuatu parliament. Through the Australian High Commissioner, Mr Perry Head, I was privileged to present, on behalf of the Australian parliament, a selection of books to the Speaker for the Vanuatu parliamentary library. There are many challenges regarding population issues in Vanuatu. Our trip was particularly enriched by the presence of Dr Gunasagaran Gounder, Assistant Minister for Health, of Fiji; the Hon. Iarris Naunun, of Vanuatu; and the Hon. Albert Loare, of the Solomon Islands. The adviser to the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, Reproductive Health and Family Planning also accompanied us throughout the trip. In Vanuatu, members of the group were surprised that basic education was provided by the government for children basically only up to the age of 12. At the end of primary schooling, only 20 per cent of children go on to secondary schooling. The cost is borne by the family. This inevitably leads to too many children having too much time on their hands. The massive distances and isolation of most of the island population makes education a particular challenge. We were very impressed with the Vanuatu projects and particularly impressed with the work of AusAID. There were very innovative projects through theatre and dance companies, which we were privileged to see. Indeed, we witnessed the beginning of a program on AIDS which is especially important in Vanuatu as many young men spend many months abroad as",143,Representatives Main Committee

I did get the impression in respect of AIDS that Vanuatu is very much in denial mode. Until Vanuatu faces the reality of the AIDS issue, it is going to be increasingly difficult for the country. The Australian High Commission, the High Commissioner, the High Commission staff, and especially AusAID staff, worked hard for us to see not only the successes but also the challenges facing the people. We came away with a better appreciation, particularly of the way Australian money is being spent on various programs. Much is being done with a small amount of money. The group also visited Fiji. Fiji, as honourable members will know, is more developed than Vanuatu. We were particularly fortunate to have travelling with us Dr Gunasagaran Gounder, Assistant Minister for Health of Fiji. We also met the Minister for Health and from a personal point of view I was pleased to renew my personal acquaintance with the Speaker of the Fijian parliament, Dr Apenisa Kurisaquila, who has taken such a leadership role on popUlation and development issues not only in Fiji but generally within the South Pacific. With the change of government in Fiji, we were especially fortunate to meet with several of the new Fiji ministers, including the Minister for Women, Culture and Social Welfare, the Hon. Lavenia Padarath. We also visited the Fiji School of Nursing where each head within the school gave us a synopsis of activities and programs. Such is the excellent training at the School of Nursing, that graduates are sought after and many do not return to Fiji, instead going to work in Australia and the UK. Low wages and poor working conditions are stumbling blocks to keeping graduates. This is a real problem for Fiji, and a similar problem with graduates from the Fiji School of Medicine. The nurses were appreciative of Australian aid but asked for shorter courses to be funded. In Fiji we were shown and given a copy of a video, Staying the Course, which provided a good overview of the work done in the Pacific community by the UN Population Fund. There seemed a greater awareness of the threat of AIDS in Fiji and Vanuatu. The only non-positive note was that, on the day after we left Fiji, the plane on which we were aboard 24 hours earlier had crashed, with the loss of all life including two Australian aid workers. This was a tragic event. Our special thanks goes to Larry Baldwin from the Australian Reproductive Health Alliance who accompanied the group throughout the trip. We were particularly impressed with some of the women's groups, the women's rights movement and crisis centre which we saw in Fiji.

I will give you two examples: one is from a company, Lip-air Proprietary Ltd, that operates out of the Torres Strait. You would be well aware of the problems some months ago when CASA decided to change some regulations over there with regard to registering RPT-registered passenger transportoperations.

185,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science9296 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 26 August 1999 requirement to do so, but they decided that they would commit themselves to this particular type of operation and they approached CASA for assistance. They were told, given it was their first time, to take their time and work through the process properly. Unfortunately, it has just dragged on and on and, clearly, you have to question the competency of some of the officials there. Lip-air have had check and training manuals put in and left for weeks and weeks at a time before they were checked. Even though the manuals had been written by very competent and experienced companies like Exec Air, they came back with a whole range of associated problems adding to the delaying tactics. The maintenance control manual was submitted before 20 July and they are still waiting for advice on that. They are basically being told that it will be attended to when CASA gets around to it. I have spoken to both Laurie Foley and Rob Elder to try to get some assistance on this matter. We managed to get some extensions of time, but these people have still had absolutely no contact made whatsoever. As a consequence, these people are slowly going broke. CASA officials are saying, 'It's too hard,' or 'We're too busy and there's nothing we can do.' The two officers sent to the Torres Strait to assist in this project have since been reunited with their families in Canberra. There has been nobody else sent up there. As a consequence, these guys are sitting around fiddling their thumbs-and I am talking about the operators of Lip-air-with absolutely no chance of getting it done in that time. That is one example. I have another one here-Nighthawk Design. They are an innovative company that was going to do night aerial advertising activities. For over a year, they have been applying for an AOC. It is interesting that, when you apply for an AOC through CASA, the applicant, first of all, has to nominate that he either owns or is leasing an aircraft. So you have to buy one first. Once you have bought that aircraft, you apply for the AOC. A year later, the aircraft is still sitting on the ground. In spite of a whole range of things, they have said, 'It's not an important one; it's not a priority, so we're not going to get around to doing it.' The arrogance of CASA was highlighted by the response to an email that was sent to Clinton McKenzie, a CASA official here in Canberra, which raised these concerns and said, 'These guys are going broke.' His response, when he emailed back, was, 'I got a particularly good laugh from your conspiracies below.' This was said by a public servant to somebody who is going broke: 'I got a particularly good laugh from your conspiracies below.' He threw the whole thing off as a conspiracy theory. These poor people have been sitting there for over a year, trying to get an aircraft into the air and they are being told, 'It's not a priority. We don't know what date we're going to do it for you. It's too hard, so go away and when we're ready, we'll come back and see you.' Every sector of the aviation industry in Far North Queensland has clearly indicated to me that CASA's routine in business up there has just come to a halt. They are not doing anything anymore. The other matter is that they are going from one flying operation inspector to another. Nearly every time, the ground for change is that the officers are on stress leave-one after another after another. These poor people are going broke up there, with absolutely no way in the world to get their aeroplanes off the ground. They have families to feed as well. If these people are not capable of doing the job, they should be moved on and they should get somebody who can do the job. (Time expired) Thursday, 26 August 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 9297 Second Sydney Airport: Badgerys Creek government to take action in building the second Sydney Airport at Badgerys Creek. It has been acknowledged since 1946 that Sydney needs a second airport. Since 1985, the site has been chosen. There has been study after study; millions and millions of dollars have been spent on EISs, including fake ones and red herrings such as Holsworthy, and every study shows the same: Sydney does need a second airport, and Badgerys Creek is the preferred site. The government has had an EIS on this site, on top of an EIS done under the Labor government. The EIS has effectively given the project a tick yet again. However, there is still no government action. There is a debate within the government once again. Why have an EIS if, when it gives its approval, the government does not say 'Okay'? Why was $12 million spent on the EIS? Badgerys Creek airport will be good for jobs in Western Sydney. It will be good for infrastructure provision in terms of public transport links for Sydney as a whole. It is necessary if Sydney, New South Wales and Australia are to continue to have growth. It is necessary in terms of equity considerations. There are 840,000 people within 10 kilometres of Kingsford Smith Airport. Around the Badgerys Creek area, there are 18,000 people. And those 18,000 people have known about this. There is a big sign out there saying, 'This is the site of Sydney's second airport.' It has been there since 1985-for 14 years. But governments of both political persuasions have failed to take action. One of the tragedies in this nation is the failure of governments to have vision in regard to infrastructure projects. Major infrastructure projects cost money, but they have benefits in the long term. If there had been this same mentality 50 years ago, we would have no Snowy Mountains scheme and we would have no major infrastructure projects in this nation. The real issue is expenditure. I am pleased that there are National Party members in the House today, because they should be telling their leader that the real prospect of the Fahey-Costello plan to push regionals out of Sydney Airport into Bankstown is that it will destroy regional and rural New South Wales. it is unacceptable, because rural mayors are writing to the government saying, 'Who do you represent?' Why is it that we will have regionals in Bankstown, jet movements-international and domestic, full on, full scale-at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport over the most densely populated area of Australia and an expansion also of Richmond air base? You will have Richmond, Bankstown and Kingsford Smith airports. You will not be able to use the east-west runway at Kingsford Smith because it will run into the airspace of Bankstown. You will have planes over the whole of Sydney. I have seen the people who are opposed to this project on television. On Saturday night, on the Channel9 news, there were three spokespeople: one opponent was the head of Fairfield Residents Against Aircraft Noise who admitted that his group has eight members; the second was John Dale who lives at Camperdown in my electorate; and the third was Ian Fraser who lives at Petersham in my electorate.

188,Mr Albanese,"It will be the fmal straw and I am pleased that the member opposite says9298 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 26 August 1999 The fact is there are some legitimate concerns about the environment around Badgerys Creek. Australian Labor Party policy and I very clearly said that if the EIS said it should not go ahead, then we would not support it. The EIS has said it should go ahead. What we need is a debate about making sure that the environmental considerations are taken into account and people are protected wherever they live, either around Badgerys Creek or around Kingsford Smith Airport. (Time expired) Ovine Johnes Disease Ovine Johnes Disease proposal. The New South Wales state government continues to destroy the Australian businesses on which the wool, sheepmeat and live sheep export industries rely through its actions related to the control of Ovine Johnes Disease. Due to this obvious and continuing failure on the part of the New South Wales state government bureaucrats, statutory powers vested in the states specifically for the control of notifiable and other transmittable diseases have been ignored in favour of pressuring the fanners and their veterinarians into common law agreements. This has removed safeguards and protection available under statute from fanners and their veterinarians, leaving them open to arrogant and clearly nonsensical directions from the state. The extraordinary conduct of the state government means that retribution or punishment is feared by many people who might otherwise give evidence. These individuals face the complete loss and destruction of their fann and business or, in the case of veterinarians, a loss of the right to practice. There are also a number of senior staff in the department who will only give evidence if they are protected from victimisation and harassment in their place of employment. Considering all these factors and after investigating the questions that I will relay to you now, I can see why a full judicial inquiry with the powers of a royal commission is the only answer to this exhausting fiasco. How and why did the New South Wales Department of Agriculture come to demand signed agreements from fanners under threat of punitive action when there existed an obligation to administer and enforce the Stock Diseases Act and other specific legislation? Given that it was policy by the department to pressure fanners into a contract which could be enforced without reference to the scientific rigour demanded in the application of the Stock Diseases Act, did the department then develop policy on the run, changing the agreements every time another ejection was raised? Did the department target fanners who had no history of OID and who would, therefore, fall outside the Stock Diseases Act, on the basis of unproven and scientific associations such as being a neighbour to a fann which did have OID, or having purchased sheep from a fann which many years later was shown to have OID? Did the department change the status of properties without consultation and a visit by the Rural Lands Protection Board veterinarian, or the private veterinary practitioner and the receipt of a written report from these experts? Given that the department had given itself the power to coerce fanners into agreements and enforced testing programs, did it advise the fanners of their options and the consequence of any action the fanner might take including the need to obtain independent veterinary and legal advice; the impact of a positive OID finding on the long-term capital value of the land; the risks associated with using other species such as cattle to clean OID lands; and the appeal",147,Representatives Main Commitiee
189,Mr Schultz (Hume) (11. 48 A.m.},"I rise once again on the debacle which is called theThursday, 26 August 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9299 processes available to the fanner and the impact a signed agreement might have on future appeals and compensation claims? Did the department require all veterinary practitioners to sign an agreement which demanded the veterinarian not criticise those administering the scheme? Why did the department not use the provisions of the Veterinary Surgeons Act but rely upon contract to extract such enforced silence from the profession which would be expected to protect fanners from the administrative excesses of government? Did the department advise fanners that when they were using an accredited veterinarian they were using a veterinarian who had agreed not to criticise the department? Did the department take action against those accredited practitioners who were encouraging fanners to become tested without properly cautioning such farmers about the long-term consequences of being diagnosed as OJD positive? What action did the department take to prevent certain practices profiting from the misery of poorly advised fanners? What legislative powers were used to enable the New South Wales government to cede its endemic disease responsibilities for OJD to the Australian Animal Health Council? Since the AAHC is a corporation which has decided to place itself under the laws of the ACT, does this render the New South Wales fanner and veterinarian subject to a quasi government national corporation under the jurisdiction of the ACT? What happens when a New South Wales fanner wishes to appeal a decision? What happens when a New South Wales farmer wishes to claim compensation? What happens when a New South Wales veterinarian wishes to sue for payment? Every time. I read through these questions and every time. I receive a telephone call or correspondence from another suffering, financially ruined family, I remind myself of how important a judiciary inquiry is in relation to this terrible disease, OJD. I feel like I am banging my head against a very large bureaucratic brick wall. I agree with various shires from within the electorate of Hume that a full investigation into all aspects of this calamity is the only answer. I have said it in the past, and I will say it again; while we toss around options about the handling of the administration of OJD, more families suffer. This suffering needs to end.
