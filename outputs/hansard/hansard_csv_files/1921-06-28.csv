I Will Make Inquiries And Advise The Honor","able member. for Trade and Customs whether it is a fact that the Government intend to grant a rebate of £20 per ton on all sugar purchased by jam manufacturers from Australian stocks. If so will the difference between the price so paid and the price paid by householders have to be made up by the general body of consumers? stated in the honourable member's question. An agreement has been made that the jam manufacturers in respect of jam for export purposes only shall be allowed to import their own sugar for which they, of course, will'pay whatever happens.to be the world's market price at the time. Owing to the fact that the manufacturers have on hand large stocks of pulp, and that it would take some time to make the necessary financial arrangements, as well aB to get the sugar here, it bas been agreed that the .Government shall lend to them for the time being certain stocks of sugar, and that they shall pay for that sugar the f u l l market price. On their exporting the jam i u which this sugar is used, however, they will be given a rebate of £20 per. ton. When they get their imported sugar they are to replace ton forton and quality for quality, whatever sugar we lend them in that' way. 3 p.m., range -that the proposed Bill to amend the Customs Aot shall' be introduced as speedily as possible, and carried to the second-reading stage, so' that we may have his explanation of the principles of the measure a few days before the consideration of the Tariff is concluded ia Comthe measure, closer examination.'. than would be possible if ihe BiU were not introduced until we had completed the consideration of the Tariff? member refers to the Bills to whioh I have made reference more than once in the course of the Tariff debate.

In addition to that, the Oommonwealth has from time to time made advances to the various States to enable -diem to carry out this programme in anticipation of recoupment. ' The New South Wales Government, during the present, financial year, -has been advanced for these purposes over £2,000,000..

On Thursday we agreed to increase the duty on undressed timber in sizes of 12 inches x 6 inches from Is. to 4s., but the Minister( Mr Greene) now proposes to increase the duty on undressed timber in sizes of 7 inches x 2J inches and upwards, and less than 12 inches x 6 inches only from 3s. to 4s. 6d., whereas if the proportion were maintained in accordance with the previous increase the duty would be 12s. f have received telegrams from those who are engaged in the timber industry and secretaries of labour leagues and other bodies, pointing out that three-fourths of the mills in my electorate are idle, and that there is very little hope of their working until they are given a satisfactory Tariff. closed for the winter months. reasons for the closing of these mills. I am simply pointing out whab has .occurred, and I want to know, whether the Minister considers that the increase he proposes on this smaller size of timber is in fair proportion to the increase agreed upon by the Committee last week. for Trade and Customs) [3.24] -Thes e are fixed and not ad valorem duties, and the difference between them bears relation to the various stages of manufacture. Presuming the base is right, all we require to do is to raise the duty as we pass along from one stage of manufacture to another. When we looked into this matter we found that the difference between Is. and 3s. under the old Tariff represented rather more in the way of protection than was required for the partis oular progressive stage of manufacture. Therefore, in suggesting this increase, we have fixed upon 6d. less than the difference shown. That is to say, instead for Trade and Customs) [3.32] of making the increase 2s. we are making no reason why the practice alluded to by it Is. 6d. The proposed duty is slightly the honourable member is not followed in higher than the present rate, b u t is proevery State, except, I presume, that the portionately lower than the increase sawmillers have not taken the necessary agreed to on the rougher timber last action or asked -for the necessary arrangeweek. There is not the slightest doubt that this increase will add considerably to the cost of building homes and do a great deal of in j u ry to the country. I cannot conceive how it can be argued that oregon can come into competition with our hardwoods. The person who wants hardwoods will use them. If oregon or other softwood timber is required, it will be used. These increased duties on timber will press very heavily on the BrokenH ill mines. Apparently the only object the Government have in view is to secure additional revenue. The increase cannot be justified on any other ground. As there is a go=d deal of waste in cutting up a log, I would like to know if sufficient allowance has been made to the millers to balance that less? 1 ample for this stage of manufacture. the Minister. ( Mr Greene) has consulted expert millers about the matter? They have assured me that there is a big difference between the capacity of a log and We all know the the output of the m ill. I want to see as much local labour used as possible. Seeing that there is so much waste in logs, perhaps it would be as well for us to allow them tp come in free of duty. [3.30] I trust that the Minister( Mr. Greene) can tell us why so much timber is sawn in bond in New South Wales? This practice has some distinct advantages, and it is not a new one, for it has been in operation for many years. I wish to know why it does not apply in a l l the States. WiU the Minister also tell us something about the enormous combines which are controlling the Australian timber trade to the detriment of the public ? I have heard a good deal about this matter since we adjourned last week, and from what I gather, they are the most injurious combines, from a publio point of view, in any of the industries in Australia. -There is ments to be made.",23,Public Service Appointments

There is nothing to prevent exactly the same arrangements being carried out in all the States, and duty paid on the sawn or dressed timber actually sent out, plus a certain percentageI think 30 per cent. I speak from recollection, and subject to correction, for I have not had an opportunity to consult my officers. there is no percentage. on the point, for just at the moment there is no departmental officer here. Later on, however, I shall tell the Committee exactly what the position is. As to the second matter referred to, my feeling is that, taking the sawmillers by and large, throughout the country, there are no combines, but when the timber gets into the hands of the city merchants operate before that. that then there may be combines. I have no certain information on either point; but comparing, as I have had the opportunity of doing, the list of prices at the mills at which the timber is sold to the distributers in the city with the prices charged tb the public, I am inclined to think that the balance is w it h the distributers in the city, and not the other way. distribution to the people are in many cases arranged before the timber leaves the mills. that is' so or not ; b u t I do know there is a big disparity, and to me an inexplicable disparity, between the prices at which the miller in the country sells to the city merchant, and the price at which the city merchant sells to the public. There may be good reason for that disparity, but it is a very remarkable one. that it costs as much to actually deliver bread as j t does to grow the wheat and produce the bread ? that one of the greatest economic problems is the cost of distribution. If any man could devise a scheme acceptable to the community, under which that cost could proclaim h i m a statesman. should like a word of explanation on one or two points. When we were considering the previous sub-item we were in favour of imr&ediate protection, but not in favour of the duties proposed in the amendment of the Minister( Mr Greene). Since then I have had an opportunity to consider the amendment now proposed, and I think -that a compromise could have been ' effected on the previous item with a duty ""of 3s. in each column, which would have shown a f a i r comparison. In regard to the dressing of timber in bond, has the Minister's advisers informed h i m as to what is the percentage allowed for waste? The Minister spoke of 30 per cent., and I think there is something wrong, about --that. for Trade and Customs) [ 3 . 3 8 ] I was wrong in regard to that percentage. I have since had an opportunity to consult I am inclined to think my officers,, and I find that importers are allowed to take the timber into bond, there saw it , and then pay duty on the actual amount of sawn and dressed tim ber sent out. But the difference between the amount which they take into bond and the amount which they clear must not be less than a certain percentage of the amount which they take in . Suppose, for example, that 1,000 feet of timber be taken into bond, and in the sawing or dressing of that there is a loss of 25 per cent I do not know the actual percentage-then , presuming the percentage which the Department allows for waste to be 20 per cent., and that the importers I do not know whether send out 75 per cent, or 750 feet of the 1,000 feet, they w ill be charged duty on 800 feet, and not on 750 feet. which is applicable to timber in the log, or that applicable to sawn timber? the matter quite clear.

I am afraid, however, that, like their loyalty, it is largely a matter of mere l i p talk. In every other country proper atten^ tion has been paid to the timber industry. Several European countries have gone in for reafforestation, realizing that the timber industry is a key industry, and that adequate timber supplies are absolutely essential. Here we have hardly started to scratch the ground in connection with We know what we axe doing in reafforestation. We should increase these duties, and show the State Governments, together with the Commonwealth Government, that reafforestation is absolutely necessary, so that we may make f u l l use of our. own timbers. There are some honourable members who would p u t I ask the. every item on the free list, and I am waiting to hear what they will have to say in regard to my proposed increase.

87,I Admit That He Has Offeied Mr Hector Lamond ( I L L A WA R R A ),"help the saw-miller, who to-day .is able to produce timber at a price immensely lower than that at which the consumer has to purchase it . It emphasizes again the futility of the high increases of which we .approved the other day, and, still further, the futility of the amendment we are now discussing, as a means of setting going once more the saw-mills in the electorate of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton). I -think that honourable member is paying rather too much atteution to the unemployed in the saw-mills. He is overlooking the fact that for one man who is unemployed in the sawmills to-day there are many unemployed in the building trades, and that every shilling we add to the cost of the raw material of the builder is going, not only to throw out more men in the building trades, but. as it does so, to throw more and more saw-millers out of employment. We have focussed our attention too much upon the fact that at present there are mauy saw-mills unemployed, aud have failed to look for the reason. We ar© assuming that the reason is something that can be cured by a higher duty, whereas the fact is altogether the reverse. It may be possible to start some of these saw-mills again by reducing' the cost of timber to the consumer, but none of them will be started by any increase in cost that this Tariff may place on the product of the industry. It may be that the Tariff will not prevent the erection of houses, but if we are to accept the amendment now before us, and to add to the estimated increased costs which the Minister placed before us last week a still greater increase, it will not He possible to build a house of any size under £900 or £1,000. It will be necessary to secure still higher wages for the workers of this country before they oan afford to carry *the increased burden which this Parliament is placing upon them in the way of house rent or the cost of building. In New South Wales only houses erected some years ago are available for renting to-day. The unfortunate toiler who wants to start a home for himself will spend many weary week? wandering about Sydney trying to find a house to let, and then, if he turns, as many have done, to building, he will find that a house which cost £600 a while age, and which he could finance at that price, is to-day eosting £900, £1,000, or even more. I know people in the city of Sydney who for months have heen hunting for houses containing five or six rooms, for which they are prepared to pay £1,100 or £1,200 each, but who are unable to find them. member think they would be able to get houses with greater ease if there were no duties on timber? Mi-. HECTOR LAMOND They would get them for less if the price of timber was not as high as it is to-day. I do not say that if we took off the duties on timber they would obtain suitable houses for less, but that the imposition of these increased duties will not help them to get houses. duties, would houses be cheaper? duty were taken off oregon to-day they would get houses for less. The timber trade in our State is controlled by the men who own the forests there, and not by the merchants who sell the timber.

The evil lies really in the monopoly of the sources of supply. correct so far as a great part of New South Wales is concerned. The honorable member has been entirely misinformed..

Assuming that it is 15s. per 100 super, feet, builder, carpenter, or bricklayer, that that shows that the people who own timber lands in Queensland, outside the control of 'the State Government, are able to impose a tax of 15s. per 100 super, feet in excess of the actual value of the timber itself. timber as you want for an export duty of Is. per 100 feet. New South Wales man who owns timber in Queensland desires to bring it to New South Wales, he has to pay Is per 100 feet export duty on his own material; but I am talking of the Government royalty, and not the amount illegally charged for the transfer of timber from one State to another. I have stood on public platforms beside honourable members opposite when they denounced in the most scathing terms the iniquity of royalties charged on coal in England.' I do not know anything worse in connection with the English coal royalties than the royalty imposed on timber by the Labour Government in Queensland. But instead of hearing a denunciation of that impost by the Government upon timber in certain parts, and by private owners in other parts, of that State, we are implored to help a struggling industry by putting a further tax on the houses ef the working people. The proposed duty is not justified by any of the facts that confront us to-day; the existence of this monopoly is proved by every fact that has been adduced before the Committee. mately, twice as much as we ought to pay for the timber to be put into the houses, that the people are anxious to get but cannot get because the cost of building is too dear. We would be better employed, in trying to give cheap houses to the people instead of piling up dutieson imported, timber. I am .told that the War Service Homes Commissioner claimed that he could produce timber at half the price at which he could get it from the Combine before he started his saw-milling enterprises in. Queensland. by anybody in the trade, be he the timber employed in a house "" to. day is a heavy item of the expenditure, and we have no right to permit a monopoly to take toll of the people in this way. I shall not support any increased duty on imported timbers, and I do not know get as much that anything we may do by means of the Tariff will have any effect upon the unemployment in the timber-cutting trade to-day. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) referred to the big increase in the imports of timber during 1920. What was ""the reason for the increase? In New South Wales, twice as many houses were built in 1920 as during 1919. What has happened in the timber trade has happened also in the soft goods and every other importing trade. The importers received delivery at the end of the war of three years'supplies which they had not expected to get while the war continued. During 1920 immense quantities of timber were delivered which the merchants would have been very glad not to have received. They naturally made contracts for supplies on the supposition that the conditions, which, according to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, explain away the case put up by the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Story), would continue. They could not get delivery of their orders, and so they ordered much more than they required; but delivery commenced as soon as the war was over and freights were available, and the merchants now have in their yards immense We are paying, approxiquantities of timber that they do not require for the current year.

The State Housing Boardi n New South Wales has been launching out in the building 'of homes, and the Victorian Savings Bank has been embarking on the same policy. current year are below normal because the accumulated orders of previous years have been delivered and merchants are not ordering further supplies. The importers have acquired more than their ordinary stocks' and they must quit them before they oan resume importing. is to the advantage of those who pay rent that the timbers hitherto used in' house construction should be available. I have heard ho arguments that would justify me in believing that any duties imposed on imported timbers will do anything to solve the unemployment of people in the timber-cutting industry. Here is another fact to be taken into account: Australia will not continue to build houses at the same rate as in 1920. When the soldiers were returning in thousands and asking to be set up in homes, an endeavour was made to meet this abnormal demand. This Parliament launched out On"" the building of War Service Homes, involving an estimated expenditure of £30,000,000. Saw-mills were set in operation all over the country and industries were started in the expectation that that money would be expended in a very few years. The Commission has accumulated vast quantities of timber, and it would be better for the soldiers if it had not done so but had finished the houses that had been started instead of importing huge quantities of material for future construction. whole of the facts, as far as I can understand them, -show that the conditions of unemployment in the timber-cutting trade are not due to any trouble that the Tariff can cure, and any effort to remedy the disease by increasing the Tariff will merely make it worse. have never heard a more exaggerated statement of the facts than that to which we have just listened' by. the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond). I do not say that he has w i l f u l l y misrepresented the true state of affairs, but he has been misled. . He has complained of the existence of a huge Combine. If there is a Combinei n his own Statei-and I do not deny it-h e should not reflect on other States that have no Combine. The Combinei n New South Wales consists of the importers who w ill not support Australian production, but are clamouring for the introduction of timber from overseas. According to The importations for the to-day's Argus, the imports of timber for the ten months ended A p r i l ; 1920, were valued at £1,996,566, as against £4,531,281 for the ten months ended A p r i l , 1921. That timber is imported mainly into States that have no sympathy with the other States which produce timIt ber. In Queensland the mills are closing down, and every timber merchant's yard is f u l l of timber of a quality as good as that of any that is imported. Because there is a Combine of timber importers in New South Wales the honourable member for Hlawarra would support them in the outrageous action' of importing material from overseas to the amount of £4,500,000 in ten months, when we have in Australia sufficient timber for all requirements and our mills are closing down for lack of orders. The timber that is being i m ported is not as good as that produced locally. If oregon is considered superior for some special work, let it be imported for that; but to shut down our local timber industry that is of such importance to northern New South Wales and Queensland in order to suit the requirements of a Combine of importers, is an outrage. I cannot understand why such an appeal should be made to this Committee. Even the increase of d u ty proposed by the M in ister ( Mr Greene) w ill not be sufficient to deter the Combinef r o m importing foreign timber. member denied that there was a Combine. able member's allegation regarding the existence of a Combine at the source of supply. The honourable member also referred to the Government charging a royalty of £1 per ton.

Unfortunately, there is a great deal of truth in the statement of the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) that the cost of building is nearly double what it was prior to the war; but any one listening to the honourable member would come to the conclusion that this was due to the operation of the present Tariff. How often must honourable members be reminded of the fact that the price of almost everything is now nearly double what it was in pre-war time ? Let us look at the facts. This Tariff has been in operation for fifteen months, and the only duty placed on oregon during that period has been Is. per 100 super, feet.

Yet honourable members would l»ad the public to believe .that a small increase in -the duty on soft woods will considerably increase the price of building -these cottages. The duty has'been imposed for the purpose of protecting Australian timbers, not to enable their price to be increased, as honourable members would have the public believe, but because oregon, having come down so quickly in price, is being imported in huge quantities in an endeavour to supplant the use of Australian hardwoods. The proposed increase in the duty will make it less possible for this oregon to -come into competition with the product of our own people. It does not follow that the price of local timber will be raised. It may be dustry. In any case, we are promised excessive price to the consumer.

We have the information that oregon has come down considerably in price, and is being rushed into the .country as fast as possible. It is our duty to see that our own people are not thrown idle, and if that can be accomplished without additional cost to those who build houses, the proposition before us is' a fair one. Personally, I do not think that one penny will be added to the cost of building.. that argument is that the present price of hardwood is so low as not to give a fair return to those engaged in the industry. basis of my argument; I submit that in consequence of oregon coming in at a much lower price, people are led to prefer it ; and, indeed, some prefer it even if it is a little dearer than our own wood at the time. I think t h a i if we could get to t h e ' bottom of the position, it would be found that where oregon is used in the place of hardwood, it really costs more, but some people prefer to patronize industries outside Australia. TheW ar Service Homes are quite another matter. They are provided for , inasmuch as the Government have made arrangements to work their own forests. also using a good deal of imported tim ber. but in the future the timber required for these homes will come from the Government forests. this timber is now being used very rapidly; in fact, some of the Government mills in Queensland have been closed owing to the enormous stacks of timber on hand. We must deal with this question quite apart from the W a r ServiceT h a t is quite Homes, always keeping in view' the in terests of Australia as a whole. endeavour to avoid reiterating the arguI get wires from ments I used last Thursday when advocating a duty on timber. We then decided to place duties of 3s. and 4s. on oregon, square, 12 inches by 6 inches, and I have no doubt that the proposal of the Minister( Mr Greene) is in ratio with that decision. I wish, however, to say a word or two in reply to the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond). That honourable member argues that the duty proposed by the Minister w ill not in any way assist the local saw-mills which are closed to-day; and I am afraid that, so far, he is correct'. The reason for the saw-mills being closed tovday has already been given by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton), namely, that there are such enormous stacks of imported timber here that there is no .demand for the local product. The honourable member for Illawarra has also timber, no building is going on, and that if we impose a higher duty the price w ill increase proportionately. There is assuredly a big margin for a reduction in T h a t is not the the price of imported timber. As the Minister has said, there is a large disparity also between 'the price paid to the miller and the price charged"" by the merchanta disparity which the honourable gentleman finds it hard to understand. If the argument of the honourable member for Illawarra is correct, it is also a. very good argument why the price of timber should be reduced, and not increased; it goes to show that an increase in the duty should not, at any rate, make any difference to the cost of building. I should like to say one word in regard to royalties. Certain honourable members have repeatedly, said that the State GovernGovernment are ments are making undue profits in consequence of the excessive royalties they charge. I do not"" intend to discuss a T h a t is so now, subject of which I know nothing, beyond the conditions prevailing in Tasmania; but I can certainly say that the royalties I understand that charged 'by the Tasmanian Government are in no way excessive or responsible for the high price of timber torday.

As a matter of fact, imported timber is not used in Tasmaniaf or building purposes, or, at any rate, only to a very small extent, and it is quite evident that if our saw-mills are closed down, as the majority are closed to-day., we shall be dependent on the imported article, which in Tasmania, if not elsewhere, is regarded as not nearly so good as the local product. In a climate like that of Tasmania soft weatherboards are not durable'. It w ill be clearly seen, therefore, that if Tasmanian saw-mills are compelled to close,, the builder must be faced with an increase in the price of timber. I am firmly convinced of that fact, or I should not be supporting the proposal of the Minister to give what he considers fair protection to the industry. I repeat that, in my opinion, the protection we are proposing will be insufficient to bring about a resumption of the milling trade, but, of course, our Tariff is not to operate for this year alone. Twelve months hence, or when we have to some extent used up the large importations now on hand, there wil l be a resumption of the milling industry. The Tariff is going to be of some benefit to tha millers ultimately, but I am afraid the proposed duty is not sufficient to help them materially at the moment. We have already decided in the case of the 12 inches by 6 inches timber what protection we are going to afford, and I shall support the Minister's proposal. I am afraid that the honourable miember for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) has no chance of carrying his amendment; and I trust that the same ratio of protection as was decided in the case of the 12 inches by 6 inches timber will be carried right through the division. should like the Minister( Mr Greene) to reconsider the position in regard to the allowance made in the case of logs cut in bond.

My statistics show, therefore, that present importations are not abnormal. We have our own hardwoods, and they are used for special purposes,; but I hope our people w ill realize the real importance and value of these timbers, and w ill put them to steadily greater and more varied use. I am looking forward to a great export market, more expansive even than that which I Australia enjoyed for her hardwood timbers some years ago. It is a responsibility of the State Government, and, to some extent, no doubt, of the Eederal Legislature, to assist and encourage reafforestation. I read an article only recently which pointed out that oregons, redwoods, and the best softwoods generally could be grown in Australia. I quoted in this chamber some days ago an article from the PacificM a i l , which stated that of the thousands of millions of superficial feet cut in the United States of America, the average of exports was had nothing to do less than 5 per cent., and that the greatest percentage during many years was less",34,Lamond Th E Basis Of Said That Because Of The High Price Of

I think, however, that we shall regain our export markets. In 1914-15, we imported about 60,000,000 superficial feet of timber, dressed, n.e.i. With a duty, that an attempt is being made to insist that of 30 per cent -whic h means about 5s. per 100 feet-the total amount secured by the Government from .that particular line of duty alone, taking the imports to be the same, would be £150,000. The total of laths imported in 1914-15 was 18,000,000 feet; and, at the rate of .10s. per 100, that line would bring in revenue amount-, ing to £90,000. Logs amounting to 10,000,000 feet were imported in 1914-15. At a rate of duty equivalent to Is. per 100 super, feet, the revenue would derive £5,000. New Zealand-in 1914-15 the importations totalled 60,000,000 feet-takin g the duty to be Is. per 100 feet, there would be added to the revenue the sum of £30,000. not otherwise enumerated, the duty being 4s. 6d. per 100 feet, and the importations totalling S5,000,000 feet, there would be an addition of revenue amounting to £191,000. On lines not otherwise enumerated, the importations of which in 1914-15 were 107,000,000 superficial feet, the revenue derived from a 4s. 6d. rate of duty would be £240,000. Thus, upon those six items alone, a total revenue of £736,000 would be gained if our importations were equal to those of six years ago. extreme revenue Tariff. While I have been quite prepared to concur iu the duties originally imposed-and more for revenue reasons than for any otherI cannot agree that any further increases are justified. [5.0] -Honorabl e members have been arguing for nearly two hours along the same lines as last week, namely, that these rates of duty are intended to be imposed in opposition to the interests of the Australiau timber industry. I say, ""Nothing of the kind."" I shall read a communication from one of the leading timber merchants in Australia, who handles Australian woods in a big way. Here are his comments on last week's debate :At the outset, we would mention that we do not decry the Australian-grown timber, but strongly support its use and sale; and our support to the local article is recognised by all large producers in Tasmania and Queensland, and is evidenced by the large stocks we hold of the timbers from these States. But we feel Australia is able to produce all the timber she needs, and while there are those who give the matter careful attention and discount these assurances, yet higher duties are being urged because of this assumed possibility. Wherever duties are imposed, softwood timbers for building purposes will have to be imported, and any increases in Tariff necessarily increase the already high cost of building. Australia. merchant is a Victorian, and his stateUpon timber imported from ments will be borne out by nearly all the men in the trade throughout Australia. They correspond with the views expressed by representatives of the trade, almost without exception,-before the Tariff ComUpon undressed timber, mission a few years ago. The present proposal, which represents an increase of 300 per cent, in respect of oregon compared with the rates introduced by the Minister( Mr Greene), amounts to an additional heavy burden on the people. My correspondent proceeds to point out that if the rates are increased upon other lines in accordance with those already agreed to in respect of timbers, the added cost involved in building a four-roomed cottage, including the items of flooring, weatherboards, and lining, would be £15 5s. 9d.; I look upon this as an while the extra cost of building a fiveroomed cottage would be £18 4s. 8d I appeal even to the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) not to vote for these increased duties.

Already thousands engaged in the timber industry, including many bush workers, who are one of the best classes that we have in Australia, are out of employment. Bush workers believe in decentralization, and are prepared to go into the backwoods and on our mountain sides to earn a living. We are endangering their employment. When a saw-mill closes, the timber worker and his family have to move elsewhere. The worker in the bush is quite as worthy of consideration as is the worker in our cities, and in dealing w i th this item, we have to consider not merely the saw-nrill proprietors, but the men. employed by them.

It is of far-reaching importance, because Australia has not anything like the timber supplies that it is represented as having I believe that Australia is one of the most productive 6 countries in the world ; take any other country of the same area, and you will not find one that has as small an area of truly waste country as has Australia For production of all kinds, and in all the requirements of men, there is"" no country on the face of the globe that excels Australia. That is a plain statement which no man who knows the Commonwealth can deny. But timber is one of the country's weaknesses, as I shall show by statistics showing the percentage of timber lands to total area in some of the leading countries of the world : Australia, 5.36; New Zealand, 25.63; TJnited Kingdom, 3.82; France, 18.65; Algeria, 2,98; Germany, 25.90; Switzerland, 20.60; Italy, 15.92; Hungary, 29.30; Roumania, 21.36; Sweden, 52.20; Norway, 21.50. TJnited States of America, 24.08; Canada, 17.34; Cape Colony, .19; British India, 22.85; Japan, 48.33; Austria, 31.66. strand of wctol was grown in Australia. grown almost anywhere in Australia, and the clip can be taken off every year, but it is not everywhere that timber can be grown, and even where it can be grown it takes from forty to sixty years to mature. relatively small percentage of wooded lands to total area do not state the whole case, because some of the other countries I have quoted have d'one a lot of their developmental .work. Many of them have large areas of stone quarries, but in Australia we do not use our stone to any extent, because stone dwellings are too costly, and not altogether suitable to this climate. All our developmental work is ahead of us, and yet we amongsb the poorest timbered countries in the world. [380 ] a good deal about Australia, and w i th my knowledge of its potentialities, I have to confess that timber is one of its weaknesses, as the statistics prove. tistics i from the Commonwealt h T ear-Book. I desire to show why it is necessary for Australia to make the best use of its timbers. Australian timbers are not as useful for some purposes as are others, and are too valuable to use where other timbers can take their place. Oregon often takes-the place of the local timber to the advantage of both, for not only is oregon a better timber to use in certain classes of work, b ut it enables people to erect a better balanced building and to make better use of all their materials. Hearing some honourable members talk, one would think that Austalia's supplies of timber were inexhaustible-that we had not only all the timber we require, but can supply other countries I have a table of statistics showing the quantity of timber, cut in the Commonwealth for the years 1908to 1918, the quantity of undressed timber imported, and the quantity exported. In the year 19 OS the quantity of timber cut Russiai n Europe, .39; in the Commonwealth was 489,051,000 super, feet, and in 1918 440,952,000 super, feet. It w ill be observed that in the decennial period the quantity of timber cut in the Commonwealth did not one time not a diminish to any extent, but the quantity of undressed timber imported decreased The wool can be from 267,047,561 feet in 1908 to 169,675,000 feet in 1918. Tbat shows that we are not importing anything like bhe quantity of timber we used to import. People have begun to realize that a great deal of the local timber can be used in The statistics showing our places where previously they thought it could not be used. We have been discovering the capabilities of the local article, and we are now using it at a much greater rate than we are growing it . Consequently a danger exists, and it is growing, that we shall consume' all our -timber before we*have had time to replace it . member understood the practical conI have travelled ditions of development in this country he",38,Lamond Th E Basis Of Said That Because Of The High Price Of

This talk ahout the folly of. burning off our timber when our . transport conditions are in their present state is a mere beating of the air. If it w ill not pay a man to cut the timber on his land and send it to market, it is essential that he should burn, it ; and u n t i l our transport problems have been solved we must go on burning it . In 1908 Australia exported 145,954,000 cubic feet of timber, and in 1918 only. 19,509,000 feet. It seems to me evident that Australia cannot supply its requirements, because in the ten years' period we have barely maintained the quantity of timber cut, and have considerably decreased the exports. If we had the enormous timber resources which some honourable members from Queensland think we possess, we would be able to not only maintain our own consumption, but to increase onr export trade. Mr C'OKSBE -We have not fche vessels for export. sels for export during the war, and we are not likely to have them for years to come if this Committee continues.to .deal with the T a r i ff as it has been doing.

When I was passing through CanadaI saw a street section in Vancouver which had been laid down with wood blocks from various countries, in order to give them a trial. The blocks of Australian ironbark were vastly superior to all others, and were almost as sound as on the day .when they were laid. There is a tremendous demand abroad for our timbers, and if we w ill use the products of other couutries, they w ill bave an opportunity to use ours. The whole scheme of nature is being overturned by the principles laid down by this Committee. I s it not the most natural thing in the world for Canadian softwoods to be used in Australia where they are most suitable for our purposes, and for our hardwoods to be used in .Canada wliere they would be more useful than their own? between Canada and Australia? and throughout this debate I have been advocating increased preference within the Empire. In respect of timber we have an opportunity of giving effect to that principle. But is the Minister doing anything in that way? No t at all. All he does is to propose prohibitive duties on material that should be coming into the country in order to enable us to build more homes for our people. The greatest demand in Australia to-day is for more homes for the workers, more homes for the soldiers, and better-class We bad not the vesdwellings for those who can afford them. Althoughi t has"" been stated that the War Service Homes Commission has purchased a great deal of the timber it requires for future construction, the mere fact of imposing these duties will increase the cost of construction, and Aus-honourable member for Wide tralians will continue to go homeless because this Committee will not see that the proper thing to do is to make a reciprocal arrangement between the Commonwealth and other countries within the Empire which produce t i m bers that could be used for certain purposes to greater advantage than our own. If the imported and the local timbers are worked together in their Surely the honourable proper relationship to each other, there w ill be no need for anybody to be out of employment in the timber trade; we shall save the people hundreds of thousands of pounds; we shall enable the people who need homes-and they are many-to build them, and at the same time we shall be conserving one of our greatest natural assets. It is useless to talk about what should be done in the way of afforestation.

187,Mr Fleming,"The r e should be,allowance for the conditions that actually exist. If we had re-afforestation in f u l l operation, there would be some rea. son for advocating the imposition of duties on imported timbers; but we must always import some timbers. When honourable members say that we can grow aU the timber we require, they show than they do not know much about Australia. It that thegiant redwoods of . California w ill parts of the world where -the climate is cool and damp, with fogs in winter time. They cannot be grown in dry country or on parched land. Have honourable members who say that we can grow the timber that at present we import ever put their theory to a practical test? I have had practical experience in trying to grow some of these timbers. The forestry experts in New South Wales visited my property to see what timbers could be best grown' there, and I took their advice. Nearly every expert will say that it is useless trying to grow the foreign timbers that are of any great value, be. cause they will not thrive in our climate. The best thing that a man can do is. to ring-bark the inferior native trees, leave the good sticks that are growing, and allow the young timbers to come up naturally. Both the practical man and the man who has studied the theoretical side of re-afforestation say that the proper way to re-afforest Australia is to leave the process to nature i h that way and allow the young trees to come up in exceptional portions of Australia can softwoods be grown. This is naturally a country, for the production of hardwoods. There are places, like the Atherton Tablelands, the Upper Murray, and a few othei localities where softwoods can be grown; on the Upper Murray particularly, redwoods might do well. But, generally speaking, Australia is not strong in timber-producing capacity, and we must look to the future. The Commonwealth is no pocket handkerchief place; it comprises nearly 3,000,000 square miles of country which should be carrying 20,000,000 or 30,000,000 people within It w ill be necessary for us to grow timber at a much greater rate than we have thought of so far. The only way in which we can ..furnish the requirements of the [380]2 9413 future is by. taking care of our own forests, and by growing the foreign timbers we require in places where they can be grown to advantage-and those places are very few at the same time using as much of them as we can while not allowing them to displace our own. We ought not to permit foreign timbers to come in at a rate that is well known, for instance, will cause our own timbers to become less valuable or allow trees already ripe to grow onfy in certain remain uncut and go to decay. Our policy should be to make use of foreign timbers for the conservation of our own better woods; but, if we accept the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews), we shall be doing a real and lasting in j u r y, not only to the building community and all those citizens who require houses, but also to our own timber industry itself. not admit that in j u r y w ill be done to the timber industry by accepting the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews). Thei m position of an increased duty w ill not have the slightest effect upon the costof an ordinary weatherboard house a l ready in course of erection. I pointed out last week that where large principals are used in the bigger type of buildings, oregon can be used w i th advantage in respect to length; but, as a matter of fact, it is not necessary to use imported tim bers in any part of an ordinary house. Can we get a better class of flooring than of their own accord. Only jarrah or any other Australian hardwood? In many of the better class of houses now being built, the floors are of Australian hardwood, which > when polished, requires no covering other than a few rugs. In 1914, the local price of oregon was 17s. per 100 superficial feet; in 1917, it had increased to 40s.; in 1920, the price was 70s.; and in the early part of this year it was 65s. What proportion does the duty of Is. per 100 superficial feet bear to the 48s. increase in the price since 1914? In the same way, the price of redwood has risen from 30s. to 125s. Bight along the line the prices of a. very few years. all imported timbers have increased out of all bounds. Those who are in the building trade know that the higher cost of construction during recent years was .due to the increased cost of labour and",40,Lamond Th E Basis Of Said That Because Of The High Price Of
188,Mr Fbancis (Henty) [ 5 . 3 7 ],"I domaterial, just as the more recent decrease can be ascribed to the financial troubles caused by the war. But the duties we ask for are to apply to the future, and' not to the past. The Australian hardwoods may have had a fair margin of^the market prices during the war, when it was impossible to get timbers from overseas, and when it was necessary for Australians to come to the front and provide the timber yards with the surplus they required and which they had maintained, in pre-war times, by importations from abroad. One advantage derived' from the lack of shipping during' the war was the attention our timber merchants began to devote to the natural seasoning of hardwood. borne in mind .in connection with this question is the fact that the vessels that bring us timbers from Sweden, Norway, and other places are manned by foreign crews, and subsidized by foreign countries, whose trade with Australia, so far as purchases from us are concerned, amounts to very few thousands of pounds per annum, whereas we pay them millions of pounds per annum for timber. I do not uphold the interests of any combination of timber merchants which will seek to increase the price of timber out of sight, but I recognise that our timber merchants have their difficulties and suffer losses. Sometimes, in order to capture a certain line of trade for themselves, they are obliged to enter into competition with other industries, and sell at a price tliat is below the cost of production. I have heard the wild statement made that these merchants are making huge profits. So they did during the war, but within the last few months, possibly because of this approaching debate, their prices have heen reduced considerably, and we hope that the new legislation to be introduced will make it impossible for them to take advantage of -any increase in the duty and pass it on. .If the Minister will not agree to in-crease this duty, I must support the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. tived.

In Queensland there are millions of feet which, unless used for the making of boxes, will be more or less wasted. is speaking of off-cuts. the tops of the pines -This, for all essential purposes, is first-class pine; but it cannot be cut into the lengths required for building purposes. however,. between the branches to secure timber up to 6 feet in length, and from such lengths a great proportion of the timber required for the making of boxes is secured. Unless this trade can be reserved for our timber mills, the effects will be serious. This by-product, as it were, very often represents the difference between failure and success. In the case of the other parts of the trees, the millers have to meet with all sorts of competition in the open market, and it is by means of these off-cuts and tops used for box-making that they are able to show a profit at the end of the month. duties proposed will afford no protection at all. One has only to go down to the wharfs to see the enormous proportions that this boxmaking business has attained.

I shall not use the word ""ratio,"" to which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) seems to have an objection. It seems to me that the cost of reducing the timber in both cases must be the same. for Trade and Customs) [5.56] -The reason for not asking for higher duties is that this item deals with case timber, which is mostly produced from off-cuts. In Queensland, not merely the off-cuts, but the tops and portion of the trunk are used, and they are worked at a very much . lower cost than is the heavier timber. I take it that timber undressed for boxes, and timber dressed or partly dressed for the same purpose, stand together, and It is possible, there is Is. per 100 feet allowed as between the timber undressed and not cut to size, and the timber that is cut to size and dressed or partly dressed. This difference of Is. is regarded as sufficient. I was looking for a considerable advance in the duties on the two sub-items i and J, for the box-making industry is vitally concerned.. Surely we do not wish to see the tops of our pine trees used simply for firewood?. Timber is coming in from America and other places in great quantities, already cut; and unless The substantial protection is afforded to the mill-owners and box-makers there is no possibility of their competing. Some petrol and kerosene companies bring their oil into Australia in bulk, and use the local light timbers for their cases. In this way, a considerable trade has been Though fruit cases are established; but if the duties are left as they appear on the schedule, I should say that the companies will, in future, bring also their timber in bulk. To my mind, we ought to protect the off-cuts along with the otherparts of the trees, for, otherwise, we shall be faced with conThis is an insiderable unemployment. Thousands of butter-boxes are made from these tops. Only a little while ago, since this Tariff came into operation, a deputation of box-makers waited on me to point out that, in face of the competition from America, they would be compelled to close down unless the duties were increased.",42,Lamond Th E Basis Of Said That Because Of The High Price Of

Perhaps the honourable gentleman is not aware that the price of timber has gone down very considerably, not only in Vancouver, but also on the lower mainland. In this connection, I should like to read the following extract from the Timberman of March, 1921:With tlie coming of spring,'mills and logging in this Parliament upon that question camps are resuming operations, and, while was very close, there being a majority of they may not be operating to capacity, greater only two. activity prevails.

Both on Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland mills have started again, each fixing its wages without a uniform wage being agreed upon. To treat these tops for box-making is more costly by at least 3d. per 100 feet than it is to treat the ordinary pine log. The cost of transporting that timber by Many rail is the same as for the best lines. It would cost at least 3d. per 100 feet more to cut this box timber than in the case of ordinary lines cut up, into planks. 3d. more? Men who understand the position thoroughly, and who have worked out every item, and factor, have come to the conclu[6.1] I sion that the coslT is at least 3d. more upon this class of timber.

Dr.' MALONEY (Melbourne) [6.7] Reference has been made to the fact that the British-Imperial Oil Company sends its oil here in bulk, whereas the Standard Oil Company exports its commodity to Australia in cases and tins. The fact recalls to my mind that when a representative of the latter firm visited Australia some years ago he was preceded by a-report from South Africa to the effect that he had said, while in that countiy, that he could buy up the Australian Parliament, if necessary. I challenged that gentleman, within these precincts, and told him that, while the Standard Oil Company might be very rich and powerful, it was not powerful enough, nor had it the .means, to buy up the Australian people, possessed, as they were, of the adult franchise.

234,Mr Bayley,"Shal l I be in orderattention of the Committee to what I consider is a serious omission from the item. I should like the Minister to have brought forward a new sub-item M dealing, not with three-ply as at present, but with furniture timbers. The well-being of the north of Queensland cannot be safeguarded unless we grant adequate protection in respect of the splendid furniture and cabinet-making timbers which grow there in abundance. Such timbers, with but few exceptions, do not enter into competition with other commercial or marketable woods. They are in a class by themselves. It is uot necessary for me to enumerate them, since they are well known to the Committee; but, in order that they may be given adequate protection, I suggest that the Minister should deal with them in a special item, providing for a duty of 17s. 6d. per 100 super, feet under the British Tariff, and a duty of 20s. per 100 super, feet under the intermediate and general Tariffs. urge the Minister( Mr Greene) to give serious consideration to the suggestion just made by the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Bayley), that a special subitem dealing with furniture timbers be inserted. largely from the islands of the Pacific that are not administered by the Commonwealth, and where black labour is employed. There also grow in the Pacific Islands in respect of which we have a mandate, timbers that are the equal of those imported from the other islands, and which seriously compete with timbers grown on the Continent. Not only in northern Queensland, but in Tasmania, we have such timbers as blackwood and oak, which are extensively used in the manufacture of furniture; and I think it is necessary to have a special sub-item dealing with all furniture timbers. for Trade and .Customs) [6.26] I have thought over the question of introducing a sub-item relating to furniture timbers, but I see no necessity for a higher duty on such timbers than there is in respect of other timber. Furniture timbers are, from their very nature, of greater value than the ordinary class of building timber, and I know of no greater protection I desire to call the that the furniture timbers produced in this countiy could possibly have than ' their excellence for high-class furniture. I do not think we could possibly import timbers better than our own for such a purpose. Certain timbers are imported for the making of lower-class furniture, and they do, to a certain extent, come into competition with our own furniture timbers. example, are imported. cedar and walnut imported for furniture making is very small. Most of the cedar -we import comes, I think, from the islands of the Pacific, and is of a very much lower quality than our own; so that it could not be a direct competitor with it. manufacture of low-class furniture. The fittings of this chamber, for instance, are of cedar, brought ""either from Queensland or northern New South"" Wales, and the cedar that comes from the Pacific Islands is by no. means as good. It is a red cedar of a kind, but Such, timbers come in very in no way approaches the excellence of our own product. The same remark will ?PPly to our maple. Queensland maple is of a much higher class than any maple we can import. Nor is there any timber of the same class that can compare with our blackwood and silky oak. We have also the white cedars, and many of our scrub timbers, which are among the finest that can be obtained for furnituremaking purposes. There are some Victorian timbers from which magnificent furniture can be made. I do not think anything is to be gained for Australian furniture timbers by imposing a special duty as suggested. My impression is that a good-class furniture timber will always bring its full price in the Australian market. For that reason I do not think we should assist the saw-mill industry, as an industry engaged in producing furniture timber, by imposing a special duty. Most of the furniture timber which comes in is of oak, some of it being Japanese oak. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8.0 p.m.",45,Mills Ano Camps Be Opentng

The otlier subitems which we have considered related to timber either in the rough or sawn. Plywood, or. veneer, is distinctly a manufactured article, and as such gives a great deal of employment in a number of the States. It s manufacture is a new industry in Australia, and tliat accounts for the meagre protection granted to it heretofore. Queensland suitable for plywood ? lian timber could be used for plywood. In the 1908 Tariff the protection was 7s. 6d. per 100 super, feet, a mere bagatelle, having regard to the fact that plywood is only £ or 3-16ths of an inch in thickness. OfJ inch thickness eight sheets of threeply would be required to make an inch, consequently the effective duty under the 1914 Tariff was about Is. per 100 super, feet. to 4s. British, 4s. intermediate, and 5s. general; but I ask the Committee to put this important phase of manufacture on a firmer footing. If any proof be needed that the protection given is f a r from effec.tive, the statistics of importations supply it. The returns furnished by the Collector of Customs show that the imports into the State of New South Wales during the six months ended 31st March, 1921, of three-ply, veneer, and veneers n.e.i., tabled according to the countries of origin, were as 1,628 super, feet; Canada, 451,778 super, feet; New Zealand, 3,738 super, feet; Finland, 2,063 super, feet; Japan, 246,712 super, feet; Sweden, 121,951 super, feet; or a total of 827,870 super, feet for only half a year. In Victoria the imports for the corresponding period were „ 799,000 super, feet; in South Australia, 224,000 super, feet; and in Western Australia, 99,000 super, feet. furnish conclusive proof that the present Tariff is not sufficent for this important industry, and no one can claim that Australia has not the timbers requisite for the carrying out of this work. scarcely a timber grown in this country that cannot be used for the manufacture of three-ply. The factories in Victoria use blackwood, Tasmanian myrtle, and the hardwoods grown in the southern parts of the Continent. Queensland has a very wide range of timbers; almost everyone of them is used i i the manufacture of plywoods. This article is a direct competitor with timber, and is enabled to compete successfully, despite the fact that the amount paid out in wages is very great, because it is economical in its use of tim ber Three-ply is manufactured from a veneer 1-16 inch in thickness, and it will be readily seen that a good log will yield nearly five times as much timber for ply as for sawn timber. That is a virtue of the plywood, because it is most desirable that we should economize! in the use of Australian"" timbers. When other items E v e n South Austrahave been under discussion many honourable members, notably the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster), have emphasized the statement that there is an insufficiency of timber in Australia, and that, therefore, we should allow foreign timbers to be imported without hindrance. The plywood industry is actively conserving our timbers, and is directly giving employment; to thousands This Tariff increases the duty of men throughout the States. As to its uses, many houses are lined and ceiled with it , and it makes an effective and beautiful interior finish. Nearly all the furniture manufactured to-day is backed with plywood because of its lightness, and the ease w it h which it can be handled. The industry draws upon other than the timber industry for its raw material. A t the present time the dairy-' ing industry in Victoria is feeling the effect of the closing down of the majority of. the ply factories. Casein is used exfollows:-TJnited Kingdom, tensively for the manufacture of the glue with which the various plies are held together. Casein is made from skim milk, and it is worth to the dairying industry in Victoria £50,000 per annum. I ask honourable members to remember when voting on this item that they are not only dealing with one phase of the timber industry, but that by strengthening the Those figures plywood industry they will be doing much to Stabilize dairying by finding an outlet for what, in other* circumstances, will be, if not wasted, at any rate used for mere pig feed.

It may be true, as the honourable gentleman says, that the importations under it are small, but I would point out as bearing on the sub-item relating to ""felloes, made of hickory, in the rough,"" that we have agreed that hickory shall come in at a duty of only 5 per cent., and that; in view of that fact, we should see that whatever hickory felloes or spokes are required in Australia are made here by our own workmen. Locally made felloes are the equal of any that can be obtained from abroad, and seeing that certain timber duties which appeared in the schedule as introduced have been increased, I think it reasonable that an increase should be granted in respect of this item. I was' under the impression when we were discussing certain duties on timber last week, that the view of the Minister was that any increase granted, in respect of one item would regulate the duty fixed in respect of what I may speak of as subsidiary items in the same division. The Minister would do well to increase the duty. One mill in my district manufactures a large number of these felloes, and the proprietors tell me that it is necessary for them to have a very substantial increase in the duty. cent. fact that this work is performed in the Commonwealth from imported hickory, we should give protection to the industry,' and see that foreigners are not able to undersell the local manufacturer. I contend that, in view of the earlier decision of the Committee on other items in this division, there should be an increase in the duties on all these sub-items. One of the seven deadly sins is said to have been gluttony, and I am afraid that some of the demands that are being made are becoming a littl e "" over the m a r k ,"" and that evil may result.

It appears as if the importations are fall ing away. during the debate that the Minister has made a comparison with the war period. It is due to the lack of We are not yet back to normal. duty collected amounted to £ 4 , 3 6 1 . The fact that last year the amount was only £631 seems to indicate that the Australian manufacturer is taking care of practically all the trade. In those circumstances it does not appear that an increase of the duty would be justified. if the duty on imports last year represented only a few pounds, we have to amongst manufacturers which consider not so much what has happened in the past as what may happen in the future. During the next twelve months I Australian industry may encounter severe competition in respect of hubs. These are manufactured articles earning from foreign countries to compete with the product of local industry, and, in the circumstances, a duty of 15 per cent, is no protection at all. If the Minister( Mr. Greene) would increase the duty to even 20 per cent, it would be some encouragement to the local manufacturers to make further additions to their factories. I w o u l d are not the prefer to see the rates increased to about 40 per cent., because that would be a ""means, of excluding importations. If such a duty would not affect the Customs returns,* the Minister should be prepared to grant the rate suggested by those who are engaged in the industry.

It is not a question of the quantities imable member asking for Protection when ported in abnormal times, and although the Minister stated that the revenue from the duty imposed in 1913 was, approximately, £5,000, he must remember that the circumstances are now altogether different. I have already mentioned on several occasions that the cost of production in other parts of the world has been reduced owing to a reduction in wages, and that it will be quite possible for hubs manufactured in America to enter the Commonwealth and compete with those made here. firms have installed expensive plants, and I cannot understand why the Minister is not prepared to agree to an increased duty on this sub-item when he has increased others. If he wished to be consistent, he should not have made any increase on those items which we have already passed. already agreed to apply with equal force to others; I have allowed some items to pass in an endeavour to assist the Minister, but he now appears to be objecting to what is only reasonable. justification for an increase, I would not hesitate in granting it. justification, because I have been assured by those in the industry that there is a prospect of the business going into the hands of the American manufacturers. first sign of danger, the Tariff Board can investigate. too much for granted, because we do not know what powers the proposed Board will have. be employed making hubs?

I have here a statement in regard to the articles covered by sub-items B to H. It readslie sub-items (B) and (c), ""hubs,"" and subitems ( F ) , (G), and ( H ) , ""spokes."" Prior to 19IS the great majority of small spokes and small hubs was imported from the TJnited States of America. When the United States of America entered the war the American prices Many for vehicle woodware rose to enormous heights, and when stocks began to get low the Australian merchants were forced to turn to the Australian manufacturers for supplies. Such a sudden demand could not readily be coped with, especially as the hardwood saw-millers were already taxed to their utmost to supply the building trade. Further, timber cannot be seasoned in a few days, and the demand was so great that the merchants requested the The increased dxities manufacturers to send in thc goods as fast as they could be turned. It says a good deal for spotted gum and bluegum that it gave general satisfaction under such disadvantageous circumstances. The position now is that considerable additions to their plants have been made by the Australian manufacturers at high cost, and there is now sufficient machinery in Australia to cater for the whole of the requirements of the Commonwealth in these lines, and a fair amount of export trade as well. Since the beginning of 1921, the United States of America's principal manufacturers have reduced their prices 20 per cent. With freights falling and the exchange position steadily improving between the United States of America and Great Britain, the difference between the Australian and the United States of America manufacturers' prices has been greatly reduced.

As the Minister( Mr Greene) is not prepared to meet' honourable members in a reasonable spirit, 1 ask the Committee to decide that the increase I propose is a reasonable one. . -There are forces gathering which are ready to spring, upon the Australian market to an extent that will place the Committee in a most peculiar position when it is fouud that, under this so-called high protective Tariff, many of our industries are going to the wall. We have certainly passed through abnormal times, but things are going to pieces in other parts of the world, and we shall find that, even despite our anti-dumping legislation, there will be heavy importations into Australia. Even the Argus, the mouthpiece of the Free Trade party, stands aghast at the import figures for the last ten months, showing that we have, in that period, imported £150,000,000 worth of goods; twice the value of our imports in any previous twelve months. Making a figures show how our market is being flooded under the existing Tariff, and I am afraid that the next twelve, months will tell a worse tale, because accompanying this great influx of importations will be the collapse of Australian industries. Of course, some honourable members do not care a snap of the fingers, so long as they can get cheap goods from Japan, or elsewhere, produced under black labour conditions. Free Traders, and, indeed, some members of the Country party, would throw up their hats with joy if ' they saw our streets lined with .unemployed, and our factories closing down. The future is laden with great menace to the trade of this country. The more people we can get to help us to pay our debts, the better it will be,' but some honourable members apparently want to see our"" population decrease, and our people out of employment. big debate on a small item' like this!

The honourable memGreene) consent to an extra 5 per ber for Hunter( Mr Charlton) is only asking for 5 per cent, increase on hubs. Even the Corner party ought to be prepared to grant this. Over, twenty years ago, I remember, that a man who was having a vehicle built, was asked by the wheelwright what shafts he would like to have. The .purchaser asked the wheelwright what he would recommend, and fche wheelwright said that, although there was much talk about hickory, he, with his experience, would suggest blue gum. This suggestion was accepted, and the vehicle was so built. There is too much talk of American hickory, in view of the fact that we have just asgood timber, and just as good workmen, in Australia. Honourable members opposite by their vote to-day, have closed up a few industries ; but we notice that when the honourable member for Indi( Mr Robert Cook) asks for increased duties, his request is readily assented to.

There is no need to import timber for the manufacture of hubs. Better timber than our own for that purpose cannot be obtained anywhere.

A similar remark is applicable to rims, made of hickory, bent, squared, plain, and in the rough. There is no need to import any of this timber. We have ample supplies of suitable timber for this purpose in Australia.

A l though there are quite a number of people engaged in the manufacture of lressed spokes in Australia, we have had only oue application for an increased duty.

All spokes for heavy vehicles are made in Australia. agree to increase the rate on spokes in the general Tariff, sub-item o, by 5 per cent. ? That will not cost the Minister or the Government ' anything, but it will show the people concerned that we are. trying to do something for them. If the article is not imported to a great extent, the extra duty will not make much difference from a revenue point of view, but we may close the door against future importations, because we have plenty of timber in Australia to make spokes from. In view of the labour problem, we should endeavour to make as many articles as possible in our own country. By granting an increase we should show the manufacturers in Australia that we have some concern for them. They have stocks of local timbers, and they should be encouraged to nse them. would you use to make light spokes? . many timbers that we could use. The honourable member knows some in his own district. one. that no spokes are imported. want a duty on them* future. I hope the Minister has not made ap his mind to do no more under this item, or that, as the industry is only a small and struggling one, it is not worthy of much consideration. These people are not in my electorate, so that it does not affect me whether they get an increased duty or not, but it does affect the Commonwealth from an industrial point of view. no importations of spokes. Minister to say that they were not imported to any great extent. We have in Australia timber quite fit to make, not only the spokes, but the whole wheel. It is not fair to throw cold water on an industry because it is in a struggling condition. We were very glad during the war to take advantage of the efforts of this and many other industries, and now that we are returning to normal times it is surely fair for the Government to protect it against foreign trade at any rate, especially against the competition of countries where the industrial conditions are not as favorable as they are here. Surely we are not going to ask the Australian manufacturers to scrap their machinery and throw their hands out of employment? A duty of 15 per cent, is not worth anything to protect an industry which is striving touse all Australian grown timbei. to use it. all the better. We were forced to do quite a number of things during the war. We flew the flag w,hich was inscribed "" Australia First! Advance Australia!"" and we should fly it still. If people stood to us during the war, we should secure them against the foreigner to-day. They are asking only for a tinpot advance, in the duty; but the Minister says to' them, "" You can take 15 per cent, or leave it alone."" They might as well leave it alone, if that is all the protection they so. business for the fun of it. The same is true about members of Parliament.

These are important parts of a vehicle, and must be able to stand great strain; they are made out of Australian timber. Yet upon hickory manufactured into spokes before it leaves foreign countriesthe Minister will not agree to a higher duty : than 15 per cent. there are large importations of spokes, why does he not agree to a duty of 35 per cent -? His attitude means that the firms who stood by us in time of war are to be In the main, this Tariff will mean the industrial salvation' of Australia, because of the encouragement given to';mariy Australian industries.

I cannot understand, wny the Minister will not grant an increase of 5 per cent, in the duties when an industry is threatened with foreign competition. We do not wish to interfere with the British or in competition from foreign termediate rates, but we do ask for an increase in' the general Tariff. It was wrong to encourage these people to start these industries during the war without I have no personal interest to telling them that as soon as the war was over they would be at the mercy of foreigners. Some of this timber comes from countries that were not our Alliesi n the war. We import timber from some countries that w^sre If , even :on the next not even friendly towards us.

It is all very well to enter this House with, a Free Trade mind and advocate Free Trade sentiments. I am an Australian, and I stand for Austrar lian-made goods. I plead for an Australian industry, and the Minister should be prepared to grant the 5 per cent, increase.
