24,Mr Groom (Darling Downs) [10.41].,"tlie members of the Opposition are representatives of the people, just as are Ministerial supporters. When information is asked for, it is supplied, not for the advantage of any particular party, but for the advantage of Parliament ancl of the people it represents. It is entirely a new theory that those responsible for the administration of public affairs are not uncler the obligation to supply information regarding public matters to members of the Opposition. Following the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General made a reply to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition which contained much that was clever, but, instead of giving the information asked for, he, in effect, supplied us with a copy of Comic Cuts. He attempted to discredit the work done by Select Committees, altogether overlooking the fact that a former Government in which he was a Minister, when faced with a request for legislation respecting shipping, appointed a Commission, consisting of members of Parliament, of which he was chairman. That Commission having made f u l l and complete inquiries in Australia, he went to Great Britain to make himself still further acquainted with the subject, and the Navigation Bill, which is the result, having passed through the Senate, is now on our business paper. The method then adopted was the right one. When a Government has to give effect to a policy, it must obtain the fullest knowledge and the best expert opinion to guide it along safe paths. Again, when we came to deal witb the question of fire and life assurance we determined to appoint a Royal Commission, and that Commission furnished us with complete information on the subject. And so with the sugar industry. Great as are the ramifications of the sugar industry, and the complex questions associated with it, they are no greater than are those of banking, and we have a Royal Commission collecting evidence to guide us in determining how that industry is to be treated. If this is going to be a practical working Legislature for Australia we shall have to develop more and more the Committee side of this great House. many advantages. members representing all parties to meet round a common table for the consideration of common problems. It enables them to realize more full y the difficulties surrounda different attitude will be taken up. ing those problems, and in that way agreements are arrived at which often reduce the issues before Parliament. [""3]2 we use the Committee functions of this House to obtain from outside information relating to great commercial questions such as banking, navigation, bankruptcy law, and company law, the more will Parliament be assisted in its legislation. Unless we avail ourselves of such assistance the House will break down hopelessly in an effort to solve everything in open debate. 1 Great Britain has its magnificent Board of Trade, which is able to supply Parliament with whatever information it requires concerning matters of this kind. We have already 'established a Statistical Department which gives us much valuable information, but df the proposal of the late Government for the appointment of a Board of Trade had been adopted we' should have had at our disposal to-day all the information that we require in this connection. It is not just to the Parliament or to the people that we should be asked to deal with this important financial matter without a scrap of evidence to guide us. The only information supplied to us by the Government consists of certain tables which may practically be found in the CommonweaUh Year-Book. There should be an investigation of the financial crises of Australia, and the defects of our banking laws in dealing with those crises. Such an investigation would materially assist us in developing the policy of this bank. But we have no such in-, fonhation for our guidance. We are asked to legislate upon a most important question with nothing more before us than a piece' of paper submitted to us in the form of a B ill . This problem ought not to be decided on purely party issues. It ought never to have been submitted as a party matter. It should be held to be superior to party considerations. The far better course to have pursued would have been to have an investigation by men representing each side to determine the best scheme for a National Bank of Australia. The Ministry, however, say in effect: "" It was decided for ' us by a Conference, over twenty years ago, that we should have a State Bank. We do not know what induced the ConSuch a system has ference to come to"" that decision, but if It enables honourable determined that we should have a State1 Bank, and you are going to have one, and to have one in the form that we propose.""

We have been informed by the Prime Minister, in effect, that it is going to be a State Bank carrying on business exactly on the lines adopted by other banks in Australia. It will have to go to the Government for its notes, and obtain them on exactly the same terms as do other banks. give the bonorable member any concern. point later on. quiry. portant suggestions have' been put before the House. second place that if we are to have an Australian bank, it should be a National central bank, and that we should consider whether it ought to be owned by the Government, or privately-owned, or whether there should be a combination of Both State and private ownership. point raised is whether the note issue should be associated with the Bank. Surely these are subjects for inquiry, and the whole field of the banking laws of Australia also affords scope for investigation. we are to have a State Bank. The New Zealand Government appointed a Select Committee to inquire into this question, and that Committee took much evidence, including the testimony of experts from the Associated Banks of the Dominion. It presented its report on the 24th November, 1910, and in that report we have the following definition of a State Bank:A State Bank may be defined as a bank of issue and deposit carrying on similar business to that undertaken by the present Associated Banks, but owned entirely* by the State. The Bill that we have before us cannot be described as one to provide for the establishment of a State Bank of deposit, carrying on business similar to that undertaken by the Associated Banks, and owned entirely by the State. mittee reported furtherIt does not appear that there is at the present time any bank in the world that corresponds to this definition, though it was stated in evidence that the Banks of Venice and Hamburg were once State Banks of this description. The report shows that none of the witnesses advocated the establishment of a The proseparate and new State iBank. That is a remarkable fact. The Committee was appointed to consider the advantage or otherwise of a State Bank of issue and deposit, and a State currency paper, and it reported1. As regards a State Bank(a) That the establishment of an entirely new State Bank of Issue and Deposit is inadvisable; (i) That a permanent and effective partnership between the State and the private shareholders of \the Bank of New Zealand, or the acquirement of the present shareholders' interests on equitable terms by the State, is desirable. It is a subject for inI have referred to this report to show that During this debate several imNew Zealand, when it found itself confronted with the problem that we have It has been urged in the now before us, proceeded to deal with it in a business-like manner. An investigation was made of the banking conditions of the country, and the crises through which the Domfinion had passed to ascertain whether any useful lesson might be adduced from them. But we are asked to A third legislate in the dark without a scrap of evidence from the commercial or banking community, or from the producing interests which, in connection with the export of their produce, are very much concerned in banking. The Democratic methods of We are told in the first place that New Zealand are constantly being referred to as a model for us to follow, and we find the Dominion in this matter seeking to act, not in the dark, but in the fullest light of day. When we ask what has prompted the Government to propose the establishment of this bank, we are told in the first place that it is going to give greater financial stability. The honourable member for New England. last night drew some horrifying picjtures of banking in Australia. Having painted the worse picture possible, he declared that he would refrain from saying more, because tie did not wish to discredit any one. He asserted that if he said any more with regard to banking matters the stench from them would be so dreadful as to sicken Australia. The Prime Minister, The Select Comhowever, has said that we owe a debt of gratitude to the banksIt is of no use denying, and this party do not wish to deny, that banks have played an important part in the development of Australia, and we want to give them f u l l credit for all they have done.

Such an investment would possibly be regarded as a first charge on the bank; and where, under "" the circumstances, is the co-operative principle? This shows clearly hdw essential it is to have an inquiry. At any rate, the remarks of the honourable member for New England indicated that he did not understand the problem. Of course, it is said that this proposed bank will always have the .Government behind it ; but the Government could give assistance to a private bank in the same way. The plea of the honourable inember was that in times of necessity it is a good thing to secure stability by giving the Government credit to some one; and the idea is that that some one should be a State Bank. We are told that the proposed bank will have a great influence .in lowering the rates of interest. It is rather interesting in this connection to remember the words of the honourable member for New England when he spoke on the Address-in-ReplyI heartily congratulate the Government on proposing to strike the first blow at high rents ( by coining down with a national banking proposal. The first blow will be struck at high rents when we find cheap money for the people who wish to have their own homes, and to pay no rent.

However, I may say that theview of the honourable member for New England is that this bank is going to be one of the first great departures necessary to secure to those who produce the wealththeir proportion of that wealth. Does that not bear out what was said last night by the honourable member for Parramatta, namely, that one of the ideas of those who outsidewere supporting the scheme is the distribution of wealth throughout the community, and that the bank is regarded as the one step to that end. Of course, when we have the proposal before us now in a sober way, we do not hear the Prime Minister making, use' of such words. Those great aims have all been swept aside, and we are told that this bank is to carry on business in the same way as any other bank. The right honourable gentleman has very properly put those other views aside, as, indeed, he is bound to clo when placing what he considers a business proposal before us.

Is history repeating itself? I confess that this proposed bank will start with a great initial advantage.

Swiss' banking laws the Cantons are given a direct pecuniary interest in the National Bank. reserved for Information on such a point as this might well have been supplied by the Government. The question put by the honourable member for Richmond this morning was a very pertinent one. When the honourable member turns to the United States he finds that .the people of that country had all the information to be obtained from standard text-books, just as the Prime Minister had, but they felt that a higher obligation rested upon them, and so they made inquiries from nearly every country in the world, not through the medium of some partisan who might write a text-book in favour of or against a particular policy, but first hand. They made a complete scientific inquiry into the banking systems of the world, and that information is to be obtained here in our own Library, but the If so, obtaining of it did not absolve the American people from the necessity of making f u l l inquiry into their own conditions as well.

41,Mr Groom,"But has the policy beenafraid we shall not be able to get much assistance from him in the solution of that problem. I mention these facts to show how ill-prepared and ill-equipped we are for the task we are asked to undertake. Other nations have not the same contempt for history as have the honourable member for Indi and some others. They realize that after all history does recount the experience of nations, and that something is to be gained by seeing how others have suffered. History naturally does not repeat itself in every detail, because the conditions of each country are peculiar to itself, and in any examination of the history of other countries the experience gained must be applied to our conditions. The idea that we should have a central banking systerm on the European plan has been put forward. Some term it the bank of banks, others the National banking system. A leading authority, Conant, says, regarding the evolution of central bankingOne of the strongest arguments in favour of a central bank is the fact that practically every country but the United States has arrived by a process of evolution at the central banking system. There is not to-day an independent nation in Europe which has not a central bank controlling the note-issuing nnd exchange situation, most of them established within sixty years, and several of them within ten years. If "" history is philosophy leading by example,"" then the history of banking teaches that financial progress depends in large measure on the existence of a central monetary institution, dowered by law, with the power to use its credit without any limits, except those imposed by sound banking policy, for the protection of the national gold stock and national financial security. The reason for the evolution of the central bank is the reason for the evolution of other forms of concentration in modern society. It applies to finance the system of larger units and greater economy which has applied long since in the world of government, railway systems, and manufacturing. That has been the experience of Europe, and is constantly pointed to as being the proper evolution of banking. When we examine the evolution of that system in every country concerned, we see that it Was not brought about simply by coming to Parliament and getting it to pass a Bill. sideration by all the banking authorities in full consultation with the authorities of Government, in order to arrive at a practical solution of the whole question. Take Switzerland, the last of all to establish the central banking system. A vigorous dis3tr. Groom. cussion first took place there. The matter, I think, was the subject at one time of a referendum, there were conflicting parties in the Parliament, and the final result is given in these wordsAs to organization, an agreement was ultimately arrived at which provided that the new bank should combine the character of a private banking institution with that of a State Hank. It was a compromise between the pure State Bank theory .and the theory oifi private banks. powerful. sense not to exercise all its powers. In every country which has formed a National bank-Italy, France, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland-the process has been a natural evolution based on the actual experience through which the people have lived. The whole of these National banks have been moulded not by mere theorists, but by men who knew what they were doing, realized the financial needs of their country, and tried to devise an institution that would meet the occasion. Not one of these countries adopted the idea of a purely State bank, and there is no precedent anywhere for such a Bill as this. The question was raised whether the central banking system was good for the United States. In that case, again, the question was the application of the principle to new conditions in a country which is similar in some ways to our own. A leading authority saysThere are eminent bankers who hold that we should establish in the United States a great central bank vested with powers similar to those exercised by foreign central banks. Undoubtedly the central banks in European countries effectively and satisfactorily regulate and control banking conditions in those countries; and if conditions in the United States were similar to conditions in European countries the argument in favour of establishing such a bank in the United States would be conclusive. However, conditions in the United States are so different from those existing in European countries that the central banks of Europe cannot fairly be considered precedents for the creation of a similar bank in the United States. In Europe each country has established its own central bank, but no one country of Europe can be compared with the whole of the UnitedI t was the result of careful conStates. The territorial expanse of the United"" States is as great as that of all the countries of Europe combined.

43,Mr Groom,"It is, but it has theloped rapidly in wealth and in financial independence, and there exists a strong and growing feeling of opposition to the concentration of financial strength in few hands or in any section of the country. I have read that to show that the people of the United States are not altogether .satisfied to follow the lead of other countries, but consider the problem of the application to their own conditions of the laws of other lands. That is .one of the considerations that should influence us. banking system has worked well in other -countries, but we must first inquire into our conditions, and ascertain from those who understand Australian banking whether it is or is not best suited for Australia. worked out satisfactorily in Europe may ibe, it is not the scheme that is before this House. The question of placing the note issue in the hands of the Commonwealth Bank has been raised. I do not think we -could have better evidence of the fact that the Government have not fully considered the whole of this proposition than the admission made by the Prime Minister in reply to an interjection following upon the -speech of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who held that the Commonwealth Bank would be good only if it followed-exactly the lines of the Bank of England. The honourable member advocated that it should, therefore, have the control of the note issue, and then the Prime Minister, ""having already introduced the Bill, interjected, "" I am not averse to that after the bank is established."" This showed that a fundamental proposition likely to affect the whole character of the bank was in the Prime Minister's mind, but only as something which it would be necessary to intro-duce after the bank had been established. Surely, if that step is to be taken, the Prime Minister should have waited and -considered the whole proposition of the institution as a bank of issue and deposit in -one complete scheme. In the first address -of the head of the FeBeral Department of Finance to the stockholders of the Swiss National bank, on 23rd August, 1906, -there appeal passages which are worthy of -consideration in connection with what was said regarding the function of the note 'issue by the honourable member for Angus. ThusThe circulation of bank notes must be governed by the demands of commerce and the exchanges; bank notes are tbe medium of the exchanges and markets. If the markets decrease, the circulation of the mediums of exchange must also be reduced j when they multiply, this circulation must be increased in consequence. The circulation is limited by the demand, and these limits should not be exceeded. The paper circulation must always have the precious metal as a solid and stable basis, and it must expand and contract in the same measure as does the metal circulation. The bank note can only serve as an auxiliary, always attached to the principal medium-the metal. It is laid down in the Constitution that the metallic basis of the Swiss bank note issue should be 40 per cent It is proWe know that the central posed to make our own metallic basis 25 per cent. The same authority says, laterThe establishment of the discount rate follows closely upon the question of paper circulation -that is, upon the privilege of issue with which the bank is invested. It goes without saying Whatever the system that has that the bank must try to provide commerce with a discount rate as stable and as favorable as possible, having its attention always fixed upon the general monetary situation, on the situation of the exchanges, on business activity, on the general tendency of affairs, on all the exterior or interior economic conditions which decide either the .extension or contraction of demand. But it must never forget that the only way to check any possible abuses of paper or credit circulation will be found in the discount rate, and that the increase of the rate of discount is the most efficient means of protecting the metal reserve, of preventing currency from leaving the country, and also of preventing an exaggerated extension of credit and imprudent speculation. In this way the bank will be able to maintain stability of its credit and of that of the country, and to prevent and to ameliorate the crises to which we may be exposed. That is a very important opinion by an expert. When we have to consider the kind of bank to be established, surely the question of whether a central bank controlling the note issue in Australia is not a better proposal than that which has been suggested, is a fair subject for inquiry. I mention these matters not to set up any particular theory of my own, but as supporting the demand for further investigation. A word or two regarding the constitution of the proposed bank. The Attorney General twitted the Leader of the Opposition with being on the horns of a dilemma. He says that the honourable gentleman objected to the bank as a one-man bank and as a political bank, and that it cannot be both. Of course that is so; but the objection of the honourable member for Ballarat to the Bill is that it countenances both views, and he wishes to know what is the real intention of the Government. HP pointed out the unwisdom and impracticability of the one-man proposal, and urged the creation of a proper Board'of Advice. If the honourable member for Denison has studied the constitution of the banks of the world, I hope he has taken to heart the lessons given in regard to the need for proper safeguards. Speaking generally, some of these Continental banks are governed by councils appointed by stockholders, directorates, and, in some instances, local committees; and they have independent audits and independent boards of inspection. Under the B ill , one man will be responsible for everything, and the only audit will be that of the Auditor General. If the control of the bank is to be influenced by politicians, it will, undoubtedly, not be very successful. Prime Ministeisays that he does not desire political influence; but let us look at the Bill itself. Clause 15 gives the Governor and Deputy Governor such powers as are prescribed by the Act and the regulations. General may make regulations prescribing all matters necessary or convenient for giving effect to the Act. Under clause 34, the bank may, with the consent of the Treasurer, invest in certain securities; and, under clause 32, the consent of the Treasurer is necessary to the making of rules for the good government of the bank, the classification of its officers, and any matter necessaiy or convenient to be provided for in carrying on its business. Throughout the B ill , the exercise of polibusiness in post-offices for a great many tical control is provided for. The honourable inember for Ballarat asked whether the autocratic or the political influence is to predominate, and desired to be told the reasons actuating the Ministry in the proposals put before us; but he has not been replied to. I wish to make some observations about the provisions for the establishment of a ings Bank. While the supporters of the Ministrv are pledged to the establishment of a Commonwealth Banfc, they are not pledged to the establishment of a Commonwealth Savings Bank, and on that matter I presume they still have open minds. has the Bill before him. It states our intentions. the honourable member is bound by every detail of the measure? we say. on the other side do not always say what they mean. the courage of his convictions, and puts, up a strong fight for his conclusions. The Prime Minister evidently contemplates taking over the Savings Banks from the States, because he saysThis Government will provide, so far as it possibly can do, for taking over the liabilitiesand responsibilities of the State Savings Banks, if the State Banks so desire. He thinks that tliat will inevitably comeabout in any caseI am not advocating the transfer of depositsfTom the State Savings Banks to the Commonwealth, but I think that in the evolution of The things that will be the inevitable result of the establishment of this institution. Being asked if the Commonwealth w ill continue to do the work for the States which it is now doing, he repliedI shall not commit myself to that. I think, Under clause 64, the Governorit is impossible for two Savings Banks to becarried on in the same post-office without some difficulty arising, but I do not say that the StateSavings Banks conducted in postal buildings will be interfered with immediately. The post-offices provide agencies for the State Savings Banks which, if withdrawn,, will seriously interfere with the businessof those banks. The post-offices are the most convenient places in which to have Savings Banks. Our people have been in the habit of transacting Savings Banks years, and probably will continue to go to the post-offices, whether a Commonwealth Savings Bank or a State Savings Bank is located there. banks throughout Australia ought to be adjacent to the post-offices. Commonwealth Savtralia, there are 1,630 post-offices doing Savings Bank business.

What time, for instance, was given by the late Government, of which the honourable inember for Darling of the Bill relating to the Financial AgreeHonorment?

52,Mr Lairdsmith,"In view of thehow ill-timed was the reference by the honourable member for Darling Downs to. the Bank of New Zealand. Its history is so well known that it should hardly be necessary to repeat it. But having listened to the honourable member quoting from the report of theSelect Committee statements that suited his purpose, while carefully omitting those which did not, I feel that a reference to that history is necessary. The public are well aware that the Government of New Zealand came to the rescue of tlie Bank of New Zealand and saved it . It saved it first of all by taking up 500,000 shares, the public also taking up 500,000, and further by depositing with the bank ,£2,000,000 of Government funds in order to tide it over a trying time. This step proved most effective in building up the credit of the bank. The bank is now paying 12 per cent, to the general shareholders, and only 10 per cent, on the shares held by the Dominion Government. Why the dividends should be so restricted in the case of the Government I have never been able to ascertain. The Dominion Government have practically the management of the Bank of New Zealand, and the right honourable member for Swan, who is a great financial authority, will agree with me that that bank was saved by the intervention of the State. The honourable member for Darling Downs complains that we have not sufficient information on banking to guide us in dealing with this B ill . After the crisis of 1893, however, every State was compelled to make inquiries; and we have only to turn to the reports of those inquiries to find ample evidence on the subject. from the report of more than one Royal Commission on the subject. The Commission appointed by the Victorian Government-and which consisted of the following business men: Messrs. Joseph Winter, J. Hume Cook, WilliamD . Beazley, A. O. Sachse, Thomas Scott, Nathaniel Levi, and Thomas Kennedy-reported , after the most careful inquiryUpon the evidence, and from other informaplay into the hands of the private banks. tion in the possession of your Commissioners, The cry of the Opposition in regard to a it is made apparent that it would be desirable raid on the Savings Banks has been raised in the interests of the country that a State to try to frighten the people. Bank should be established in Victoria. In that report alone, honourable will find ample information to guide them Banks of Australia; they would not mind in dealing with this measure. Then, .igain, if they induced the people to withdraw we have only to look at the work done by their money from the Savings Banks and to* the late Sir George Dibbs in coming 10 the bury it.' The Commonwealth Bank, howrescue of the banks in New South Wales. ever, will be able to give both depositors Mr Laird Smith. I cannot understand why the honourable member should complain that we have no information to guide us, and that we ;>re working in the dark. I am inclined to. think, however, that the Age, in a loading, article this morning, puts in a nutshell the whole position of the Opposition; and I hope that that article will be read tnrougiiout the length and breadth of AustraliaI t points out that the Opposition, if it desired to deal effectively with this measure,, should have risen to a higher plane, and not have descended to the abuse to which, we have been submitted. We have heard a lot of twaddle about this Bill constituting; a "" raid "" on the Savings Banks of the States. Is it not absurd to talk of a raid by a Government responsible to the people, and who can remain in power only as long, as the people choose to allow them to doso? My own opinion is that the State Savings Banks will eventually be merged into the Commonwealth Bank, because depositors will find that the Commonwealth system offers better and wider facilities for those who wish to obtain interest on their hard-earned savings. One of the objections, to the present Savings Bank system is'that, ifa man requires to draw £ 1 0 0 or ^ 1 5 0 out of the Savings Bank, he must give at least a day and a half's notice. Why should any notice be necessary ? Sir JOHN. FORREST -Interest is paid oncurrent account with the Savings Bank, and the management must be given some notice of such withdrawals. 1 told that, in the case of the New Soutb Wales Savings Banks, such sums can be Time will not permit me to quote drawn without notice.

53,Mr Lairdsmith,"I have just beer*and borrowers greater facilities than the State Savings Banks offer; and'it will be free from certain influences which everybody must admit exist at the present time. The Associated Banks are so in touch with the Tory Governments in the various States that they are able to influence their Savings Bank management in a certain direction. Why is there any restriction placed on the interest earning amount which a man may deposit with the Savings Bank? The answer appears to me to be that, if there were no limitations, the Savings Banks would interfere with the business of the private banks. We have been asked why a Commonwealth Bank is necessary. Let me point out a few reasons. Banking is a system of credit built upon a very limited amount of gold, and the private banks consist of a few directors and shareholders. Those directors, managers, or shareholders, have control of the gold and of the credit. If they control the credit of the country, they control the business of the country; and if they control the business of a country, they must have the whole commercial system of that country in the hollow of their hands. They may close down on business men as well as on farmers and producers at any time and that is why opposition is being shown to the establishment of this bank, which will render it impossible for the private banks to continue such a state of affairs. We are asked where the capital of this bank is to come from. Where did the banks obtain their original capital ? I have not been able to obtain authoritative information on the subject; but I have gathered, from newspapers, that two of the most prosperous financial institutions in Australia started with very little capital. The actual capital that went into one of these was £200,000; and witliin the first fifty-three years of its existence, it paid over £6,000,000 by way of dividends. Another leading and progressive bank doing business in Australia had a capital of under £140,000 to begin'with. In the first fifty years, that bank paid over £8,000,000 in dividends. mentioned was the Bank of Australasia, and the second the Union Bank of Australia; and my authority is the financial writer of The Bulletin. these banks was, of course, shown in millions, but it was uncalled, and in the pockets of the shareholders. arose it would be found that not nine-tenths of the shareholdf rs had any money, as was the case in the ;risis of 1893. The tottering Bank of New Zealand was saved by the Government coining to its rescue with £1,000,000-exactl y the capital with which it is intended to start the Commonwealth Bank. But the Bank of New Zealand, like the Commonwealth Bank, has the credit of the State behind it ; and credit is all that is wanted. As to what banking generally is, I should like to quote from Macleod, who is, perhaps, the greatest authority on the subject. During my voyage to England and back I waded through Macleod with a view to fit myself to compete with the great intellectual financial authorities on the other side. It would be a good thing if the people knew what the system of banking really is in Australia to-day. The honourable membei foi Bendigo would have us believe that banking is really a matter of taking money in and lending it out, but, as a matter of fact, the profits are made by the buying and selling of paper. Macleod saysContrast between the common notions about banking and the reality. The '' common notions '' are the basis of all the arguments of honourable members opposite. Having now given an exposition of the actual facts and mechanism of banking, it will be as well to contrast the common notions respecting it with the reality. i . It is commonly supposed that bankers are dealers only in money. The fact is, that bankers are dealers in credit . 1 i i . It is commonly supposed that bankers act only as intermediaries between persons who want to lend and those who want to borrow. The fact is, that a banker is a trader whose business is to buy money and debts by creating other debts. i i i. It is commonly supposed that a banker's profit consists in the difference between the interest he pays for the money he borrows and the interest he charges for tbe money he lends. The honourable member for Bendigo, though I can scarcely believe it iepfesents his true opinion, would have us believe that he shares that common idea. The fact is, that a banker's profits consist exclusively in the profits he can make by creating and issuing credit in excess of tbe specie he holds in reserve. A bank which issues credit only in exchange The capital of for money never made, and can by no possibility make, profits. It only begins to make profits when it creates and issues credit in exchange for debts payable If a crisis at a future time, which, according to M ill , is robbery !",24,Second Reading

Hyndman shows that from 1843 every decade were brought about in the Old World by over-production and faulty distribution and exchange. the merchant or manufacturer, who is working on an overdraft, produces a vast amount of goods for which he cannot find a market; and the bank manager, hearing of the trouble, immediately begins to put pressure on his client. That is the first start of the crisis; and as soon as depositors in the bank get an idea that trouble is looming, they begin to withdraw their money. It is just here that the usefulness of a State Bank would be shown. If a State Bank were in existence the \Ve have heard a lot about the people, when they withdrew their money from the private bank, would not hoard it, but would lodge it in the State Bank, which would be placed in a position to Gold and silver regive stability to the other banks, and thus prevent a crisis. A State Bank would be pretty much what the safety-valve is to the boiler. bank do with the money thus deposited? tirely as a. layman, I fancy the State Bank, if it found that the bank in trouble Supposwas really substantial, and only required temporary capital, would come to its rescue; that is what I understood the Minister of Home Affairs and the honourable member for Balaclava to mean when they spoke about rediscounting. The refusal of banks to discount really paralyzes crisis of 1907. That crisis was felt everywhere except in Switzerland, and the reason for that country's immunity was the existence of the State Bank, which continued to discount at the same rates as before. Much has been said about American banking; but we know that there is really no system, there. There is no State institution ; ancl the Federal Government have to store their gold and bullion in their coffers. This was doubtless one of the reasons why the Judging from the speeches of crisis of 1907 did not come to an end sooner. Edmund Kelly, who is the great authority on that crisis, tells us that what That, however, is not so; he calls the "" Wall-street p u s h "" were able to corner the gold, and then proceeded to create a high rate of discount to the ruin of hundreds of people, inO'MALLEY The banks cluding the Knickerbocker Trust, the manager of which committed suicide owing to the refusal of the Wall-street bankers to permit him to clear through' their clearing-house.

I admit there is much in the argument against the appointment of only one governor of the proposed bank; but I am prepared to give the one-man system a trial, because it will be easy enough at any time to increase the number. No doubt the Prime Ministei and the Government have had excellent advice from those who should know all about banking, and the Prime Minister has taken the responsibility of placing the bank under the management of one man. That man is given a great deal of power, but is restricted in its exercise by being placed, to some extent, under the supervision of the Treasurer. If that were not so, I should certainly seek to have a clause inserted to protect the bank should the Governor decide fo make it a commercial bank. In my opinion the bank will be split up into several departments. We shall have first a bank of deposit, issue, and exchange; then there will be another branch for the great Department of Agriculture; a third branch will be the Savings Bank portion; and, finally, we may have a commercial branch. I am speaking now from my reading of the establishment of the National Bank of Japan, which alone enabled Japan to pursue her war with Russia to the end. That institution is divided into various branches. I believe that the Commonwealth Bank will not become a commercial bank in the sense that the present Associated Banks are. We have two different systems of banking carried on in Australia at present. I have the honour and privilege of acquaintance with a retired bank director, who was once a manager, having worked himself right up, and I have asked him if I am correct in regard to every one of the statements which I am making to-day. I am not so egotistical as to refuse advice. I find, then, that the Union Bant and the Bank of Australasia will not give certain people the credit that other banks will give, because they wish to keep their finances in a sound condition. Consequently they will discount only real bills. What was it that brought about disaster in most of the banks ? The honourable member opposite who laughs ought to know that many directors in those cases improperly secured overdrafts, particularly in my own State. This applies to the Van Diemen's Land Bank and others. The directors to whom I refer were in business, and got the banks to discount commercial bills, or bills which Macleod technically calls accommodation bills. When a bank begins to deal in accommodation bills, it is on very shifty ground indeed. I hope and trust that the manager of the Commonwealth Bank will never indulge in that system of commercial banking. That is why I say that no great number of the present commercial banks will be wiped out. A manager or managing director, speaking recently, gave excellent advice to Australian investors when he said he could see over-investment going on, and warned them to be very careful not to go in for a boom system such as was indulged in in the old days' to which I have referred. I do not think that we shall find the Governor of the Commonwealth bank indulging in that system of banking, which was brought about, to a great extent, by the directors, instead of the managers, managing the banks. Any bank that was content to be guided by the sound -financial expert who was its manager, weathered that crisis. It was the banks whose managers were over-ruled by the directors that went under. The managers had to suffer, but in many cases it was the directors who were responsible for the ruin, because they compelled the managers to grant overdrafts. the Opposition have been "" cracking up "" these marvellous directors. part they played in 1893. I was in conversation the other day with an old couple who were worth thousands of pounds when the banks broke, but who are now drawing old-age pensions. It is not at all likely that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank will take the risks that were taken in those days and that are probably being taken again to-day. Trouble has been caused ever since 1797 owing to bank directors over ruling managers and making advances on their own responsibility. I say, "" Leave the management to the manager, and do not let novices interfere."" After all, a director can only be a novice, considering his multifarious other duties, and cannot go into the details of bank management as a manager does. I therefore hope the day is far distant when we shall have for the Commonwealth Bank a Board of directors, consisting of men who have not had the training that they should have before they can run a great financial institution.

HadI had the opportunity of doing the same, I should probably have given the House much more of Ma.cleod and much less of Laird Smith. orahle member admits that he is not a working man. thing of the sorr. The honourable member, with the remarkable agility of mind which he has displayed during the discussion of this question, has jumped from one position to another, and is anxious to have an awkward interjection placed in my speech. I am a hard-working man, and rose early to do hard work this morning, in order to be ahle to be present to speak upon this question. the honourable member did not doto keep within the time limit which I have imposed upon mvself. The strictures which the honourable member passed upon members of the Opposition and on members of his own party who have addressed themselves to this question, were not altogether deserved. 1 hope tbe time is far distant when we shall take all our opinions as to discussions that take place in this chamber from leading articles in the daily press. I have listened to most of the speeches delivered on the subject, I am here to gain all the and venture to say that they were remarkable on account of the absence from them of the very elements which the honourable member endeavoured to make us believe were always present. There seems to be an honest desire on the part of honourable members on both sides of the House to discuss the question purely from the pracI have tical stand-point, and so 1 must at once join issue with the honourable member in regard to the way that he has libelled honourable members who have spoken. are on record. nately the people who have not the time or the inclination to read the official speeches at the valuation which one of ourselves may put upon them, as the honourable member for Denison has done in this instance. I regard this Bill as an attempt on the part of the Government to carry out the policy which was dictated to them by the Brisbane Labour Conference. It was at that gathering that the instructions were issued to the representatives of the Labour party to establish as soon as they had the power a Commonwealth Bank. That policy was largely shaped by the present Minister of Home Affairs. It was he who brought the subject before the Conference, and it was mainly owing to his exertions that it became a distinct part of the Labour policy. I regret to say that, once it was adopted, the member responsible for its adoption seems to have dropped altogether out of the subsequent consideration of the question Any one who has read the speeches delivered at that time in this House by the honourable member for Darwin-man y of us have read them, and I listened to them, because I had to-mus t have been struck with the completeness of the honourable member's knowledge.

The .general idea of the supporters of this proposal for a Commonwealth BankI give this as my opinion formed in conversation with members of the Labour party who support it-seem s to be that it is to take the place of the present banking institutions, because they regard them as being.unsatisfactory. They think that they have not done the work which' institutions of that character should do in such a community as ours, and that the work they have accomplished has been done at the expense and to the detriment of the people as a whole. That seems to be the idea underlying the proposals for a State Bank. for the stability of future banking. has not to be taken into our calculations, because the Governments of the States have always been prepared to support sound institutions; and the only institutions which came to the ground during the financial crisis were those of mushroom growth. Although a call was made on the others which was far beyond what they might have been expected to answer, they survived because the Governments stood behind them. close their doors; but the Government would not let them. ment of New South Wales acted very wisely under the circumstances referred to. It has not been in Australia as in other parts of the world, where Governments have not been ready to assist institutions in which the public was largely interested. The honorahle member for Denison instanced the case of two old-age pensioners who lost some thousands of pounds by the failure of financial institutions; but he did not say whether they were depositors or shareholders. Probably they were the latter, because shareholders suffered most by the bank failures. Losses of that kind will not be prevented by the establishment of thp Cnrrmonwenlth Bank. Human nature will remain what it is, and persons who have money to invest will always place-it where they are likely to get the highest return. There is, however, a general feeling that the Commonwealth Bank will lend inoney at lower rates than now operate, a I believe the view which is largely supported by honourable members opposite. It is said that the banks rob the people by charging high rates of interest, and that a Commonwealth Bank will charge lower rates, and will give higher rates for money placed on deposit. In my University days, when attending the natural philosophy classes, I heard the professor telling us that every year there was submitted to him an invention for establishing perpetual motion, and always in the same form: that of a large vessel containing water, which, pouring on to a wheel, worked a pump, which returned the water to the receptacle in which it was originally stored. Of course, it never worked. The people are being offered a similar invention in this proposal to give high rates to depositors, and charge low rates to borrowers. The tank at the top will be emptied in a very short time if an attempt is made to give effect to this policy. The Government, in proposing a Commonwealth Bank, is fulfilling its promises to the electors, and giving expression to class feeling; because, in some crowds, one would only have to say, ""There is a bank director,"" to hear the remark, "" Heave half a brick at him."" with which the honourable member mixes ? such as return the honourable member for Adelaide. There is strong animosity in some quarters against the banks; and, unfortunately, it is constantly being excited by the making of statements which have little foundation in fact. The banks have honestly and effectually carried on a very necessary work. to hear a remark to this effect, "" Here is a working mail, send for the police."" tion indicates the company kept by the honourable member for Adelaide. He is in a very Conservative environment if he finds such antipathy to the workers amongst his associates. In the circles in which T move, the working man is appreciated.

In the first place, they feel that the Bill is demanded of them by their electors ; and, in the secondplace, having had to suffer the discussions in the Brisbane Conference and in the Caucus, and their minds having been made up for them, they do not wish to hear anything more about the subject. I sympathize with them under the circumstances. able member for Gwydir would think our time much better employed in discussing the Postal Commission's report. I do not agree with those who say that the Prime Minister has been unfairly criticised for the manner in which he introduced the Bill.

I was under the impression that they always stood up for government by Statute. They have always opposed proposals whether contained in Bills or made by way of resolutions to provide for government by regulation, yet we find them taking no exception to proposals in this Bill for government by regulation of the widest possible character. The whole business of the bank is to be a matter of regulation, and the conduct of the Governor is to be determined in the same way.

The matter is a most important .one, because the affixing of the seal of a bank to a document involves the legality of its actions as a bank; but this, member ? too, is to be left to regulation. I wish now to allude to the question of Savings Banks. I do not agree with those who say that the present State Savings Banks are to be abolished as the result of the establishment of this institution. Like the honourable member for Denison, I desire to give the experience of my own State, but, unlike him, I do not wish to suggest that that experience is the experience of Australia. toria has established a number of branches, ancl these will continue to carry on even after what the honourable member for Parramatta has described as the Post Office office in Melbourne. I feel sure that theeviction has taken place. There are only 354 post-offices which act for and do business on behalf of the State Savings Bank, and according to the last report of the Inspector-General of Savings Banks the amount deposited in. respect of those Post Office branches is £1,207,000, as against £12,000,000 deposited in the remaining sixty-nine branch offices. It will be seen at once, therefore, that the real volume of the bank's business is conducted in the branches themselves, the Post Office agencies merely acting as feeders. It is estimated that the loss of new business to the State Bank, due to the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, will be less than the annual average growth of our Savings Bank business in Victoria, which amounts to £2,000,000 a year. It is anticipated that the total loss of business for the first year will not amount to more than £1,000,000. Commonwealth Bank will be established in our various post-offices,, and in that way will deprive the State Savings Bank in the first year of about £1,000,000 of additional business which it would otherwise obtain. suffer ? the outlying' districts. The Savings Banks, however, are not going to submit quietly to this sort of thing.

It will mean a great deal more time; and the honourable member who complained about the delay in securing withdrawals will find that delay much increased under the Commonwealth. I think I am justified in saying that the establishment of this bank will decrease the amount of new business done by the present Savings Banks. This, of course, will mean a decrease in profits, and that, in turn, will prevent any increase in the rate of interest to the depositors. It is news to me that there will be a run on the Savings Banks because of the creation of this Commonwealth Bank. I cannot conceive anything of the sort; and I It is anticipated that the do not know whence came the suggestion. headings in the Argus every day, such as "" A Raid on the Savings Bank."" members opposite always seem prepared ta accept newspaper headings and paragraphs as true.

There is no need to anticipate any run on the Savings Banks; but if a run does take place, the banks will be able to meet it.

In Victoria, in the Savings Bank, there is a very large and highly-trained staff; and this is a point to which I direct the attention of the Prime Minister. The right honourable gentleman will find it very difficult at the commencement of the operations of the Commonwealth Bank to secure for it that body of highly-gained men so absolutely necessary for the proper conduct My own of such an institution. Most-of our banking institutions have grown up very gradually, and the education of the officers has been a matter of careful attention on the part of those responsible for the banking business.

The very first effect of the passage of that measure was tofixthe rate of interest at 4 per cent. 1 I had something to do with many of the primary producers at that time, who had been passing through severe times to this measure is on quite different grounds. ber knows that what I am saying is quite correct. is correct. ber has not heard the other half. When that Bill was introduced, to my own personal knowledge, and I am certain to the knowledge of the honourable member for Wakefield, the rate of interest on a good many securities was 8 per cent. The moment that that little bank, mutilated as it was, became a factor in the financial world, the gentlemen who were charging 8 per cent, were told by their clients that they were going to take their business to the State Bank, which would lend money at A \ per cent. need for you to do that; we will let you have the money at 4 per cent.""; and this was done to the extent of scores of thousands of pounds, as the honourable member for Wakefield knows. that has nothing to do with our opposition It is not the scheme that took the States to this B ill . the arguments of to-day were the arguments right to be given to the States to come in of that period. The primary producer will as co-partners if they wish.

It must be conducted on the most economical lines, and at the same time provide cheap money for the primary producer-who, after all, is the greatest factor in the prosperity of this country. It is not to the amount of work which this bank will do for some years that I look for the benefit which the people will derive, so much as to the establishment of a rate of interest and scale of charges in connection with banking institutions all along the line. Whatever rate of They tried, however, to k i ll its interest wefixin connection with this bank, and whatever conditions we establish, we at once become a competitor with the existing banks. We are not inside of the bank ring,and no power can bring our bank within that ring. It will stand out distinctly as being conducted in the interests of the country as a whole. As an illustration of the effect of a step of this kind, a few years ago, a small State creamery was established in South Australia. The people were told by its opponents that this little two-pennyhalfpenny affair would make no difference to the dairymen; but personal inquiries in half of it the north showed me that, in many places, it made a difference of 4s. on the ordinary can of cream, because it established a fair price for the article. weeks.

It is not too late yet for the Government to take that question into consideration, beThey at once said, "" There is no cause I believe there is more wisdom in three men than in one at the head of a large affair like this.

138,Mr Poynton,"It was for far longerbut in South Australia at any rate, with the exception of the head office in Adelaide, the whole of the Savings Bank business is conducted in the post-offices. If we establish a Commonwealth Savings Bank in opposition to the Savings Bank in South Australia, without first making some arrangement with it, we shall either have to allow the two institutions .to be run together in every post-office throughout the State, each collecting its own moneys, or we shall have to deny the State Savings Bank the facilities which it has had in the past. tention ? Dr. Savings Bank has already been making arrangements in anticipation of it. a different arrangement will be made. I cannot see why the States should not be allowed to co-operate in the Commonwealth Savings Bank, utilizing tbe present facilities. much inducement in the past to approach the States. deter me from asking them again. Whatever the States may have done to us in the past is no justification for our doing affect the State Savings Banks now. We ought to approach the States or make it possible for them to avail themselves, so far as the Savings Banks are concerned, of the Commonwealth arrangements, and to participate in the advantages of the Commonwealth scbeme. I have already made my representations to the Prime Minister on that subject, and am now putting it upon record that I want that alteration made. I venture to say that there is a majority in this House who want it made, and. if I were on the floor of the Chamber, ] should certainly move in that -direction, but as I shall be in the Chair during thc consideration of the Bill in Committee, 1 desire now to put my attitude -on record. I still hope, and I do not think I shall hope in vain, that that alteration will be made. With that alteration, and, perhaps, <i reconsideration of the -question of whether nvre should be three men or one man at the head of the bank. I think we shall have a very practical usef u l bank, which, as it grows, will gather business. It is, however, not the business which'it-will gather, so much as the way in which it will regulate the conditions of banking generally, that will directly benefit the people. was rather pleasing to me to hear the last two speakers on the Ministerial side go'out of their way to congratulate the A ge on an article which appeared in this morning's issue. My reading of the leading articles of that able journal during the last two or three months has shown me that Ministers and the Labour party generally have been getting a very rough time indeed from it, and I can easily imagine the great delight which they felt when they read the article to which such kind reference has I do not think it is. been made. up. treated me very hardly. It has strongly criticized me at times, but I have been able to live under the criticism, as I hope I shall always be able to do. The honourable member for Grey accused the Opposition of not having the courage to vote against the Bill. I wish the House and my constituents distinctly to understand that I am absolutely prepared to vote against it. It is a B ill , not for the establishment of a bank on commercial lines, but for the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank anything which will injuriously with a distinct taint of the influence of politics about it. I have no hesitation in voting against any such measure, nor do I believe that any member of the party to which I belong would have any hesitation in voting against it. I should think that even those members on the Ministerial side of the House who talk so largely about the purity of political life, for which they claim to be to a .great extent responsible, ought to keep a great commercial concern, such as the Commonwealth Bank might become in the future, free from any political element. We know that political control is .not good either for the politicians, for the institutions controlled, or for the people. Commonwealth Bank be under political control ? stated that those 'elected to this Parliament from time to time will practically control the affairs of the bank, and the measure puts its 'government largely under the domination of the Treasurer of the day.

All we do is to criticise, and here, since the policy adopted is one in which we have told our constituents we do not believe, we are bound to oppose it. The Australian Notes Act is a very different measure from that introduced by the Government, and nearly all the amendments were made by the Opposition, but after the insult put on us by the Prime Minister, who said it was not the duty of the Government to supply information to the Opposition, I should feel disposed, if I had my way, to withhold Opposition assistance in perfecting this measure, for which, if it is a success, the Labour party will claim all the credit. We are being asked to put aside precedent, and to disregard the experience of other countries. All we have had in support of the Bill is the speech of the Prime Minister, who gave us nothing like the information to which we are entitled, and which is needed. AlthoughI am a member of a profession which pays great respect to precedent, I am not inclined ment. An Act was passed making bankto keep wholly to the well-trodden paths, especially in political matters.

The honourable member for New England and others airily disregarded the criticism of the Opposition, vernment undertook to pay sovereigns to but speeches like those of die honourable members for Angas, Bendigo, and others on this side are not to be disposed of in that fashion. They should have been met with arguments and information. I confess to a feeling of disappointment at such treatment of the criticism of men of ability The miners in my district were told that and experience. their experience, have not made a great success of their business from the people's point of view. able member for New England last night went out of his way to praise the banks. He spoke of them as magnificent institutions, which had transacted their business on the lines of the strictest honesty and integrity. ber for Denison held that the banks were not responsible for the trouble of 1893, and the honourable member for Mernda, than whom there is no more capable financial authority in this HouseI doubt if any other member could have made the speech which he did the other night-prove d that that crisis was not brought about by the banks. The reasons for it, given by the honorable member for Denison, were overproduction, and faulty distribution and exchange. flation of values by the banks. honourable member was intimately connected at the time with large financial transactions, or that he occupied a position then whichmakes his opinion on the subject very valuable. I give the late Sir George Dibbs all the credit to which he is entitled for the action he took; but he had the whole of the New South Wales Parliament behind him. I know that, because I was a member of the Opposition there at the time.

What is proposed is not a banker's bank,, nor an institution such as the people have been led to expect, which would give them cheap money and add to their happiness. a Commonwealth Bank would increase their comforts, and that their wives would never be at a loss for money on Saturday nights. I can fancy their disappointment when they hear of the institution that is really being established, and know that all that the Government is doing is to add another commercial bank to the twenty-two already in existence here. But it is a disappointment to us that the Minister of Home Affairs, who brought this matter so, prominently before the Brisbane Conference and before this House on various occasions, it being the dream of his political life fo establish a national bank, was not permitted to introduce the Bill.

I sincerely trust that these gloomy forebodings will not be realized; but I want to be shown that there is any real necessity for the establishment of this bank. Has there been any general demand for it? ' Have the people of Australia, by means of public meetings, or in any other way, indicated that they desire such an institution? I think not. It appears to me, -however, that it is very necesfurther, although I should have liked to sary, so far as the Ministry .themselves are concerned, that this Bill should be passed before we go into recess. One of the planks of the Labour platform provides for the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank. A Labour Conference is to meet next year; and, to justify themselves before that Conference, the Ministry must be' able to show that they have placed on the statute-book of the Commonweath a Bill to provide for a Commonwealth Bank in some form or other. Hence their anxiety. 1 know of no strong desire on the part of the public for such a bank as this Bill contemplates. We are told that we must consider the country in which we live. It is certainly very prosperous, and no one can deny that, throughout the length and breadth of the land, excellent banking facilities are afforded. I am not going to give the number of branches that have been established in various parts of Australia, not only by private banking companies, but by the State Savings Banks, to meet the requirements of our people. We know, however, that it is very considerable. It is said that the establishment, of this bank will enable the people to obtain money at lower rates of interest I do not see how that is to be done if, at the same time, the bank is to make the profits to which some honourable members opposite have referred. If those profits are to be earned and heavy expenses .paid, it seems to me that the rate of interest will be higher than many honourable members opposite contemplate, and certainly higher than those who supported, the Labour party at the last general elections, because of this proposal, imagined it would be. I should be prepared a.t once to support .the establishment of a bank that I believed would benefit the people, but has any one shown that this will do so? We are entitled to look to the Prime Minis-, Government and the Opposition; and if. ter for guidance in this matter; but in introducing this Bill, he did not bring forward any proof that the bank would benefit the people. I am prepared to admit that in carrying out our financial operations in London, as well as in Australia, the bank may be found useful in many ways,' so far as our public business is concerned. In that way it will probably be beneficial to the people; but we have yet to leam how it will directly benefit them. As I understand that several honourable members wish to speak, and that it has been arranged that a division shall be taken this afternoon, I shall not detain the House' criticise some of the details of the Bill The Bill should be referred to a Select Committee to enable us to obtain information that we ought to have in dealing with it. I am confident that the Ministry is setting out on A very dangerous course byallowing a commercial concern of this character to be mixed up with politics. It' should be kept entirely free from the influence of politicians, ho matter how honest they may be, and if it is to be successful it must be managed, not by one Governor, but by a Board. In one respect the Governor will be a sort of autocrat, whilst in another, he will be a mere puppet in the hands of the Treasurer. If the manager of the bank is to be no more than a puppet in the hands of the Treasurer of the day, then it will be a case of good-bye to all honest dealings so far as the institution itself is concerned. We have, in Australia, banking institutions pf the highest possible -reputation. They carry on their business in a way that is second to none, and while I am prepared to support the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank on proper lines,'. I cannot think of supporting a bank which,, to put the position shortly, will be established on a basis of a semi-political, character. I must express my sincere regret that the tens of ..thousands of electors who voted for the Labour party because of the promise that cheap money was to-, be secured for them by .the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank, are to be sub-' jected to bitter disappointment in connection with this Christmas box which the Government are now presenting to them.
