So we have gone from was Prime Minister and Peter Costello was very strong jobs growth for five to six years Treasurer, 2.2 million jobs were created-1.2 to very anaemic jobs growth in the nine million of those jobs were full time.

We saw this in action in the Senate today, and it was shameful. This is a move that will put further pressure on interest rates just as we are starting to turn the tide and just as we are starting to get some good economic news. It shows just how out of touch and how desperate the opposition are. We know that we face more tough times ahead as we continue to battle economic turbulence abroad and high inflation and interest rates at home. But still the opposition refuse to listen. The Reserve Bank warned the previous coalition government 20 times about capacity constraints in the economy, but they did not listen. They did not listen when in government to that respected and august body, the Reserve Bank, and still they refuse to listen to it in opposition. The other day in this House, I heard the member for Dickson talk about the great economic reforms delivered by his government-by the Howard-Costello government. What did they amount to? They basically amounted to some clever accounting skillsno significant economic reforms at all. That is the legacy-no significant economic reforms, just some clever accounting. The Labor Party has a proud history of building nations and making visionary commitments. Talk about committing the nation-we build nations. Those opposite, the Liberal Party, are prepared to bill the nation that Labor built. That is all.

244,The Speaker,"Order! It being 9.00Employment Services (Question No. 203) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in writing, on 26 June 2008: In respect of the Government’s proposed new Employment Services model: (a) what analysis was done to indicate that increasing the proportion of funding to more disadvantaged job seekers would result in higher employment outcomes; (b) what is the predicted associated increase in employment participation by highly disadvantaged job seekers (stream 4) as a result of this increased targeted funding; (c) what are the predicted employment outcomes for each of the four streams; and (d) what is the predicted duration of unemployment for each of the four streams. As the question falls under the portfolio responsibilities of the Minister for Employment Participation, the question was referred to Minister Brendan O’Connor for reply. Mr Brendan O’Connor-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) There have been several reports produced including “Customised Assistance, Job Search Training, Work for the Dole and Mutual Obligation A Net Impact Study” and the “Job Network Evaluation Stages2 and 3” which show that assisting the most disadvantaged clients achieves the best net impacts. (b) The web address: www.workplace.gov.au/ESpurchasing, provides a link to a range of information in relation to the Purchasing Arrangements of the New Employment Services 2009-12. This includes the estimates of the employment outcomes for Stream4 job seekers. As Stream4 represents a combination of cohorts from the existing employment services it would not be possible to provide comparisons of employment participation. (c) The web address: www.workplace.gov.au/ESpurchasing, provides a link to a range of information in relation to the Purchasing Arrangements of the New Employment Services 2009-12. This includes the estimates that relate to the honourable member’s question. (d) The Department has not forecast duration of unemployment for each of the streams. Housing Affordability (Question No. 205) Ms Ley asked the Minister for Housing, in writing, on 26 June 2008: (1) Can she release the results of research and/or modelling done by her department that indicate the likely take-up rate of incentives under the National Rental Affordability Scheme. (2) Can she outline when proposals submitted under the Housing Affordability Fund will receive funding. (3) Can she provide an update of the audit of Commonwealth Government land, including the location and description of parcels of land that may be released for housing supply. Ms Plibersek-The answer to the honourable member’s questions is as follows (1) The uptake of the National Rental Incentive under the National Rental Affordability Scheme will be determined by the budget allocations for the program. These allow for the allocation of the following number of dwellings across the forward estimates: 2008/09 3,500 2009/10 7,500 2010/11 14,000 2011/12 25,000. Allocation will occur through competitive selection rounds with capacity to forward allocate to future years. Three funding rounds will be held in 2008/09 to allocate the majority of the National Rental Incentives for the first two years, with the third round allocating for the third and fourth years. (2) The Housing Affordability Fund Consultation Paper released on 11 June 2008 includes the details of the timeframes for the Housing Affordability Fund. (3) The Government is committed to releasing surplus Commonwealth-owned land for housing. A revamped land release policy will require all Government agencies to show why surplus land should not be released for the benefit of local communities. The Commonwealth is currently finalising a revamped Commonwealth Property Disposal Policy (CPDP). The Commonwealth has recently released the following land for sale: West Wattle Grove, Moorebank, NSW Cannon Hill, Brisbane, QLD Schofields, NSW The Minister for Finance is responsible for the audit of Commonwealth land.",117,Eadra Is A Welcome One It Has Been Struction If Hitherto Absent Diseases Are Intro
