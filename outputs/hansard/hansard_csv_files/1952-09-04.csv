I cannot advance beyond that point yet. statement by the Minister for Commercb and Agriculture that the placing of new settlers on the land, with a view to increasing primary production, is a mattei for tbe State governments, will he con vene a meeting of State Ministers for Agriculture with a view to drawing up a uniform land settlement scheme similar to the War Service Land Settlement Scheme? would be served by a uuiform scheme of land settlement. I am constantly in communication with State Ministers of Agriculture through the Australian Agricultural Council, and they have agreed to a programme for the expansion of primary industries which involves the opening up of new farms. They and their governments know well that land settlement is the constitutional responsibility of the State governments. I have put it to them that, having regard to the economic needs of the nation, the State governments should, from the resources available to them, give priority to 3iich matters as transport services, &c, which, have a direct bearing upon the settlement of new areas, and the stimulation of primary production. However, no State government has indicated that it is willing to give such priority. [ am in constant contact with the State authorities, and I am sure that if they put forward any constructive suggestion as to how the Commonwealth can aid them in the discharge of their constitutional responsibilities their representations will receive serious consideration. It is not enough, however, for State .governments to select a particular activity .and then to ask the Commonwealth to put up the money for it. That is a course of .action which they are rather prone to follow. the Minister for Health by saying that 1 have been informed by certain people who are over 60 years of age, and who are not pensioners, that they have heard that, because of their age, they are not acceptable to insurance companies and therefore will not be able to participate in the full benefits of the proposed medical benefits scheme. Can the Minister-inform me whether that information is correct? If it is not, will he state thc facts of the situation ? already stated in this House, until three or four months ago most organizations which provided hospital and medical benefits imposed an age limit, but the major organizations, such as the Medical Benefits Eund of Australia Limited, the Hospital Contribution Eund of New South Wales and the Manchester Unity Independent Order of Oddfellows Friendly Society in New South Wales, which are very big organizations, have now removed the age limit and permit aged people to insure for both hospital and medical benefits. I , myself, am a little over 60 years of age aud I have been able to insure already. Minister inform me whether the Australian Loan Council has fixed a ceiling late of interest for government loans? If it has, will the right honourable gentleman inform me of that rate? Is the Prime Minister aware that the State Treasurers will not approve of loans the interest rate for which is more than £4 123. 6d. per cent, per annum? Is ho also aware that in Victoria it will be extremely difficult for government and semi-governmental bodies to raise loaii3 for public works because there is active competition from private concerns which offer interest rates between £4 15s. and £5 per cent, per annum ? honourable gentleman has any more questions similar to that, I think that they",13,Shipping

Are many permits being issued for the private construction of industrial plant, commercial buildings and accommodation? In the planning operation, has consideration been given to the future defence requirements of the area? M.r. HASLUCK -Some time ago the Government announced its decision to rebuild Eabaul on the existing site at Simpson Harbour. Provision is made in the Estimates now before the Parliament for the necessary expenditure including construction of the wharf. The details of planning and construction are entirely a matter for the territorial administration and the Acting Administrator, Mr affairs in the interests of the people, the Cleland, is pressing ahead with a good deal of vigour with the rebuilding of the town. Territories any jurisdiction relative to the money earned by aborigines as boxers or artists ? I am concerned that although men such as Dave Sands and Eon Richards have earned large sums of money they and their families have finally fallen into a state of destitution. The same fate has overtaken certain aboriginal artists. Is there any power vested in the Minister or his department to take control of the finances of such persons, and advise and protect them from exploitation? responsibility of the Australian Government in respect of aborigines is confined to tbose in the Northern Territory. Under the various ordinances of the territory, the employment of many aborigines is controlled through a permit system. When the employment of a native is so controlled we have a considerable responsibility for, and oversight of, his activities in order to ensure that he shall not be exploited and that any money that he earns or .possesses shall be properly used. Any aborigines who do not come within the umbit of the ordinances of the territory act as ordinary citizens of Australia and look after their own affairs. directed to the Minister for External Affairs, but if it is permitted I should like his answer to be supplemented by tlie Leader of the Opposition. Since provision was made ior Her Majesty's Opposition in this Parliament to be represented on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and since there is no sign except the apparent personal inclination of the Leader of the Opposition, that the Australian Labour party is likely to elect representatives to the committee, will che Minister take appropriate steps to till the vacancies on the committee from honourable members on this side of the House who are eager and willing to apply themselves to a study of foreign Parliament and the country? m the honourable member's question has been in my mind for some time. The only reason why theve has been a delay in filling the vacant positions with honourable members from this side of the House has been my constant but so far unrequited hope that honourable members of the Opposition would decide to join this extremely useful and effective parliamentary body, the Foreign Affairs Comrnittet. A great many months have elapsed since the committee was formed, and from various sources I had been led to believe that within a relatively short time the Opposition might reconsider its attitude. However, I believe that the time has come to accept the proposal made by the honourable member, that instead of wasting eight places on the Foreign Affairs Committee, that are at present unfilled, those places should be filled from this side of the House. That should be done, at least until the Opposition chooses to take advantage of this quite uniiue opportunity to increase its knowledge of vitally important international affairs.

I am grateful to the honourable member for raising this matter. partly addressed to me, may I indicate that if the Minister for External Affairs really wants the assistance of the Opposithe notice-paper so that a proper pretion on the Foreign Affairs Committee he might engage in a little exploration, and find and consider the proposal made by the Australian Ambassador to the United Percy Spender, to the effect that definite power be given to a committee such as this to do some work, instead of its authority being greatly limited. If the Minister desires co-operation from the Opposition, and is willing to form a real Foreign Affairs Committee with real power, then he should take the course that I have suggested. If he fills the positions as he has indicated he will do, no doubt honourable members on the Government side will learn a lot more about foreign affairs. I agree that they need to do so. Indeed it may be useful to add more members to the committee for that purpose. However, if the Government desires to have a committee that will operate from a non-partisan viewpoint, let the Minister reconsider what may be termed the Spender proposals. Then he might receive a ready response from ns to his suggestions. . Mr Speaker. I am concerned about the possibilities that emerge from the precedent that has just been established by the asking of one question simultaneously directed to two right honourable gentlemen on different sides of the House. There is a standing order that covers statements by Ministers from which debates may arise. It seems to me that the adroitsubmission of a question of the nature of that which has been asked by the honourable member for Riverina might lead to a debate between the two opposing sides of the House. gentleman's point of order is well taken. The Standing Orders provide that a rjuestion without notice may be directed to that he made some time ago concerning a Minister or a member in respect of any matter of wbich that Minister or member has charge. I am accustomed to hear six or seven questions asked of Ministers who make some attempt to reply to them, but the proper course of action would be to put the questions on the notice-paper. My personal view is that we have long since reached the stage at which every question should be placed on pared answer could be given to it. COAL.

As the honourable member knows, the commanding officer of the American forces is the Commander-inChief of the operations in Korea. Certain persons bave been appointed to conduct negotiations for a cease-fire agreement on behalf of the United Nations. The Government is kept in touch with those negotiations. In common with all other participants, we should like to see an armistice established on proper terms but, as the honourable member knows, there have been great difficulties in the way of achieving that result. External Affairs inform me whether it is a fact that the only issue which is delaying the proposed cease-fire in Korea is the repatriation of Chinese and other Communist prisoners of war held by the United Nations forces? view of the Australian Government on that position? Are any steps being taken by the Minister to obtain from the United Nations an authoritative ruling on the issue? Has the matter been reviewed recently in order to ascertain whether the obstacle to the truce can be overcome in that way? say that the only matter in dispute which is delaying the reaching of a cease-fire of war. The Australian Government adheres to the view, which is the view of the United Nations, that prisoners should not be forcibly repatriated. As the right honourable gentleman is aware, the matter of discussion and negotiation with the Communists in. Korea on this issue has been debated for a long time.

A study of the estimates, for the various defence departments reveals that in the current year, the Government proposes to spend £200,000,000 on -defence. That amount is 6 per cent, of the national The proposal provides for income. It is interesting to look back on defence estimates of the past two years and to note that the proportion of national income that is being spent on defence has been gradually increasing. In 1950-5:1', £148,OOO,0OOor 4.8 per cent of the national income was spent on defence. Last year; defence expenditurewas £170,000,000or 5.3 per cent, of the national income, and this year the proposed expenditure will be 6 per cent, of tbe national income. Unquestionably, defence expenditure is inflationary. It involves the expenditureof a large sum of money for which there is no productive return, and it is oneof the most potent inflationary factors affecting the present economic position.

59,(By Mr Kent Hugees) I N Committee Of Supply:' Considera,"such a large sum on defence, taxation could be reduced substantially and money could be spent in other directions where it is urgently needed. In view of tbe Strain that is placed on the economy by defence expenditure, we must ask ourselves whether it is justified. If we review post-war developments we must conclude that the western democracies, including Australia, have had no alternative but to rearm and build their armed forces as a means of maintaining peace and deterring the Soviet TJnion from plunging the world into another war. So far as I can ascertain, it is impossince the end of the war. In the first sible to discover the amount that is being spent by the Soviet Union on defence and its armed forces. Outsiders cannot obtain easily any information about happenings behind the I r o n Curtain, but those who have examined the subject and tried to piece together the fragments of information that are available, have calculated that from 40 per cent, to 50 per cent, of the national income of the Soviet Union is being expended on its armed forces. Unfortunately Australia and the other democratic countries have been forced to spend ou defence considerable sums of money that they would rather have spent in other directions. When World War II . ended, there was a remarkable feeling of friendship for the Soviet Union among the peoples of the western countries, despite the fact that the Soviet Union joined the Alliesi n the war, not because of a voluntary decision on its part, but because after the Russian alliance with Hitle r Germany, disputes arose between the rogues over the splitting of the spoils. As a result, Hitle r attacked telligence of the size of the Russian armed the Soviet Union, and Russia and the western democracies found themselves fighting against the same enemy. Because of that involuntary act of the Soviet Union we were allies. A f t e r the defeat of Hitle r and the Japanese, there was unthen continueddoubtedly an enormous fund of goodwill in all the western countries for the Soviet people, although they had been allied with Hitle r at the beginning of the war and the western people did not like many features of their regime. At the end of the war there was a greal rush to disarm. assembled over years disappeared in a Mr W. M. Bourke. few months. Everybody wanted to get back to civilian life. A i r forces were dispersed. All the western countries disarmed because ihe people wanted peace and hoped that they had seen the end of wars. But unfortunately we bave found that that period of happy thinking has passed and all the western countries are being forced to rearm. In my opinion, one factor alone has' induced the United States of America, Great Britain, Australia, and all the otlier democratic forces to rearm. That factor is the policy that has been followed by the Soviet Union place, the Soviet Union did not disarm or disband its forces as did the Allies. If time permitted, it would be interesting to examine the estimated strength of its armed forces. An y examination of the facts and the policies that the Soviet Union has pursued towards its neighbours proves how essential it has been for the democracies to strengthen their forces as a deterrent to the outbreak of another war.' I have here an extract from the London Times, which is regarded as a reliable, authoritative and independent newspaper. It contains the report of a statement by Mr Woodrow Wyatt, who was Financial Secretary to the War Officei n the Labour Government. Speaking at a joint Labour rally in Middlesex, he said that tliere were f a r too many people who underrated the need for defence forces, and he went onIf you give tliem figures of tlie size of Russian armed strength-and the strength of the satellites-the y do not believe them, because they do not want to believe them. The estimates by the British Military Inforces arc not guesswork. He pointed out that the BritishI n t e l l igence Service had accurately estimated tbe development of Germany's military strength between 1935 and 1939, and he I am sure I have given you enough to convince you that when the British Military Intelligence says that the Russians huve got 215 divisions-17 5 line divisions and 40 supporting anti-aircraft and artillery divisionsthere ave very good grounds for saying so. Those figures are supported by chapter and verse. No one but a fool would disregard these estimates. Armies that had been As an expression of my own views on this subject.

61,Mr Turnbull.',"What are the prosMT. DAVIDSON (Dawson) [11.23] I was interested .and heartened to hear the speech of the honourable member for Eawkner( Mr W. M . Bourke), who referred to the behaviour of the Soviet TJnion and its threat to world peace. I remind him that the situation which he described has been very much in the mind of the Government when developing its .defence policy. th»t fche behaviour of the Soviet Union since 'the termination of the war made it necessary for the Western democracies to rearm. With that view the Government readily agrees. The honourable member said that two steps might be taken to ensure peace. He outlined one of them, and I am sorry that time did not permit him to discuss the other. His first point was prefaced by an "" if "" which I feel must be underlined very strongly. The honourable member said in effect, "" If the Soviet Union could this Parliament visited the Territory of be prevailed upon, or would agree, to renounce its aims and to return to its own area that fact would force into the distance the possibility of a future war"". That is perfectly correct, but it must be appreciated that no government charged with responsibility for ensuring the freedom and the defence of a country could possibly base its policy on the assumption that the "" if "" which is involved in that proposition would become a reality. In view of the professed intentions of the Eussians, such a hope is entirely baseless. Obviously, the Soviet Union has no intention to do as the honourable member suggests it should do. I think that in fairness to him it should be said that he realizes that it is merely a pious hope which cannot be taken seriously into account. It was heartening to hear at least one honourable member opposite approaching such matters in a realistic way and acknowledging some of the facts. I could not help noticing the difference between his attitude and that of several other honourable members opposite, exhibited in questions which they asked in the House this morning. Those questions gave the impression that the honourable members -believe that the Government should consider commencing negotiations, without the support of other members of the United Nations, with the Communists m Korea. Such a suggestion is entirely untenable. The action that is being taken in Korea is designed to demonstrate to the Soviet Union that it cannot carry its policy of expansion any further. It is the first attempt to call a halt to the expansion of the Soviet Union, and it must be pursued right through and supported by all the members of the United The honourable member said Nations. There must be no suggestion that one member of that organization might be inclined to commence independent negotiations with the' Communists. I now wish to deal with an aspect of the development of the defence plan of this Government I refer to that portion of the plan which applies to the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. The plan provides that there shall be recruited and trained a Pacific Islands regiment. Eecently, honourable members from all political parties and from both Houses of Papua and New Guinea and had an opportunity to view the progress which has been made to implement that part of the plan. They visited the camp which has been established at Kaurama, several miles from Port Moresby, and were impressed by the splendid progress that has been made in the last twelve months by Lieutenant-Colonel Sabin and his staff of Australian officers and non-commissioned oflicers in the recruiting and training of native volunteers for the express purpose of enabling the natives to play a part in the defence of their .country. AVe found that not only was recruiting -proceeding very successfully, but also that the types of natives being recruited are very fine and are exhibiting the most commendable keenness. They are proving themselves to be excellent material on which to base the success of the scheme. If I may introduce a lighter strain to my remarks, it was particularly interesting and, indeed, exhilarating for those members of the party who had a little -Scotch blood in their veins, to find that after only six months bad elapsed a certain sergeant-major had obtained a set of pipes-whethe r from ordnance or from some other source. I did not inquire-and was rapidly building up a pipe band. The members of tbe party could not help 'smiling when, after having shut their eyes on hearing the pipes approaching. t'hey opened them to see all the paraphernalia of a pipe band, with the innovation that the puffed out cheeks were black instead of white. we were very struck with the progress that had already been made with thu establishment of this regiment, we found that two matters urgently require attention by this Government if the plan ia to continue with the degree of success with which it commenced. The comments that I am about to make are not based on information or complaints froin members of the staff of thc unit. They arise solely from my own observations and my personal knowledge of what is required in the establishment and successful training of a military unit. I found that the Australian officers and non-commisioned officers of the regiment were every bit as keen as were the troops they were recruiting. They were obviously seized with the importance of th« task before them. There is an urgent need for the provision of proper housinij for the Australian officers and non-commissioned officers. I found that the only housing available for the staff consists of huts and, in some instances, houses at Murray Barracks, several miles away from, the camp. When it is necessary for an officer or non-commissioned officer to bring his wife and family from Australin he must wait for many months before a house can be made available. Because of the fact that the buildings have been there sees the unit training and forming in for many years-the y were used for tb.« housing of troops during the last warthey are in a disgusting condition. It is necessary almost completely to rebuild them before they can be occupied. The floor of a building that I saw, and whicli had been recently takenover,, was completely rotted away. Tbe beams whicb carried the floor had to be taken out. Money bad to be expended on a dilapidated building which could not last very long in any event. In my opinion that 1 money was wasted. I believe that thc Minister for the Army( Mr Francis) will appreciate that it is essentialnot only to returned from a visit to the territory have, an efficient staff in an establishment and that he proposes to make certain such as this, but also to provide conditions recommendations regarding-the establishwhich will act as an incentive to the members of the staff to remain in the Islands. I understand that at the present time they go there for a year: If the living conditions for their wives and children are such that they will wish to return to Australia at the end of the year, a loss of continuity in the control of the unit will result, and this in turn will react adversely on the unit itself. No one could expect the wives and children of members of the staff to wish to remain there under present conditions. I submit that it is most important that something be done in that direction in order to ensure the continued success of the plan. It is also important that other training areas be established in Papua and! New Guinea. Up to the present timeonly one centre has been established! outside Port Moresby. It is obvious that other centres are required, preferably along tbe north coast of New Guinea ancl also in New Britain, round about Rabaul or Kokopo. Some diversity of the areas in which training is carried out is desirable ih order that the interest of the trainees may be held. They will very soon become bored if they have no other a.rea in which to train than the one in which they ai'e camped. If other centres were available the unit could put into operation a policy of rotation, between the various training centres. In addition, the establishment of other centres is desirable in the interests of the standing and prestige of the force. If the native population of the north coast their midst it will, be very much to the advantage of the whole plan. Finally, this is highly desirable for the strengthening of the defence potential throughout the area. Port Moresby would probably be the last position threatened in Papua and' New Guinea in. the event of any mo vement against us. Consequently we should establish centres near other towns to act as focal points in the event of defence becoming necessary. I understand from statements in the press that Major General Secombe, General Officer Commanding, Northern Command, has just ment o£ further areas there.

Eveni f the adoption of the recommendations would involve the expenditure of a sum additional to the proposed vote of £200,000,000. Hence, Australia must develop means by that has been proposed for defence, I consider that that additional expenditure, would be completely warranted. Another important matter is the development in the Territory of the Papua and New Guinea Volunteer Reserve, which is the equivalent of our Citizeu Military Eorces. The attempt to develop the Papua and New Guinea Volunteer Reserve seems to have been completely unsuccessful. During my short visit I was not able to discover the reason for this fact, but the provision that has been made for training the members of this force is completely unsatisfactory. saw one unit operating in Rabaul under Major Wilson, a man who obviously was very .well suited for the task, but he had only about eight men to train. Apparently certain factors are operating against the success of the Papua and New Guinea Volunteer Reserve and there is no real incentive for men to join it. I submit that particular attention should be given to this phase of our defence effort, which is vitally important. wish to deal with the Estimates for the Department of Defence. The Government appears to have very queer ideas with regard to defence. First it proposes to dispose of every instrumentality that would be required for the defence of this country if we were again challenged. I refer to such bodies as the Commonwealth shipping line, Glen Davis State Oil Refinery, Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and to the Government's destroy Trans-Australia Airlines while it permits the continued growth of an army of unemployed in this country. I have no objection to the £200,000,000 on defence provided the money is expended in a correct manner, but world events suggest the wisdom of radical revision of the principles that underlie the Government's defence policy. Australia's defence bas to be secured by Australia itself. The Labour party does not disregard Australia's obligations as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations but in view of the growing strength of other countries we can no longer expect Britain to ensure our safety. which to defend itself. That principle is the basis of Labour's defence policy. The vital need in Australia is to develop all its industries until every essential of defence can be supplied within the Commonwealth. This is not merely an industrial ambition. It has become a vital national necessity. Self-defence has become increasingly a matter of industrial preparedness. Australia must develop its essential industries in order that it may feed and clothe its forces and provide for their transport by air, land and sea. I Every branch of our armed forces must be assured of supplies of munitions. Consequently, munitions of all kinds must be manufactured in Australia instead of being imported from overseas. We need more docks, more aerodromes and more aeroplanes. We need oil storage facilities and an unending line of bases for tbe repair and refuelling of aircraft away from the coast. We must exhaust every possibility of exploiting the natural and artificial sources of oil, which is indispensable for effective defence. The closing of the Glen Davis shale oil refinery was a national tragedy and the Government is deserving of the greatest censure for having taken that action. The Labour party believes that continuous employment and the raising of living standards are essential conditions for effective preparation for defence. Australia must acquire the maximum of selfcontainment and self-reliance. The added security of the Commonwealth will also aid imperial defence. The principal means available for attaining greater attempts to local security are our land and air forces. Our Air Force should be developed according to the task it may be required to do both in reconnaissance and as a strikexpenditure of ing force. As defence is vital for the protection of the community it must not be allowed to provide a profiteer's market. The supply of munitions and other war materials must not be allowed to provide an opportunity for private profit making but sbould be kept under Commonwealth control.",23,Departmen T Of Defence Production
64,Mr Fuller (Hume) [11.37 ],"1SinceI returned to this Parliament 1 have been very concerned about the ratification of the Japanese Peace Treaty. On this matter I agree with the honourable member for Angas( Mr Downer), who has been in tbe clutches of the Japanese. In the tense international situation that exists to-day, the Labour party believes that a first priority must be given to the saving of the peace. Labour cannot accept the view that war is inevitable. Such an opinion, which appears to be shared by the present Government, indicates a feeling of the utmost despair and despondency. betrayal of the ordinary people and a mockery of statesmanship. Whilst there are many things in the world which must cause grave anxiety, there are some aspects which bring hope for the future. We all felt a flush of new confidence when independence was granted by the British Empire, as a matter of right, to nations such as India and Burma. By that one gesture Great Britain destroyed once and for all the spectre of British imperialism and the exploitation of the Asiatic races. Britain's decision was realistic, and indeed was inevitable. It gained the respect and friendship of great masses of the Asiatic people, and the admiration of the whole world. The thoughts of many statesmen throughout tbe world are becoming less selfish and more coloured by international optimism. Gradually world leaders are becoming convinced that we must ultimately organize some super national authority as a form of world government. Of course there are many cynics and reactionaries who decry and denounce the social progress that has been made in the world since 1945. Such people ridicule idealism. However, without idealism the peoples of the world cannot live as civilized human beings, and without the idealism of some statesmen of the past many excellent social conditions that we now take for granted would not exist. The Labour party's foreign policy is based on three cardinal points. We believe in complete support of the United Nations, because we consider it to be the only instrument that is capable of maintaining world peace. The Labour party also believes that war must be avoided at all costs, for it recognizes that with Japan. a tliird world war would cause civilization to totter, and that, moreover, tbe brunt of any such war would be borne by the ordinary people throughout the world. The third principle of our foreign policy is that Australia must not be laid open to external danger. It is with deep regret that Labour must endorse the opinion of the right honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Hughes) that the Government has been guilty of high treason in ratifying the Japanese Peace Treaty. The Labour party does not believe that the time has yet arrived to take Indeed it connotes a Japan back into the family of nations, because when we boil down all the speeches about the matter we discover the fact to be that only six years have elapsed since the second world war ended, l n that war our people suffered shockingly from Japanese aggression and brutality. In the Pacific war 31,000 Australian men were killed, 22,416 were taken prisoner, 2,475 were posted as missing and great numbers were wounded. The peace treaty repudiates the terms of the Japanese armistice. It is a mockery to those who died and to those who were maimed. It allows Japan to emerge once again as a great industrial power and to attack the living standards of the western peoples. The Labour party opposed the terms of the Japanese Peace Treaty as they were placed before this Parliament for ratification. If our standard of living be considered to be 100, the Japanese standard is only 6. Because Japanese production costs are at such an extremely low level, in any trade competition the Japanese must have everything their own way. The Labour party opposed the ratification of the Japanese Peace Treaty, and rightly so. We want a real and just peace with Japan and not one that will menace the safety of our country and the peace of the world. We wanted a treaty in conformity with the sacrifices made by this country during the last war. I remind honourable members that I am not alone in my opposition to the ratification of the Japanese Peace Treaty. The present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) thought much the same as I do when he spoke about the matter on the 19th October, 3947. He then saidWe cannot wait for a perfect state of affairs before we have discussions on a settlement Tkat view, I :thin(k, is on common ground -with the -views that I am putting myself.

When this debate was resumed to-day I was interested by the well considered observations of the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr W. M . Bonrke). He made it quite -clear that it was necessary for this nation to rearm, and quoted certain -opinions in support -of his argument.

As bad as any of those situations is the sinister Russian threat in Western Europe as the European summer draws towards its close. Good though our efforts under this Government may seem, they do not compare favourably with those of our Allies. current financial year, we in Australia propose to expend, according to. my computations, £2i per capita on defence. But ouv friends in the United States of America, who are making a tremendous contribution towards the stabilization of the world, plan to expend on defence this year no less than £130 per capita. Our kinsfolk in Great Britain, notwithstanding the privations and physical destruction that they suffered during World War II . , and their malnutrition to-day, are prepared to expend £36 per capita. Our sister dominion of Canada has planned to expend over £50 per capita on defence services. Therefore, let us not be deterred by the markedly high' figure of £200,000,000 that the Government has planned to expend, on defence this year and regard it as an expense bogy. The worse mistake that Australia can make in these days is to complain about any possibility of extravagance in our defence preparations. Should honourable members and Ministers decido that the burden of the budget is too heavy, it would be wiser for the Government to float a specific defence loan than to entertain any ideas of retrenchment or false economies. Another matter that I take the opportunity to discuss at this stage affects the Royal Military College at Duntroon. The efiiciency of the eollege is well known throughout Australia, and I think that honourable members who have been fortunate enough to witness some of the parades there will give enthusiastic testimony in support of it. I suggest-and I expect that my remarks will be supported by other honourable members who have served in the Army-that , notwithstanding the excellences of Duntroon, the prot ducts of thia college have suffered hitherto from one defect. Duntroon oflicers have shown a lack of quality in human leadership, and human relations. At any rate, that was the experience of many of us who served in the Eighth Division during World War II . Their technical knowledge was undoubtedly high and their parade ground drill and general proficiency were faultless. Nevertheless, it seems to me that, in the past they have suffered from a lack of humanity and understanding of the point of view' of During the troops who, in war-time, are recruited from the great body of civilians. I suggest, as a remedy for this defect, that Duntroon cadets be required to undergo a short period of training in nationa.1 service camps or with the Citizen Military I'orces. The period need not be so long as to interfere seriously with the curriculum at the Royal Military College. now. have that assurance from the Minister for the Army( Mr Francis). I understood that some beginning had been made with & scheme of that nature, and I am delighted to know that it has come fully into operation. apply to cadets training for technical units, who go direct to universities. system that has been initiated, apparently under the direction of the Minister, will go a long way towards removing the objection that I have mentioned. If Duntroon cadets, as a result of mixing with men recruited essentially from civilian walks of life, become humanized before they leave the college, less authoritarian, and less Prussian, one might say, in their bearing, then the Royal Military College at Duntroon will become one of the finest military acadamies in the world. able members on both sides of the chamber naturally are always concerned about the adequate defence of Australia.

72,Mr James (Hunter) [12 A,"} -Honoriis. The manufacturing city of Newcastle made an outstanding contribution to the Australian war effort. Newcastle may be described as the Birmingham of the southern hemisphere. However, the great industries of that city could not have produced war materiel unless they had had adequate supplies of coal. The Curtin Labour Government, when it assumed office after the Liberal-Australian Country recipients would receive an amount party Government bad failed to provide for the adequate defence of Australia, immediately began to organize the production of coal and munitions. I was appointed the Commonwealth Coal Liaison Officer between the Government and the miners, and I do not boast when 1 say that I did a great job in keeping tbe mines in operation. coal was produced. 1.942, partly as the result of my efforts, was a record, which was. not surpassed until last year, when a considerable quantity of coal was obtained from opencuts. The underground mines were the only sources of the supply of coal during World War IL , and the output from tbem in 1942, when I was Oommonwealth Coal Liaison Officer, has not since been exceeded. I shall now refer to various matters that are agitating the minds, and aggravating the feelings, of members of the mining community. I have mentioned these matters in this chamber on many occasions, but my submissions have been ignored by the Government. I have frequently endeavoured to elicit why the Government has permitted the Joint Coal Board to sell £10,000,000 worth of machinery. machinery could be used for open-cut mining, and the Prime Minister( Mr vented the miners from going to the war. Menzies) replied to the effect that it would not be of any use for underground stowage although it was suitable for gathering the material on the surface to send down the mines for stowage. I was perfectly well aware of that fact; the right honourable gentleman was not adding to my knowledge of mining. 1 had not suggested that the machinerv should be used for stowing purposes. I also mentioned, oh another occasion, that I had received from the general secretary of the miners' federation, Mr George Grant, a telegram asking me whether a conference could be arranged between the New South Wales Minister for Mines, Mr Arthur, and representatives of the miners' federation, and the Government, to discuss a proposal that miners' pensions be subsidized so that equivalent to the age pension. The Minister for Social Services( Mr Townley) replied that he had already received a deputation on that subject. He should not have dismissed the request so lightly. If a satisfactory agreement could be reached, retired miners would encourage their sons to seek employment in the industry and increase the output of coal, or even to go to war, if the Government would permit them to enlist. I know perfectly well that miners were not permitted to enlist for military service during World War II . They preferred to enter the services to working in the underground mines. I have dealt with that matter on a number of occasions. The Australian war effort required coal, and every miner was needed to produce it. One essential factor in national defence is the maintenance of contentment in the mining community. Miners should be encouraged to produce as much coal as they can. not do so. the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) is talking rot. The miners are more patriotic, brother, than ever you knew how to be. Make no error about that! The number of enlistments from the mining community was proporI asked whether the tionately greater than those from any other industry, but the Government preThe miners are patriotic. They are prepared to shed their blood on the battlefields, or in fighting for conditions to which they consider they are entitled. Government supporters urge the introduction of a system of incentives in order to increase the output of various industries.

I listened with interest to the speech of the honourable member for Dawson( Mr Davidson), who recently visited the Territory of Papua and New Guinea with other honourable members. For a long time, the Government has had under consideration the development of the defences of the territory.

Let me now make a passing"" reference to the observations of the honourable member for Pawkner( Mr W. M. Bourke). It is a treat in these difficult ahd troublous times to find a member of the Labour pa rty with sufficient courage to get up and say withoutany reservations or qualifications that the international situation is have thought 52 years ago Ehat, in the In accordance with the Government's (a) A field force for operations at home or abroad as may be required.

Army policy also provides for maintaining Australia's contribution to United Nations forces, and this at present takes the form of two battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in the first Commonwealth Division in Korea. I do not need to elaborate on the splendid work that these battalions have done. They have been trained, equipped, and led by Australians in accordance with the defence policy of the Government, and there are no better units in the United Nations' forces in Korea. Our policy also provides for(a) The full-time training of national service men, in three annual quotas.

(c) The day-to-day maintenance of these forces, and of other essenby the 13th December next, when the tial organizations in Australia, including the preparation of a home base for the forces to be raised and maintained on mobilization. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the many tributes that have been paid iu this Parliament and elsewhere to the efficiency of national service trainees, aud to the manner in which they have responded to their training. T congratulate the. trainees themselves, and also the officers and instructors who are responsible for them. The national service training scheme has made an important contribution to the defence of Australia, and has greatly benefited the youths who have undergone training. The Army Estimates have been increased by about £20,000,000, much of which will be absorbed by increases of pay and allowances to members of the forces. The strength of the forces has been increased. strength of the Permanent Army has been raised from 22,000 men to 28,000 men. This increased strength, together with increases of pay, will, account for the £6,500,000. Expenditure on the Citizen Military Forces and on the national service training scheme is estimated to increase by nearly £3,000,000. In our training scheme we aim to instil into all Mr Francis. ranks the qualities of self reliance, toughness, and discipline, and to instruct meu in the proper use of weapons. At a variety of military training establishments, such as those at Wacol, Brighton, Swanbourne, Kapooka, Ingleburn, Puckapunyal, Woodside and Singleton, recruits undergo an effective course of training, and have proved themselves to be very keen and aiert. The Army is now highly mechanized, and we are continuing with the policy, which was inaugurated by the Labour Government, of training Army apprentices. Difficulties were at first encountered, but most of them have now been overcome. From the training schools technicians of many kinds are being turned out, including electrical mechanics, and men trained in the maintenance and repair of arms and military equipment. Trainees are qualifying at the rate of 100 a year, and we hope that, marching-out ceremony will take place, another 100 fully qualified men will be available for service in the Army. The officer cadet school that was recently established at Portsea is passing out officers at the rate of 70 each six months. We hope to increase that number to 100 or 120 each six months in order to make up for the great dearth of junior officers in the service to-day. Indeed, there appears to be a dearth of junior officers the world over. I bave examined this problem, and it seems that the United Kingdom, American and Canadian forces have taken a course similar to that taken by tbe Australian forces. I am delighted to say that the officer cadet school is making extremely good progress. We have also established at Mildura an officer cadet school for the Women's Royal Australian Army Corps so that we may be able to cope with the organization consequent upon the enlistment of recruits in the For instance, the corps. I hope that we shall have no difficulty in maintaining a steady flow of recruits into this vital branch of the service, so that it will be possible to divert to other pursuits men who otherwise expenditure of an additional would be engaged in non-combatant duties. Special efforts are made to train the senior officers of the service. Army head-quarters exercises are conducted each year. The Chief of the General Staff conducts special courses for all senior officers of the Australian Military Forces. As an indication of the desire of the Army to keep abreast of the expansion and development of the arms with which . to defend the country, modern techniques are being adopted. A parachute training wing is being formed at the School of Land-Air Warfare. We are also establishing an air-borne platoon which will be available to aid the civil authorities iu fighting fires and in meeting other calamities. In addition, we are inaugurating the Army's own light aviation training wing. We believe that the Army has two functions to perform, one in peace and one in war. In warfare, the obligation of the Army is to defend this country and to drive off the enemy, wherever it finds him it has to attack him. In peace, the function of the Army is to go to the aid of the civil community in time of national crisis. That function has been performed frequently during the last few years. For instance, as many as 50 army "" ducks"" have been operating all over the country rescuing people who were sitting on housetops or were otherwise affected by floods. The Army engineering and signalling units also render every possible assistance to the community in flood, fire and tempest. From persons all over Australia expressions of appreciation have come of the splendid job performed by the men of the services in coming to the aid of people who have suffered as the result of such calamity. The national service training scheme bas gone ahead splendidly. It is expected that by 1954 100,000 national service men will have been trained. The expansion of national service training has shown that the limited number of Citizen Military Forces units is hopelessly inadequate to absorb all the national service trainees who are being trained. beginning substantially to expand the Citizen Military Forces.. I wish very briefly to give to the committee an indicaKorea. These officers probably will leave tion of the magnitude of that expansion. Tn addition to the 86 units that havs been established, we hope to establish during the present financial year a further 279 units. These will include signals, medical and ordnance units. Some of them will be relatively small units, but the larger ones will be units of artillery, engineers, infantry, supply, and transport. The allocation of such units wiil be: Queensland 53, New South Wales 73, Victoria 82, South Australia 40, Western Australia 23, and Tasmania 8. Naturally, the establishment of these units will impose a great strain on our resources, because drill halls and accommodation will have to be provided, and officers and non-commissioned officer instructors will be required. However, I ara convinced that the basic organization that has been set up will permit such expansion to be undertaken successfully. I wish to pay particular attention to the Citizen Military Forces because I believe that, particularly during the last two years or so, they have done a splendid job. Had those forces not been organized, trained and equipped, we could not possibly have established national training as successfully as it has been established. As soon as national service trainees complete their basic training they go into the Citizen Military Forces. The oflicers, non-commissioned officers and, indeed, the soldiers of the Citizen Military Forces have been the hard core on which we have developed national service training. If we had not had those officers, non-commissioned officers and private soldiers who were willing to co-operate fully we could not have welded the national service trainees and the Citizen Military Forces into one organization, nor could wchave gone ahead with the national service training scheme. In spite of the hostile and most unworthy and unjust comment that is made from time to time, I believe that the Citizen Military Forces have played a notable part in assisting national service training. Recently the Government approved of an officer of the Citizen Military Forces in each State of the Commonwealth being For that reason we arcselected to go to Korea and to join our forces there in order to observe the kind of warfare that is being conducted in Australia on the 16th or the 19th of this month and will be assigned to units in Korea. I hope that after having been virtually on active service with our forces for three or four weeks they will be a tower of strength to the Citizen Military cism as being merely attacks upon defence Forces when they return. Expenditure on arms and equipment has been a source of concern to the Government. However, I am happy to say that the most modern and up-to-date arms and equipment from all quarters of the world have been acquired by the Department of the Army. It is proposed to expend in the current financial year £5,600,000 on the purchase of armoured fighting vehicles, mechanical transport and spare parts, £1,600,000 on arms and munitions, and £2,100,000 on telecommunications, signals, and engineering and survey equipment of the most moder.n kind. Such equipment has been approved at the last moment, after long experience by trial and error in Great Britain and the United States of America. Expenditure on clothing will amount to £7,000,000, and £8,600,000 will be expended on the purchase of camp equipment and general stores, and on maintenance and general repairs. One of the greatest problems is that of financing are made and the goods are supplied in due course. current financial year, because of rising costs, the Department of the Army will receive more bills than it expected to receive. Nevertheless, the equipment is being kept up to date. Erom time to time the Chief of the Imperial General Staff informs us of advances that have been made with equipment, and I am happy to say that all the equipment that is being used by our forces in Korea is of the most modern kind. Sitting suspended from 18.U5 to 2.15 p.m. liropose to deal with the sevrice departshould be made as soon as possible. But ments. Eirst, I wish to comment upon certain remarks that were made by the Minister for the Army( Mr Francis) and some of his supporters. In almost every debate in this chamber, honourable members opposite curiously fall into the error of blaming the Opposition for being an Opposition. That is particularly so in relation to debates on defence Military College at Duntroon. I could not matters. variably accuse the Opposition of having no interest whatever in the defence of this country and they regard valid, critirather than upon the Government's methods of conducting the defence of the country. I find it had to understand the origin of this line of reasoning. It is well established that the present Government and preceding governments of similar calibre and party flavour were removed from office because of their inability to carry on the defence of the country. That fact is on record. Therefore, I cannot comprehend why Government supporters must always find fault with valid criticism that is offered by inember s of the Labour party on defence. In 1941, the government of the day did not have the confidence of the people in respect of its conduct of World War II . As a Labour government was entrusted with the defence of this country during the most difficult days of that conflict, it is idle to say that the Labour party, and the Opposition that represents it in this chamber, has not a wide knowledge of defence matters. Apparently, honourable members opposite an army. Usually contracts have difficulty in getting their facts straight, and, consequently, any comment However, in the from the Opposition must be completely sweet and reasonable if it is to find any echo from them. Too often. Government supporters howl down valid, solid criticism on defence matters as something that is almost subversive. However, the curious thing about this debate is that the hottest criticism of the Government has been voiced by some of its own supporters. The honourable was hard on the Government in respect of courts martial. He asked for ref onus in that respect. I believe that such reforms are long overdue and the speech of the day was that made by the honourable member for Angas( Mr Downer), who, after having traversed foreign affairs in relation to defence, dealt with the personnel of the Australian Begular Army. In the course of his remarks he made some rather trenchant and surprising statements about the Royal Government supporters inhave imagined in my wildest dreams that a supporter of a non-Labour government would think of saying that Duntroon",30,Departmen T Of Defence Production
87,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [2.15],I,34,Departmen T Of Defence Production
88,Inember For Bowman ( Mr Mccolm),"turned out officers who were Prussianminded. I did not hear any cries of anguish from that honourable gentleman's colleagues when he made that statement. His criticism may spring from the old argument about the relative merits of ithe civilian soldier and the regular -soldier. In my view, the Royal Military -College at Duntroon is one of the most democratic of its kind that exists in the free world. There may be a certain degree of rigidity in its training methods; but one cannot truthfully describe men who are trained at Duntroon as being Prussians. We have no evidence that the Government is absolutely opposed to Prussians. Indeed, under its immigration scheme, it proposes to bring .10,000 Prussians into this country in the near future. Would Government supporters describe as Prussian-minded, persons like General Eowell, Lieu'teaant-General Eobertson, who is now -Director of Eecruiting, General Woodward, General Bridgeford, General .Berryman and General Chapman, or -General Vasey who, unfortunately, was a war casualty? general in the Australian Begular Army is a product of Duntroon, and each of them has outstanding qualities. ber surprises me. The interjection by the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) is further evidence of the truth of my statement that Government supporters must always find something wrong with the Opposition's point of view and hotly contest it. Is it not curious that the Government and its supporters should find something wrong with one of the best military institutions that exists in the free world? The Royal Military College -at Duntroon is not a ramrod institution. Entry to the college does not savour of the old school tie. Perhaps that may be the trouble so far as honourable members opposite are concerned. Labour government close the Royal Military College at Duntroon? did close the college at one stage, but not because it thought that the college was rearing a race of Prussian soldiers. It took that action because of financial difficulties; and if this Government does not watch its finances it will be obliged to close down not only the Royal Military College at Duntroon but also many other institutions. The Vice-President of thf Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) must have glowed warmly when he heard one of his colleagues say that we were producing Prussians in this country, because he, himself, is the very model of a Prussian in the political sphere. I desire, now, to deal with defence in its broader aspects. Grave difficulties confront the Government in respect of the general over-all problem. The Labour party does not contest the proposed vote of £200,000,000 for defence for the current financial year but it does wish to ensure that that money shall be expended carefully. As this debate proceeds, one is alarmed about the non-committal attitude thar, the Government has adopted towards the problem of defence as a wbole. Now that full employment has disappeared as a result of the Government's To-day, every general policy, the Government finds itself obliged to curtail drastically the intake of immigrants. Indeed, it' is not improbable that it may have to abandon immigration altogether until snch time as immigrants who have already ar lived can be absorbed into the community. Our potential enemy, using the term in its broad and general sense, is to the north of Australia. We are aware of the hodge-podge of unrest that exists in Eastern countries. Immigration offers some possibility of increasing our man-power in the south, both for production and for defence; but under its new policy the Government will obtain little, if any, more man-power from overseas. Therefore, it must now come to a decision on Australia's role in. any war in the future. At present, we rely upon security pacts and the strength of the TJnited Nations; but we must decide on the function Australia will perform in tbe Pacific in the event of an outbreak of war. Are we our man-power or are we to feed the armies of our allies? Or, are we to clo a little of both? The Minister has not taken the committee into his confidence",34,Departmen T Of Defence Production

92,Mr Haylen,"A Labour governmenton that point. We do not know whether Australia is to be converted into a great staging camp, or whether we are to strain our man-power resources to the limit as we did in WorldWar II . , to the detriment of food production. Or, are we to be a vast food-growing army behind the lines, as it were, with limited commitments in respect of our Army, Navy and Air Force? Are we to try to do two things, and fail to do either effectively? What arrangement has been made with our allies, the British and the Americans, in respect of these matters? How far are vve getting away from the belief that Great Britain has honourable commitments in the Pacific? Are we giving the Motherland the cold shoulder? These are matters of high policy. My own view is that in the future we should not again attempt to undertake both a vast food production programme and a terrific services programme. The Minister for the Army has made a comprehensive statement on the individual items of army He is doing a very good job as far as the Army is concerned. It is very pleasing to find that the national training scheme has been so universally accepted. A man has his own right to eat his own words, so I am entitled to say that I did not think the universal training scheme would succeed as well as it has succeeded. But I should like to know whether there is imagination behind the plan. Since the advent of the atomic bomb, strategy has been blown to bits. We do not know what may be the form of any future war. Are the trainees receiving modern training, or are they being marched to the top of the hill, and then marched down again, in the words of the redoubtable ""grand old Duke of York "", which many honourable members sang in their heyday? We do not know the equipment they are using, the training they are receiving, or the purpose of their Is the general overall plan of defence the one that was decided upon in 1947, after the Chifley Government had consulted with the Chiefs of Staff of the allied nations? be getting too far away from the accepted ideas of training. For instance, I cannot see the connection between Mr Haylen. inner-spring mattresses, curtains, rugs at the bedside, and Bendix laundries, and modern fighting weapons. It is all very well to have all these furbelows, but they involve extravagant expenditure. Let us engage in military research and get to know the equipment that we may have to use in tbe future, ancl by all means let us have guns before bed curtains. The recruiting advertisements read like an advertiser's dream. They invite young fellows to join the Army in order to obtain better wages and conditions, and, indeed, everything they may desire. But, behind that lacade, the face of the sergeant-major rears in genial laughter. Let us be factual. The army has not changed to such a great extent. To-day, when there are very few jobs available, men who try to get into the Army find that the standards for entry have been stiffened. Although they may be willing to enlist for perhaps twelve years, they are not in the race to get into the Army because expenditure. the standard of entry is too high. It was reported in the press yesterday that many of the 3,000,000 Americans who were recently called up for service in the United States of America are unfit. Why not lower the standard of entry to the Army as an incentive for men to enlist? Why has the Government decided at this time, when adequate man-power is available because of the unfortunate incidence of unemployment, to make it more difficult for men to get into the Army? When a period of full employment returns, and high rates of pay are offeredas an inducement for men to enter industry, I suppose the Government will lower its standard of entry into the Army. The Government's present attitude is quite foolish. We do not want our Army to be full of crocks, but some of the inhibitions and prohibitions against men joining the Army are of a minor character. The standards which govern minimum height and chest measurements are too training. rigid. Such things as foot trouble and bad teeth could be overcome by corrective methods within the Army. Although the Government has made it hard for men with such disabilities We seem to to enter tbe Army, it denounces our young people for not joining up in sufficient numbers. There is something radically wrong with the Government's approach to recruitment. I shall refer now to the Royal Australian Navy. I should like the Minister the committee on happenings in the Navy during the past few weeks. three weeks ago a Fairmile launch was to be towed to the Solomon Islands. Itleft Sydney in tumultuous weather. Then a. hawser broke, or became disconnected, and the Fairmile ran on to the rocks. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -Orde r 1 The honourable member's time has expired. mend the Minister for the Army( Mr to the Government to decide matters Francis) for giving to the committee a fairly comprehensive survey of his department's activities so early in the debate on this proposed vote. I hope that the Minister's good example will be followed by other Ministers in order to obviate a lot of discussion and so reduce the work of the committee. I realize that details of proposed expenditure by the Department of the Army could not, for security reasons, be made public in the way that details of the prowere minor differences of opinion about posed expenditure by other departments can be revealed. About half a dozen matters that I had intended to raise were explained by the Minister, and it is now unnecessary for me to mention them. The honourable gentleman stated that it is the intention of the Government to expand the number of Citizen Military Forces units. believe that this is vitally necessary. If service trainees were being trained on training facilities were provided in more country towns reasonably close to the homes of our young people, I am sure that there would be an increased rate of enlistment in the Citizen Military Forces. Prior to 1939 small militia units were located in many small country centres, and many young fellows who were keenly interested in military training joined them. Periodically the small units combined to form bigger units, and tbe training was a great success. A reversion to that system would undoubtedly result in the recruitment of many' more young fellows in the Citizen Military Forces. I hone that the Minister's announcement in this connection will be implemented as soon as possible. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) stated that the Government, blamed the Opposition for being in opposition. After suggesting that the Government should adopt a different attitude, he devoted no less than seven About minutes of the fifteen minutes allowed to him in this debate to a condemnation of the Government on party political grounds. Nobody blames the Opposition for being in opposition, or suggests that honourable members opposite have not a right to criticize. The people of this country look to the Parliament rather than of vital national importance, and the people certainly criticize the Opposition for its lack of determined unity on defence. The honourable member for Parkes accused the Government of adopting a non-committal attitude to defence. I suggest that the honourable gentleman examine his own conscience upon that matter. If this Parliament were able to present a united front to the nation and to say that, although there the methods that should be adopted, all members of the Parliament believed that it was necessary for the Australian people to accept their responsibilities for the defence of Australia, undoubtedly we should make a real advance. In reply to the inquiry of the honourable I member for Parkes on whether national modern lines or on old-fashioned lines. I point out that the Minister for the Army has invited honourable members to visit the camps in which the trainees are undergoing training, and to see the conditions there for themselves. kitchens. Army officers in Western Australia are only too pleased to show members of the Parliament everything that is being done in the camps. They know that they have a responsibility to "" sell"" the national service training scheme to tbe people of Australia, because it is of vital importance. Let the honourable member for Parkes prove his interest in the scheme by visiting a national service training",35,Harbison Di D Not A To Supply Fighting Forces To The Limit Oi

I suggest that he do that, not only to ascertain whether the training methods meet with his approval, but also to encourage the trainees. I assure the honourable gentleman that it greatly encourages the trainees to know that the legislators of this country are interested in the work that they have been called upon to do. Many trainees are, at first, unwilling participants in tlie scheme, but, when their training has finished, they leave their camps as enthusiastic supporters of it. I suggest that the honourable member for Parke3 adopt to the national service training scheme the attitude that he suggests should be adopted to it. The scheme is too important to be approached on party liues. I am prepared to argue with the honourable gentleman about points of dqtail upon which there are narty differences, but, surely to goodness, no inember of any party other than the Communist party-and I do not call that a political party-doe s not, in his heart of hearts, realize that it is necessary for the Government to take drastic action as soon as possible to place this country in a state of preparedness. Let the members of the Opposition be honest and admit that that is so, and let them cease criticizbetween the attitudes adopted to defence ing the Government for the purposes of party gain. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr W. M. Bourke) approached the problem of defence honestly and not in a spirit of criticism. He asked whether defence expenditure was justified. I, too, have asked myself that question. He went on to say that it was justified. To prove that that is so, all that one needs to do is to point to the dangers with whicb we are confronted overseas. If members of the Opposition acknowledge, as the honourable member for Fawkner does, that some expenditure upon defence is necessary, I ask tbem to assume that a member of their family has been taken ill and is at death's door, and then to ask themselves what cash value they would place upon the life of that loved one. ""What is the cash va]ue of the safety and security of this country, and of our kith and kin? Is it £200.000,000. or is it £500,000,000? I should not be prepared to place a cash value upon the life Ur. LesUe. of a lo ed one, because, to me. the pre,r servation of that life would be worth any sacrifice. What is the cash value of Australia to Australians? I suggest that that is tbe only basis upon which we can assesswhether our expenditure upon defence isjustified. Mr Clyde Cameron interjecting, ber for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) is prepared to place a cash value upon the security of Australia, let him pay the money and we will, so to speak, build a fence behind which he can sit in safety. Most people, if they approached the problem in the way that I have suggested, would be prepared to say, "" I accept my responsibilities willingly, because 1 cannot assess the cash value of the safety of my country"". I was pleased to read the recommendation that Major-General Secombe has made on the establishment of defence outposts in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. I hope that those recommendations will be adopted by the Government. Last year, when I had tbe privilege of visiting the territory, I was struck by the remarkable difference by residents of the territory and by people in Australia. I say, with due deference to my fellow Australians, that in this country the only questions appear to be, "" How much will the Government take out of my pocket, or how much will the Government put into it? "" Although it is vitally necessary that we should undertake defence preparations, people are criticizing the Government for its expenditure upon defence. The attitude of the residents of Papua and New Guinea is that they are prepared to carry whatever burden the Government requires them to bear in the interests of defence. Many of those people experienced a war on tbeir -front doorstep, which directly affected fheir families and their properties, and they are prepared to make whatever sacrifice they are called to make to prevent a recurrence of those events. We need some of that spirit in this country. I am more than pleased that Major General Secombe bas recommended the establishment of defence outposts in the",37,Harbison Di D Not A To Supply Fighting Forces To The Limit Oi
97,Mr Leslie,"If the honourable menrTerritory of Papua and New Guinea, because tbe establishment of such outposts would ease the minds of the people there -who had such bitter experiences during the last war. I hope that the Government will not exempt certain classes of youths from liability to undergo training under the national service training scheme. believe there should be no such exemptions. If a man has a conscientious objection to service in a fighting unit, surely he cannot have a similar objection to -doing something for the country that will protect him in time of danger, and he must be prepared to serve in some capacity, even in a non-combattant unit. If he is not prepared to do so, he should get out of the country, because we do not want him here. That is straight talking. If the country is not worth fighting for, it is not worth living in. I repeat that there should be no exemptions from the national service training scheme. Deferment of training may be necessary in certain instances. In that -connection, I suggest to tbe Minister that if the training of a young man is deferred, he should be required, during the period -of deferment, to commence training with the nearest Citizen Military Forces unit. In those circumstances, he would receive -certain training and would mix with other young men in the unit. Therefore, he would not enter a national service training camp entirely unprepared. I hope that the Government is giving -serious consideration to extending the scope of the scheme to include the age group that undoubtedly would be required to bear the main burden of the fighting if this country were called upon to defend itself. We must speak of the threat to -our security, not in terms of some years hence but in terms of the immediate future. Young men of eighteen years and nineteen years will be available for -our future defence, but those between the -ages of 21 years and 26 years would be required to answer the call if it were made An the immediate future. They have no training, and I say with all due respect to -them that many of them lack a sense of 'responsibility towards this country. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. wish to support the appeal of the honourable member for Fawiaier( Mr W. M. Bourke) for a long term view of defence which, we would all agree, would eventually banish war if it were universally adopted. The abolition of war is mainly a moral problem, and we need to consider 1 whether any progress has been made during the last 50 years, and in the course of two world wars, towards an improved moral understanding of peace on the part of the people who are charged with the responsibility of the leadership of nations. We cannot explore that subject deeply, because we are more concerned with a short term approach to the subject of defence. I shall therefore refer my remarks to the short term problem. 1 consider that the Government deserves some degree of commeiid ation for having adopted a policy of restraint in relation to its announcements on defence. It cannot be suggested that it has been guilty of sabre-rattling. Tne announcements that it has made have been moderate-so moderate, in fact, that many people, including soldiers, and parents, who feel that the anxiety and burden of delay are almost unbearable are forced to clutch at straws because of the insufficiency of information that they receive from the Government about world affairs as they are related to defence. For example, the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) made only a passing reference to the fact that we were developing our armament in the hope of persuading certain people that it would not pay them to start a Avar against us. He said that he hoped that that policy would be successful. Such a policy holds the whole key to our present defence problem, and, whilst we need not indulge in sabrerattling, we should at least check our military weapons to ensure that they have not become rusty and are ready for use Ln combat. We should certainly approach the subject of defence in a non-party spirit. It is not our responsibility to approve or disapprove of the amounts of money that are requested by the defence authorities for military purposes. That is the Government's responsibility. The magnitude of these amounts is decided mainly nn the recommendations of the military",38,Harbison Di D Not A To Supply Fighting Forces To The Limit Oi

It is all related to our war-time requirements, very well to talk about the economic but the Government has provided no imbalance that has occurred in Australia proper method by which they can be since the war, but every able member should realize that a war-time requirements.

That policy should operate continuously equipment. One would be reluctant to and progressively. We should also have make observations on the subject after an improved moral outlook on the part having been out of uniform for so long, of our national leaders.

The side arms of officers and some other ranks are by no means satisfactory. Officers are equipped with ancient 44-calibre Webley pistols that go off like atomic bombs, cause clouds of smoke and light up the whole scene, including the officers who fire them, and bring all sorts of trouble should be improved as rapidly as possible. in their train. I can speak of that matter from personal experience. We should cast these weapons into tbe sea and replace them with modern weapons. The Owen gun is our most important personal weapon. I do not know whether a superior weapon is available, but I do know that tbere appears to be some degree of rigidity on tbe part of the Army administration which lays down a set scale of equipment for troops. These scales do not always meet requirements. There was an instance of one platoon of men who had with great industry passed in their rifles and were equipped completely with Owen guns on the order of one authority. They were very happy about the new weapons, but an authority caught up with them, the Owen guns were withdrawn, and the men were re-equipped with rifles. They were far happier with automatic weapons. I believe that eouinment tables should be made more flexible so that weapons suitable for the type of warfare in which men are engaged may be provided for tbem. The Army authorities are very slow in equiping Australian force? with "" bazookas "". I do not know the proper name for these weapons, but everybody knows that, they are anti-tank guns and'have been in very effective use by the armed forces of other nations for a considerable time. I wish now to say a few words about cohesion in our defence programme. Our railway gauges are not yet standardized and the transport disabilities that beset larly due to the complexity of equipment. us during the two world wars would bave to be met again in the event of another war. That is a job which the Government could press on with now. Money should not be a consideration. The only problems are labour and material. The labour required would be largely unThe standardization of our railway gauges would make our transport system much more efficient and much more able to bear tbe strain of war. Port facilities too should be improved. It is surprising indeed that Darwin has only one small wharf. Darwin is most important to our defence, and shipping facilities there Other honourable members have stressed the need for improved wharfs in the capital cities. That too is a job that could be tackled now, when men are being thrown out of employment by the decline in shipping trade and when ample unskilled labour is available. The national service training scheme sliould commend itself to everybody. 1 believe that trainees could be given six months' training with advantage to themselves and to the community as a whole: but apparently that is not possible. The three months that they clo spend in camp is well spent. I have no adverse comments to offer on that scheme. Indeed, I congratulate the Minister for the Army upon it. The Citizen Military Forces, of course, a most important adjunct to our defence and, in any future war, would play as important a part as it played in World War II . when the backbone of the Australian Imperial Forces came from the militia forces. The Government might well consider establishing a counterpart of the Citizen Military Forces for women who are called upon to play an increasingly important part in defence establishments in war-time. I see no reason why women should not be organized now. the strength of 6,000 already. be made to anticipate difficulties that are bound to arise in time of war, particuIn examining some of the establishments of the Royal Australian Air Force, I",39,Harbison Di D Not A To Supply Fighting Forces To The Limit Oi

100,,"Mr JOSHUA -Every effort should have observed that it takes several years to train a mechanic to repair and maintain equipment. There again women could play a valuable role, because much of the work is light and requires only an intelligent mind. Many women are admirably suited to this type of work, and I sbould like to see their services being utilized. Our medical services, too, should be examined. To train a doctor takes years. In time of war there is a. great demand for doctors because so many of them enlist in the armed forces. There too, I believe women could play an important part. Some encouragement should be given to women to enter the medical profession. No doubt many of them would marry soon after graduating, but they generally maintain their interest in medical work, and they could form a valuable reservoir of professional skill which would be available in time of war. In our organization of industry certain measures are open to us which, unfortunately, appear to be repugnant to the Government. I urge honourable members opposite not to be too squeamish about using them, because, if war comes, they will have to be used wholesale. I refer, for instance, to prices control and the subsidizing of certain industries which must be encouraged. The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. listened with great interest to the temperate and impartial speech of the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr make on the situation is that the Joshua). It is pleasing that the debate to-day has shown little of the party strife which so often characterizes proceedings in this Parliament. It is encouraging to. find that, in time of national anxiety and peril, honourable members are able to lift themselves above party quarrels at least for a while. I wish to speak particularly of the Royal Australian Navy. Unfortunately the Defence Estimates show no division of funds between rhe three services, but, on the basis of last year's expenditure of approximately £3S,000,000 on the Navy, the figure this year will be approximately £45,000,000. T certainly hope that it will not be less rhan that, because I doubt whether adequate naval defence can be provided or maintained for even £45,000,000. The budget gives no indication of how the vote for the Navy will be expended and it is difficult to estimatehow it will be expended because we have not been given a comprehensive review of the state of the Navy since April, 1951.. However, from the information disclosed, in that review, and from general knowledge, we can form some idea of this year'sallocation. We shall have two aircraftcarriers of the light fleet type. One, HMAS. Sydney, is already in service,, and the other will shortly be handed over to the Navy by the builders. Therewillbe three cruisers. One of them,. HMAS. Australia, is in commission,, another, HMAS. Shropshire, is inreserve, and the third, HMAS. Eoiovrt, is on its way to Newcastle for a refit: Then there appear to be about fifteendestroyers, of wbich about five are incommission, about five are being refitted or converted into fast anti-submarine vessels, one or two are in reserve-, and two are building. a dozen frigates of World War II . vintage. They are slow ships suitablefor escorting slow convoys, or for useaga.inst the slow submarines of the last war. In addition, tbere is a largenumber of mine-sweepers, some survey ships, boom defence vessels and otherauxiliary vessels of all kinds. The first comment that I wish toNavy is not yet ready for war. Therough survey of ships that I have madeshows that of a fleet which, even on. paper, is too small for our security, at least half of the vessels are undergoinglong refit or conversion, or are .in a state of reserve from which they cannot be brought into active service at shortnotice. I am not criticizing the MinisterBoard or the service itself for this state of affairs. The very small post-war naval' votes reduced the Royal Australian Navy to a strength that was inadequate for our immediate security and, with our limited resources in dockyards and"" personnel, a state of unreadiness was, I",41,Harbison Di D Not A To Supply Fighting Forces To The Limit Oi

104,"For The Navy ( Mr Mcmahon), The Naval'","am afraid, inevitable. However, my point is that the nation should not delude itself into thinking that it has a naval force adequate for the immediate defence of this continent, or for making a due contribution to the defence of the free world. If we are to have security for our coasts, our commerce and the passage of our troops in war, we must pay for it, not only in war-time, because we cannot develop a navy overnight, but also in the years of peace that precede war. Vear by year in peace-time our Navy must be steadily developed and maintained. For that reason, I believe that, in a. perilous world, an appropriation of £4.5,000,000 for naval services is not enough. The next question that we should ask ourselves is whether the money appropriated for the Navy is being wisely expended. Is the present and planned fleet of two carriers, two cruisers, fifteen or seventeen destroyers -whe n they are completed-and a dozen old frigates, the most balanced and useful fleet for our needs that we can obtain for the money available? In order to form a judgment on that question we must anticipate the role of our Navy in the war which appears to be so dangerously near. The threat comes from Russia and the Communist bloca closely integrated continental moss in Eastern Europe and Asia. In that respect the position of the free nations will be akin to their position in the last war when they fought the forces of fascism, but there will be very important difFerences. Luring the next war there will be no enemy battle fleets to threaten us. There will probably be very few enemy armed merchant cruisers because the Russians have few fast merchant vessels. They are not a seafaring people as are the Germans and the Italians and consequently, it is likely that the threat from armed merchant raiders will not be so great as it was during the last war. But tbe submarine threat will be infinitely greater. It is common knowledge that before the end of the last war tbe Germans had developed fast and effective submarines of radically new design, the secrets of which are in the hands of the Communists. Long-range aircraft at sea will constitute a far greater menace than during the last Avar. The development of atomic weapons may not very greatly affect warfare at sea, but with their capacity to wreck ports and dockyards, they will compel the diversion of ships and forces, which, in turn, will greatly increase the importance of repair ships, store ships and auxiliaries. In future the Navy will have to be more mobile than it has been in the past. As I have said on other occasions, we 3hall stand or fall with the free nations, and our contribution to tbe cause of the free nations, in food, troops or arms, will have to be made at a great distance from our shores. As in past wars, it will be the Navy's principal job to keep the sea routes open and to ensure the .safety of our convoys. Let us examine the Navy which we plan in the light of these circumstances. The two fleet carriers are absolutely essential. There has been much controversy about tlie future of carriers in modern warfare in view of the development of long-range aircraft. I do not want to go into that matter now. I merely point out that in the defence of convoys at sea. especially against submarines, and in offensive operations searching for and destroying submarines at sea, there is no effective substitute for aircraft on the spot under the command of the officer in charge of the escort or searching force. Carrier-based aircraft arcspecialized aircraft, specially fitted, slow, ancl unsuitable for land warfare. They are manned by specially trained crews and perform a function which cannot be effectively discharged by the large, fast, powerful, long-range aircraft based ashore. That is the special and limited function of the aircraft of the light fleet carriers of the Royal Australian Navy, and the carriers are a vital and necessary part of the fleet. More than two carriers are essential to our defence. Let us now turn to the three cruisers. I believe that they are an unnecessary encumbrance and expense, and that they should be scrapped. For the reasons I have stated, there is little or no place for heavy ships-battleship s or cruisersin the war that I envisage. Our two ""'County"" class cruisers, HMAS. Auslralia and HMAS. Shropshire, are out of date. One of them is certainly worn out and should be disposed of. The conversion of HMAS. Hobart should be stopped forthwith. We cannot provide ourselves with enough small, fast anti-submarine vessels and we should not expend our limited resources on these oid cruisers. It may be argued that a cruiser in commission is needed for training, but in a navy, the first-line vessels of which should be carriers and fast anti-submarine vessels, the personnel can best be trained in small ships and in the carriers. On the personnel side, the situation is, The honourable member's time has expired. I believe, a. good deal better.

107,For The Navy ( Mr Mcmahon). I Agree Sydney.,"a vessel sbould be based on Cairns for tbe purpose of patrolling tbe Barrier Reef area. A patrol vessel similar to the old Larrakia should be based on Darwin. Perhaps the Government could bring out of reserve a corvette or a frigate to perform that work. Patrol vessels would be of great use in our northern waters, because they would be on the spot and able to investigate immediately the activities of any strange vessels, or any unusual occurrence, off our northern coast. The Minister for the Navy should give serious consideration to stationing at least three patrol vessels in our far north. I suggest that they could be based at Darwin, Cairns and Manus Island, which are the three points of our northern defence triangle. The iron at Yampi Sound, the uranium at Eum Jungle and other places in the Northern Territory and the minerals to be found in the Mount Isa area, are all very important in our defence system. Therefore, they should be carefully protected. Their adequate protection is another reason why anything suspicious that occurs off our northern coasts should be promptly investigated. That is further evidence of the necessity for patrol vessels to be stationed nearby. At present a search for oil is being made in the north of Western Australia. If oil should be discovered there, the need would become all the more imperative for the adequate patrolling of our northern waters. I again remind honourable members that many of our most important raw materials are to be found in the most exposed parts of the Commonwealth, and r suggest that we should take immediate steps to protect those assets. The most practicable immediate step that could be taken would be to provide one or more patrol vessels in the north. Of course I do not Such a rail link is necessary, not only for believe that any patrol vessel would be able defence, but also to develop the Northern to protect the area, but it would at least he able to investigate reports of any strange craft that might be sighted about our coasts. Such activity would be as useful as the work before 1939 of Larrakia at Darwin and Vigilant off the eastern coast of Queensland in reporting the landings of the crews of Japanese sampans on our beaches and on islands close to our shores. I make my suggestion in all seriousness, because in the far Ur. Riordan. north no defence works of any consequence are being undertaken at present, except at Manus Island, and our defence activity there is very small. Of course, an aerodrome has recently been built at Mount Isa, and that has some defence value, but apart from that there are no works of a true defence nature at present going on in our far north. I shall now deal with the matter of railway communication. Two days ago the Acting Premier of Queensland, Mr Duggan, announced that the Queensland Government had called for a report about the value of a railway link between Dajarra, in western Queensland, and Camooweal. The distance is about 12S miles, and the proposed railway has been estimated to cost about £6,000,000. It is approximately 4S7 miles from Camooweal to Birdum, and a rail link between those two towns would cost about £15,000,000. I suggest that such railways are necessary from a defence viewpoint, because any future threat to Australia must come from the north. In the event of war. it will be necessary to supply the north from the southern parts of the continent. As the honourable member for Evans and the Minister for the Navy have said, the most dangerous threat to our shores in a future war would be made by hostile submarines. No naval weapon has been undergoing more rapid development both inside the organization of the United Nations and outside it, as has the submarine. I have shown that in a future war it will be necessary to supply the north from the south. If war occurred and submarines should be harrying our coastal shipping, our defence material would have to be carried by railways. In those circumstances it is essential that Darwin should be linked with northern Queensland by a railway system. Territory and so increase our production of food. It would prove of great value in saving the thousands of head of stock that are periodically lost because of droughts in the Northern Territory. I suggest that the Government should give very serious consideration to allocating about £21,000,000 for the construction of the Carnooweal-Dajarra railway and a railway from Camooweal to Birdum. When; H r . Forgan Smith was Premier of Queensland his Government offered to build a railway to Camooweal if the Australian Government would complete the link from Camooweal to Birdum. His suggestion was rejected by the then United Australia party Government which beid office in the Commonwealth. In the light of our experience in the last great war, and in view of the knowledge that we have about the possibility of a future attack on Australia, urgent consideration should be given by the Government to the linking up of Birdum to the railway system in Queensland. I certainly suggest that if the Minister for Commerce and Agriin this proposal, then the Minister for the Navy certainly should be. I now turn to a consideration of the nature of the aircraft that might be used on hostile aircraft carriers. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN member's time has expired. the Navy and Minister for Air) [3.34] I desire to deal with two arguments used by the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan). The first related to Manus Island. About this matter I express grievous doubts whether the honourable member knows what he is talking about. ""When this Government assumed office it found that the preceding. Labour Government had permitted the Manus Island defences to fall into such a state of disrepair that they could not. be used. A great naval asset had been rendered practically derelict because the then Labour Government, which included the honorabie member for Kennedy, did not accept its responsibilities and maintain that naval base in the> state of preparedness in which it had been, left by the Americans. It is sheer nonsense for the honourable member to say that this Government has failed in its responsibilities towards Australia's defence, I think that honourable members on this, side of the House who follow me in this debate will make it quite clear that Manus Island is at present a forward operational naval base and can be used by either the. American or the Australian 1 [32 1 Fleet. This comes ill from a member of the Opposition who, when he was a member of the Labour Government, allowed the establishment at Manus Island to become derelict. Recently, the Government has improved matters on the island, and a service unit will be placed there to accelerate development. The honourable member alleged that on the 5th or 6th May-h e did not say im which year, but we are to assume that it was 1950a submarine was sighted off Finschafen. An examination of the -report indicates how readily honourable members of the Opposition can fall into error. According to the report, an ex-naval officer stated that during the hours of daylight he had heard a submarine. Hti did nof say that he had seen one. It woiildbe difficult for anyone to identify a sound as that of a submarine. It is true that the same officer stated that later, during the night, he had seen the periscope or some portion of a submarine, but let it not be forgotten that this alleged sighting took place at night. identify it as a submarine by its shape. able member go up to New Guinea, and if he can find a submarine there he can have it. He can then bring it back, and sink it off the Maroubra beach. at Maroubra? wreck removed for the honourable member, but the job proved to be beyond our capacity. For the attempt I expected gratitude, not criticism. We have increased our naval strength in New Guinea waters, and' we intend to send another Fairmile launch to that area. We in Australia are not without friends, and in the event «rf trouble, we should not have to contend with a powerful fleet or a strong mercantile marine such as the Japanese poioessed at the outbreak of the last war. There is. no great naval threat to Australia at the present time. The greatest danger, should war come, would be from submarines, not from vast fleets, either naval or mercantile.

From the financial provision that is made for this year we are justified in expecting better results. I should like to be given information about the factories among which the Minister has distributed orders. In my electorate, there are a number of hugo radio industries which have rendered excellent service to the defence forces in the past. Some of these industries formerly employed 300 or 400 men on the assemb y lines, but to-day only about 30 men are engaged. factories to obtain defence orders of any kind. One factory, which had a turnover of £750,000 a year and employed skilled, personnel to fulfil defence orders, has received only one order to a value of £4.000 or £5,000. I shall be interested to learn how the Department of Defence Production, makes allocations, where the orders are placed, and whether the Government has made a reasonable attempt, since the closing down of various industries, to increase the volume of defence orders in order to absorb men who have been dismissed from so-called non-essential industries. The Department of Defence Production is supposed, to be establishing reserves the Minister for Supply( Mr Beale) of munitions for use in an emergency and absorbing employees from non-essential industries. A few days ago, I asked the Minister acting for the Minister for Labour and National Service vacancies for employment existed in New South Wales. tbo answer that was given to me, there are no vacancies for 'workers in factories engaged on defence contracts in that State. Jobs are available in the primary producing, mining and quarrying, manufacturing, building and construction, and transport industries; commerce, finance, and communications; -and in public administration, health, education and a few other services. As the large amount of £200,000,000 has been provided for defence purposes during' the current financial year, a 1 specialized section should be established in the Commonwealth Employment Service to provide information about vacancies in factories engaged in various forms of defence production. Despite tbe financial provision made for the Department of Defence Production and tbe big staff employed in that branch of the Public Service, not one vacancy in any factory engaged on defence work appears in the information supplied to me. A couple of years ago, the Government announced its intention to stock-pile certain goods for defence purposes. Later, it was found that some of those goods were unobtainable, or perhaps the GoI t is impossible for those vernment did not try to get them. Whatever the reason might have been, tbe Government soft-pedalled on its stockpiling policy, and is not now proceeding with it. Consequently, tbe Department of Defence Production is a top-heavy administrative organization, which plays an ineffective part in securing necessary supplies for defence purposes. Before the Government launched its attack against the so-called non-essential industries, it should have taken the precaution to ensure that sufficient defence contracts would be available to enable other factories to absorb the persons who would lose their employment. Unfortunately, the Minister for Defence Production and failed to take that elementary precaution. Industries, which were classified as non-essential, were forced to close by vicious impositions of sales tax. Many of those factories could have played an important part in fulfilling defence orders, but tbey were closed According to almost overnight by this' Government, which boasts of its policy of encouraging private enterprise, and lectures us on the value of private enterprise and on the need to preserve competition in industry. However, private enterprise was viciously attacked by the present Administration, and many workers were paid off, and had to seek other employment. The Government should have anticipated that situation by allocating substantial defence orders to industries, and thereby providing employment for the displaced workers. Yet factories in my electorate, capable of fulfilling defence contracts, are not working to capacity, ' because orders have . not been lodged by tbe Department of Defence",48,Harbison Di D Not A To Supply Fighting Forces To The Limit Oi

To place such, organizations under private enterprise is to increase their efficiency, and, consequently, to enhance their value for defence purposes. I .desire to devote the time available to into their laps. If they lost it, they uie to a consideration of the estimates for the Royal Australian Air Force. The amount provided this year is approximately £7,000,000 greater than that provided last year. That is to be expected because the Royal Australian Air Force, in common with the other services, is in the middle of a rapidly expanding programme. I do not consider that it is necessary for me to attempt to defend the Government's defence policy either in this chamber or to the people of Australia, tn the present world conditions and with international relationships strained as they are, we are justified in making the greatest possible effort within our resources to defend tbe country. Indeed, it is our duty to do so. There is, however, some room for debate as to the best means that we sbould employ. Australia has not only the responsibility to guard itself but also the responsibility to play a just part in the defence of the British Empire and the western democratic world. I do not contend that ground and sea forces will not play a vital and prominent part in any future conflict that may occur, but I do suggest that having regard to Australia's geographic, economic and strategic situation, the greatest emphasis should be placed on air power. Australia is an island continent somewhat' off the normal strategic line of communications and our national resources are limited, compared with those that are available to the major world powers which would inevitably be involved in any big conflict. We liave no land frontiers except the minorone in New Guinea. It is true that Australia is not self-sufficient and that we will be dependent to a large degree on open sea communications. The Navy has a vital role in that sphere. One recent event has enhanced the land frontier and at that stage effecstrategic enormously. That is the discovery of Thoughts along those lines give a new uranium in the Northern Territory. It significance to the national service trainhas also greatly increased the threat of ing scheme. attack and invasion. In the past our enemies have regarded Australia as of relatively little strategic importance during the actual conduct of a war. If they won the war, Australia would fall could not hold Australia even if they had captured it during hostilities. But with the discovery of uranium, the situation has changed. We have now a big responsibility not only to ourselves but to the Empire and to our allies during the progress of a war. We must re-orient defence policy. I suggest that if we analyse the probable plan that a potential enemy would consider, we will find that such a plan would seek first to deny our uranium to us and our allies. In the second place, our enemies would seek to obtain that uranium for their own use. Therefore, we can reasonably expect that one of the first hostile acts of an enemy would be a heavy air attack on the uranium mines with the object of denying our resources of uranium to us partially or completely. Clearly the counter to such a move by the enemy is a sufficiently powerful air force to defend our uranium. Such a defence would call for an air force very much stronger than the Royal Australian Air Force is at its present stage of development. In addition to adequate day and night fighter squadrons we would need all the ancillary equipment and services that enable an air force to fight. They would include both land and air-borne radar communications, reserves of air crew, aircraft, ammunition, fuel supplies and a hundred and one other auxiliary organizations and equipment without which an air force cannot function. Never before has Australia presented such an attractive target, and there can be no question that it will attract an attack in the event of a war. The second step that a potential enemy is likely to plan is to obtain our uranium for his own use. That involves the occupation by the enemy of a part or all of this country. If that should occur, we would be faced immediately with a importance of Australia tive ground forces would be essential. However, I believe that tbe most economic defence and our most effective defence against invasion lies in air power. Any attacking forces can reacb this island continent only by ships or aircraft, and no armed forces are more vulnerable than those which are concentrated in ships Or aircraft before they can land and deploy for battle. clear that our most effective method of defending ourselves within our resources -and I emphasize that point-is by air power. Certainly an invasion on a full scale would have to be staged by an army landing from ships. But whether the enemy forces come by ships or by aircraft, air power will provide our most effective defence. Enemy forces might be landed by aircraft for a partial occupation. That is perhaps a reasonable proposition because one can imagine quite readily that if our uranium resources are as valuable as we believe them to be, an enemy would consider worthwhile a considerable effort to occupy the north-west corner of Australia embracing the uranium fields at Rum Jungle and the port of Darwin. An enemy which was successful in such a move could then produce uranium for its own use and ship it to its own manufacturing centres. I know that many critics deny that air power alone can be an effective weapon of defence, but I submit that innumerable historical' incidents have proved that air power, in fact, can be effective. We celebrate in Australia eacii year the anniversary of tbe Battle of the Coral Sea. By tradition, most people think that it was a naval battle, but it was a naval battle only in the sense that it was fought at sea. In fact, it was an air battle. The surface ships did not come within sight of each other. They were not within range, and shots were not exchanged. The result of the battle was determined by air power, and it is clear that thc action removed the danger of a Japanese invasion of Australia. Even prior to the Battle of the Coral Sea, air power played a large part in defeating Japan's invasion plans. The enemy had establisbed its invasion launching base at Rabaul, and constant air bombardment of the accumulation of ships and supplies there delayed the attempt to invade Australia sufficiently to enable the ilr. Bostock. allies to concentrate the carrier force that was finally successful in the Coral Sea. Another example of the effectiveness of air power was provided in Malaya. Malaya was invaded because we did not have the necessary air power in that theatre. The character of the war in Malaya was changed overnight when Therefore, it is Japanese aircraft sank two of our capital ships, Prince of Wales and Repulse. As a result of that action, Japan gained complete supremacy at sea and was able at will to pour its forces into Malaya. Such a situation could not have developed if our Command had had at it3 disposal the air power necessary to defend Malaya. There can be no tenable argument, in my view, against the need to provide Australia with means of defence in the present uneasy and difficult times. We are a young nation with very limited resources of man-power and potential war supplies. We should be foolish if we did not analyse tbe situation very carefully, and I believe that every one who does so must inevitably come to the conclusion that the surest means of defence that is conceivably within our resources is the development of the Royal Australian Air Force. [4.7] I am glad lo have the opportunity to support the opinions of the honourable member for Indi( Mr Bostock) on the subject of the proper defence of Australia.

126,Mr Drakeford,"We could imProduction and the Department of Defence. As the honourable member for Indi has said, there should be a careful analysis of the position and the Estimates should be presented in such a way that honourable members will be able to see how much money is to be expended by the respective departments. Although the Estimates are presented in some detail, in my opinion it would be much better if more detail were given. It may perhaps be said that that course was not followed by the previous Labour Government. That is true, but if the position could be remedied I have no doubt that honourable members would be better able to express their opinions. This Government, which intends to get rid of the most valuable assets we possess, proposes to devote £200,000,000, to defence purposes in the current financial year. I venture to offer the criticism that it is pursuing an entirely wrong policy. An anti-Labour Government was dismissed from office in 1941 because the electors considered that it was not making a real war effort. The real war effort was made by the Labour Government which succeeded it. ""When we came to office, irail transport was in such a state that if we wanted to shift a division of troops from Western Australia to Adelaide or Melbourne it took a month or six weeks to do so. We should devote more attention to our railways and endeavour to make our shipping facilities better than they are. The ship-building industry was encouraged by the Labour Government but is not being fostered by the present Government which apparently is thinking of selling our assets. In discussing the proposed sale of the Commonwealth line of ships, the Melbourne Age, in its leading article on the 4th December last, saidI t is of the utmost importance that, whether say "" Hear, hear! "" The people of Austhe ships be sold or retained, onr ship-building tralia recognize that Labour carried on industry, its installations, skilled craftsmen, the defence of the country in such a way technicians and all the things that are essenthat it was saved from capture by the tial to fulfilment of its role, should be conenemy. The supporters of the Governtinued as a going concern under control of the National Government, as now, and rement are not tbe only people who know garded as an indispensable part. of the anything about the defence of the country. country's provision for defence. The article continued:The paramount factor is that industry is one of the essentials of defence and national defence. The shipping industry is one survival. Mr Drakeford. That should be obvious to everybody. Yet this Government, which believes that £200,000,000, should be devoted to defence expenditure this year, proposes to sell assets which Australia will have to buy back again at some future time. How does it know that the combine which will take over the Commonwealth line of ships will not sell them to a potential enemy? There is no guarantee that that will not happen. The Opposition is not so much alarmed at tbe proposal to sell the ships as at what may happen as the result of the sale. The sale of the Government shares in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited has not been forgotten. The honourable member for Indi has referred to the part which radar plays in modern warfare. I appreciate the force of that statement because I know.that the expenditure of the Department of Air has been increasing steadily on account of the necessity to provide for the use of radar. Yet the Government has sold our interest in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited at a time when electronics is playing a far greater part in defence than at any other time in our history. It will play an even greater part in the future. The proposed disposal of Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited has been referred to by the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) and other honourable members. My only comment on that matter is that if the Government disposes of that organization it will commit a crime against the people of Australia. Unfortunately those who support this Government speak as if they are the only ones who are able to deal with such matters. some honourable member opposite would In my opinion the disposal of instrumentalities such as the Commonwealth line of ships is detrimental to national of our lines of defence, as is the aircraft",53,Harbison Di D Not A To Supply Fighting Forces To The Limit Oi

We must devote our attention to training men so that if a war comesand we know that we shall not be able to defend our country alone but will have to rely on our allies-w e shall be able to produce sufficient food to supply the allied troops who come to this country. We must ensure that there will be sufficient skilled men here to maintain the various, shipping and aircraft services. If we fail t.o do so we shall be letting down the people of Australia. It is likely that if bers opposite. It is comforting to know war breaks out again we shall be struck so suddenly that we may be left without a defence potential. I cannot support for one moment the policy of the Government in devoting so much of the proposed defence expenditure of £200,000,000 to the army side. In my opinion the expenditure on the army should be reduced considerably. is putting forward his individual opinion against that of the chiefs of staff. that the Minister for the Army( Mr said that his Government would not Francis) thinks that such a reduction might affect his importance. I appreciate, of course, that the honourable gentleman migbt not like such a course to be adopted. However, I have not indulged in an attack upon the Army has made a personal attack instead. done that. I believe in self-defence as well as in defence estimates. In my opiuion defence expenditure is not being apportioned in a way that will be of tbe greatest benefit to Australia. In saying so, I speak from some experience during a period of war, and I know that that, is the view of persons who have devoted thought, to the subject. The honourable member for Indi has pointed out that our economic situation has been changed by the discovery of uranium in the Northern Territory and that, as a consequence of that discovery, the Northern Territory is more likely to be made the target of an enemy attack. He suggested that we could defend it more readily if we had a line of aircraft available to repel a possible attack. He pointed out the lesson of the Coral Sea and referred to the effect on the campaign in Malaya during World War II . when two or the most important vessels of the British fleet were lost because of inadequate protection from the air. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEM AN Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired. [4.23] I have listened with great -interest to the speeches of honourable memthat at least some of them appreciate the dangers which face this country and are prepared to admit that we should be in a position to defend ourselves. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) stated that the Labour Government was able to defend this country and to save it from being captured by the enemy. I remind him that that was possible only be; cause the foundations of the defence measures had been laid by the previous Government. The late Mr Curtin paid a tribute to that Government when he have been able to carry on the defence work if it had not been for the foundations which had been laid so solidly. I wish to devote my remarks mainly to our defences in the north of Australia and the islands adjacent to the north. Eecently, I had the opportunity to visit Manus Island, upon which attention has again been focused as a result of the ANZUS conference that was held at Honolulu. Manus Island is of vital importance to the defence of Australia. Only when one visits the island, does one realize fully the tragedy of the action of the Chifley Government in kicking out the Americans who were prepared to remain at Manus Island and develop it as a defence base. The island is situated about 240 miles to the north-east of New Guinea. It has one of the finest harbours, with natural defences, in the Pacific. I am pleased that the Government has commenced the task of re-establishing Manus Island as a modern naval and air base. However, that task should not be solely the responsibility of Australia. I agree with the honourable member forKennedy( Mr Eiordan) that this country does not possess adequate financial resources for that purpose.

In this literally choked the roads leading to the respect, I commend the Minister for the is ideal for the construction of nofc only a naval base but also an air base. Reefs provide natural .defences for the harbour against naval attack, and the island's physical features provide natural defences against attack from the air. It is clear that in any future war, we shall be obliged the north. Therefore, the Government to throw open that base for use by our allies. As our natural ally in the Pacific is the United States of America, the Government should immediately open negotiations with the American Government with a view to enlisting its help in the maintenance and development of that base.

135,Mr Bird (Batman) [4.33],"Thesaddle in that country. The Government's view, of course, is that the Pacific military preparedness. security pact cancels out any dangers that may flow from its action in signing the Japanese Peace Treaty. However, I have not much faith in the Pacific security pact, because any of the signatories may withdraw from it merely by giving twelve months' notice of its intenrailways and roads. Our industrial tion to do so. Consequently, having regard to the vagaries of international events, we of efficiency that existed during the last may not escape the dangers that are inherent in the Japanese peace treaty and about which the Opposition warned the Government. In these circumstances, the Parliament must do everything in its power to enable Australia to defend itself effectively. Members of the Labour party recognize that the first responsibility of any government, regardless of party, is the maintenance of the sovereignty of Australia. As to how that sovereignty can be maintained there is an honest difference of opinion between the opposing parties in this chamber. We are all agreed that the first duty of any government in relation to defence is to give secure and inspiring leadership to the people, and in turn, the people must share a deep and united belief in the necessity for the government's preparations for defence. The defence programme upon which we have embarked required an expenditure of £169,4'94,719 during the last financial year and it is expected that £200,000,000 will be expended under this heading during the current financial year. This expenditure will impose social stresses on, and sacrifices by the people. However, the people will be prepared to bear these burdens cheerfully if the Government takes adequate steps to protect the things that they value most in life. We should utilize every possible opportunity to culadequate stock-pile of those raw materials. tivate friendly relations with the Asian nations. We on this side of the chamber believe that our security denends to a considerable degree upon the elimination of the colour factor. We must convince the Asian peoples that we do not despise them because of tbeir colour. Unless we assail this formidable task cheerfully and optimistically we shall only be espousing a lost cause. All honourable members agree, I think, that onr defence policy should embrace all aspects of industrial, naval, aerial and Primary production must be increased, so that Australia will be able to assume the role of a supplier of food in any future war. The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Brimblecombe) has already referred to the necessity to develop our strategic potential must be restored to the degree war,' and not allowed to languish in the future. Under the economic strain of the last few months the efficiency of some of our industries has tended to deteriorate. I shall now make a few observations about stock-piling for defence, which is a very important aspect of defence preparedness. Australia is not the only nation that is faced with the necessity to stock-pile. Should we become involved in another war, we may experience even greater difficulty in obtaining raw materials than existed during the last war. It will be remembered that Great Britain declared war on Germany on the 3rd September, 1939. It was not until the 7th December, 1941, however, that hostilities were extended to the Pacific area, by Japan's attack on Pearl Harbour. Consequently, we had an opportunity, during the intervening period of an uneasy peace with Japan, to import defence materials. In the future we may not have such an opportunity. We obtain large quantities of raw materials vital to the prosecution of war from the Far East. As it is likely that that area will be the seat of hostilities in any future world conflict, we may find ourselves in "" queer street"" unless we have accumulated an Our neighbours of the Far East are the logical peace-time suppliers of certain commodities to this eountry. We could not hope for a continuance of the present importing arrangements if a state of war were to develop in the Pacific. By far the greatest proportion of natural rubber comes from the Far East.. In 1949, Malaya produced 47 per cent, of the world's output of this commodity; Indonesia. 29 per cent.: Thailand. 6 per cent.: Ceylon, 6 per cent.; and Borneo, 4 per cent. Only8 per cent, of the world's output conies from other regions, principally the Latin American States. During 1949-50 Australia imported 92 per cent, of its requirements of natural rubber from Malaya; 4 per cent, from the Territory of Papua and New Guinea; and 2 per cent, from Ceylon. If we were cut off from Malaya during any future conflict it would be very difficult for us to obtain our requirements of raw rubber. That was our experience during World War II . In 1941-42 we imported 370,000 cwt. of raw rubber from Malaya compared witb only 145,000 cwt. in 1944-45. In the intervening period we imported supplies from Ceylon, India, and the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, where output had been' suddenly boosted. If , during any future global war we were unable to import raw rubber from those countries our war effort would be hampered. Tin is another commodity that is vital to the prosecution of a war. To-day we import only a relatively small quantity of tin from the Far Eastern countries, because we have not yet developed the tinplate industry of this country to any appreciable degree. Ausuralia is. the world's fourth largest consumer of tinplate, most of which is imported from the United States of America and the United Kingdom. With the completion of the tinplate mill at Port Kembla that is now under construction, it will be necessary for us to import large quantities of tinplate ore. To-day Malaya and Indonesia produce 56 per cent, of the world output of tin concentrate. Thailand, China, and Burma together produce about 5 per cent, of the world's output. Bolivia and the Belgian Congo also produce tin concentrate. If , during any future war, we were cut' off from the Far Eastern sources of supply of tin concentrate, our tinplate industry would suffer. Therefore it is vitally important that we should stock-pile tin concentrate. I come now to oil, which is a very important commodity in the prosecution of a war. As honourable members are aware, the closing of the Abadan refinery reduced the availability of oil to Australia. Previously we had obtained from 25 per cent, to 33£ per cent of our requirements of oil from Iran. After the Mr Bird. war, and up to the time that the Abadan refinery closed, our iniports from Iran increased steadily. Whereas in 1947 we imported about 790,000,000 gallons of oil from Iran, bur imports rose to 1,309,000,000 gallons in 1950. Since the Abadan refinery closed we have imported large quantities of oil from the Far East. We must realize that this source of supply would not be available to us should another war occur in. the Pacific area. A successful outcome of the present negotiations in relation to the Abadan refinery does not appear likely. Before the last war about two-thirds of Australia's requirements of oil were obtained from the Netherlands East Indies. The remaining one-third was obtained in approximately equal quantities from Iran, Bahrein, and the United States of America. We still obtain about two-thirds of our requirements of oil from the Far East. As this source of supply would be cut off from us during any future global war, we should consider alternative sources of supply. During the last war we obtained. 60 per cent, of our requirements of oil from the United States of America, and the remaining 40 per cent, from Iran and Bahrein. In the event of our becoming involved in another war the maintenance of supplies of oil to this country would present a very serious problem, to the Government. Therefore, the oil refining facilities that are at present under construction in Australia are very important from a defence point of view. The plant at present in use in this country is capable of refining about 15 per cent, of our requirements of oil. I am sure that all honourable members are pleased that additional oil refineries aTe to be established in Australia. The plant that is under construction in Geelong by the Shell Company of Australia Limited will make an important contribution to our oil refining capacity. In any event, a lot of hard thinking must be done about oil imports and the stock-piling of oil for use in the event of war. Phosphates are important both in war and in peace, because they are vital to primary production. Sixty per cent, of our phosphate rock comes from the Pacific area, mainly from Nauru, and 15 per cent, from Christmas Island, in the Indian Ocean. The remainder comes ironi North Africa, but it is of such a low grade that it is not of much use. If, in. the event of war, nearby sources of supply were lost, we should be dependent upon supplies from Egypt, Morocco and Algeria, but, as I have said, the phosphate rock from those countries is of an exceptionally low grade and is not of much use in primary production. I hope that the Government is giving serious consideration to the problem of stock-piling sulphur, another important commodity. We must have sulphur for phosphatic fertilizers, and it is required in large quantities also for industrial purposes. It was stated recently that industrial sulphur consumption is the index of a nation's industrial development. Sulphur can be produced from sulphide minerals such as .zinc and lead concentrates, from pyrites, and from elemental rock salts. We produce zinc concentrates in this country and, from them, we derive about a half of our sulphur requirements. stances, we must import substantial quantities of elemental sulphur from tlie United States of America and from Italy, but, unfortunately, world supplies of sulphur are limited. That presents us with a very thorny problem, because if the United States of America or Italy became involved in a war we should be struggling for sulphur. I hope that the Minister for Supply( Mr Beale) is giving earnest consideration to this problem. Numerous other commodities that are necessary to implement a war effort must be imported and stock-piled. We get antimony from Thailand, copper and bar iron from Ja.'pan, manganese from India and New Caledonia, and chromium from New Caledonia. Supplies can be obtained also from other countries and from domestic production. The DEPUTY CHAIBMAN ( Mr agree that the scheme has been successBowden) -Order! The honourable memful and has been accepted by the people ber's time has expired.' The debate this afternoon has been very the Royal Australian Air Force Reserve. interesting, because honourable members. I am seriously concerned about the drift on both sides of the chamber have made of that reserve and, I regret to say, its an objective approach to the problem of inaction. Just after the end of the last defence. A notable sneech from the war, the Minister for Air, who was then Opposition side of the chamber was that the honourable member for Maribyrnong made by the honourable member for ( Mr Drakeford), establisbed the Royal Ballarat( Mr Joshua). Unfortunately, there is still a repetition by some members of the Opposition of the false legend that between 1939 and 1941, the present Government parties, which were then in office, let the country down. A striking answer to that allegation is to be found in words that were uttered by the late Mr Curtin, when he was Prime Minister of this country. On the 12th October. 1941, he saidI have to pay tribute to the Government that preceded my own for tlie constructive work they have done in defence and the foundations thcy had laid. On the IS t h October, 1941, MrC u r t in saidThe JTavy was at its highest pitch of efficiency, as demonstrated by the notable exploit* of our sliips overseas. The home defence army was well trained, and its equipment had been greatly improved. The strength of the A i r Force had been largely increased, both in respect of home defence squadrons and the training resources of the Empire air scheme. Under present circumThe equipment of the A i r Force has also been much improved. Finally, munitions production and the development of productive capacity over a wide range of classes, including aircraft, was growing weekly. Those words constitute a complete answer to the false legend which some members of the Opposition attempt to establish that the present Government parties did nothing about defence when they were in office previously. It is not proper to accuse this Government of failure to make adequate provision for the defence of Australia. Surely one of the most brilliant successes, politically speaking, that this country has seen for a long time is the national service training scheme. I believe that the members of the Opposition who voted against the measure under which the scheme was established must, if they are honest, admit now that the measure was justified, and on the whole. I want to make some comments about",56,Harbison Di D Not A To Supply Fighting Forces To The Limit Oi
136,Mr Falkinder (Franklin) [4.48],"Australian Air Eorce General Reserve. All tliat was required of ex-members of che Ivoyal Australian Air Eorce who joined that reserve was to register their names, addresses and occupations, and to attend once a month a so-called training night, when films were shown and oceasiona.ly a lecture was given. I am a member of that reserve, so I know what [ am talking about. Since then, as far as I know, no effective attempt has been made to improve that position. The General Reserve of the Royal Australian Air Force is literally a paper reserve, which does not mean a thing. As every year goes by, ex-members of the Royal Australian Air Force, especially air crew members, become further out of touch with modern developments. quently, it will take longer to make them familiar methods and air operations than would have been required if they had received further training. I realize that it is difficult to devise metliods by which members of the General Reserve can be kept in touch with modern developments, but I believe that it could be done. 1 have made a suggestion previously which I think is still worthy of consideration. I suggest that a touring squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force be formed to visit areas in which there are aerodromes but not permanent Royal Australian Air Force stations. The squadron could take to thoso aerodromes, say, Lincoln and Mustang aircraft, together with servicing crows, and, on the spot and there and then, give to members of the General Reserve the practical training that they require to keep them up to date. When I advanced that suggestion three or four yeairs ago, I was told that such a squadron would be too expensive, but I believe that the advantages that would be derived from it would more than offset the expense involved. It may be argued that what I have suggested would, in practice, be difficult to do. One aspect of air power in wbich the Allies never competed effectively with the Germans during the last war was in relation to the mobility of tbeir air forces. Thev were very much more statically inclined than the Germans were. We have to learn the necessity of. and achieve, mobility for our air squadrons, which is Mr Falkinder. essential in a country that has such large distances as has Australia. I believe, therefore, that such a touring squadron would be of the most practical benefit, not only to the permanent personnel who would carry out the training but also to the reservists whom they would train. There is one particular aspect of background training in regard to which I should Hke to pay a tribute to the refer to the Air Training Corps in which I am at present actively engaged, and of which I may therefore claim to speak with some knowledge. I am glad to observe that tbe whole concept of the Air Training Corps has been extended greatly. ConseEfforts are being made to make the training course more interesting for the cadets, with present-day training and the Minister should be congratulated on the improvement of conditions in the corps that has been achieved. The training of active reservists has also increased and there are now active training squadrons in every State. I have, however, some criticism to offer in relation to that matter. The Minister for A i r in the previous Government said about two years ago that tbe Air Board intended to attach at least one flight to Western Junction in Tasmania for the purpose of inaugurating active reserve training there. So far there has been no sign of the provision of that flight, and I ask the Minister to examine the position immediately in order to ascertain the steps that can be taken to have the undertaking of the previous Minister, Mr White, actually carried out, because it is well-known in Tasmania that the proposal was made, and many of the active reservists who would have been engaged in that training are disappointed because of the lack of fulfilment of it. I had hoped that the provision of that training flight would have been the thin edge of the wedge, and would have led to the establishment of a Royal Australian Air Force station, to which Tasmania is entitled, and which it should have. The lack of a permanent Royal Australian Air Force station and of a field permanently used for the training of cadets is a serious drawback to air training in Tasmania. I hope the Minister -will examine the matter from the long-term",59,Harbison Di D Not A To Supply Fighting Forces To The Limit Oi
137,Minister For Air ( Mr Mcmahon). I,"point of view, and that as a result of his examination a Royal Australian Air Force station will be established in Tasmania. I pay a tribute to the honourable member for Indi( Mr Bostock), who does not apeak very often, for his remarks on these Estimates, which are worthy of close attention. I consider that his general treatise on the subject of air power was extremety sound, although I may be prejudiced in that regard because I share his views. However, any fair-minded person wonld agree that the honourable member put the proposition forcibly. I have no doubt, just as the honourable member for Indi has no doubt, that the most important force to ensure the effective defence of this nation is the air force. It seems to be plain common sense to me that, with our geographical position, long coastline, small population and limited resources, we must rely on a force that could be concentrated quickly because it would have a high degree of mobility, and which, when compared with the' results that it could achieve, would cost us little. I believe tbe Air Force to be the only such force that we have. Nobody would be so foolish as to suggest seriously that there is no place in our defence scheme for the Army and the Navy, but I contend seriously that the Air Force should have predominance as the service on whicb we should rely for the protection of Australia. To that end I hope that the policy that is to be effected will be shaped accordingly. I was interested in the remarks of the honourable member for Evans( Mr pile them. I assure the honourable memOsborne) about naval defence forces. His contention that we require aircraft carriers and light escort vessels was perfectly sound and I hope that the Government will consider an extension of our present carrier strength by tbe acquisition of light aircraft carriers. It is possible that the largest kinds of aircraft carriers would be beyond our financial capabilities, but it would be of some' benefit if we obtained more air protection for our naval defences by adding more light aircraft carriers to the two that we already have. We mhrht even obtain some carriers of the utility type that the Americans used during the last war to protect surface vessels in the Atlantic. The provision of such carriers would assist us to give more air protection to the Navy. As I have said before, tbe protection of Australia resides in a large and effective air force. for Supply) |""5.11 I was interested in the remarks of tbe honourable member for Batman( Mr Bird) about stockpiling. I agree with him that in times of national emergency the nation should, as far as possible, have within its own control a group of strategic materials that are essential or desirable for the waging of a war of defence. In 1950, the Government gave consideration to that requirement and took steps to stockpile certain strategic materials, for which purpose it set aside large sums of money. At the same time as we were trying to stockpile strategic materials, however, other countries were also trying to do the samething, because such outbreaks of international activity tend to occur in cycles. The result of that fact was that a danger arose of prices being pushed up by the process. The Commonwealth moved rather carefully in relation to its purchases of scarce strategic materials, and as a result it may be said fairly that it purchased prudently and well. However, shortly afterwards the enthusiasm of the nations for stockpiling receded, because it was believed that the need for it was less urgent. Prices then began to fall and, oddly enough, the strategic commodities: that we had been seeking became more available, so much so that in some instances it became unnecessary to stockber for Batman and the committee that we are keeping this matter under close review, and that, as far as we are able to do so, we intend to ensure that the nation shall not be short of vital materials in an emergency. The honourable member mentioned tinplate, which was one of the materials that we had difliculty in stockpiling at the time that we wanted jt, because it was in short supply owing to the fact that other nations were competing for the available world supplies. Wc are now able to obtain it, if we wish, for stockpiling. However, as our own current stocks of tinplate have risen to a higher level than they have reached for a long time, and the national consumption",60,Harbison Di D Not A To Supply Fighting Forces To The Limit Oi
138,Mr Beale (Parramatta,"Ministe rfor tinplate having fallen, the need to stockpile tinplate has receded. plate is lower ! it was before. Self-praise is perhaps no recommendation, but I believe that in relation to stockpiling the Government has used methods that have saved the taxpayers a good deal of money that would have had to be expended had we proceeded in any other way than the way in which we did proceed. ment wise or lucky? lucky, but I do not care which so long as we saved the money. I have risen principally to reply to made late last night by the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr leave the matter at that until time and Wentworth) about uranium. What the honourable member said was of some importance, and I believe it to be necessary that I should reply to him. However, I preface my reply by pointing out that any Minister who wishes to speak on a subject such as this, is confronted by certain difficulties. Private members, on this side of the chamber at least, are allowed considerable freedom in what they say, and in the criticisms that they wish to make. That is how we conduct our affairs, and Ave shall continue to conduct them in that way. However, a Minister cannot always say all that he Avould like to say, as honourable members opposite who have had ministerial experience will concede. A Minister often -finds himself unable to defend himexaggerated statements on this matter. self or his government because the things that he would have to say to justify completely his own, and his government's -fiction, cannot be said publicly. But, witliin bhose limitations I believe that the committee should be made aware of certain facts. First, the honourable member for Mackellar said that the sum of £45,000 provided in the Estimates under the heading "" Defence Mineral Requirements"", was aai absurd allocation for the production of uranium in this country. Had he inquired about the matter-I remind the committee that -every member of the Cabinet is freely accessible to honourable members who seek explanations about items in the Estimates -h e could have ascertained that that item is merely a contingency vote which ha.r no real relation to the production of .uranium. Expenditure on uranium is to be found under other proposed votes. The honourable member spoke also pf the fabulous resources of uranium in Australia. In this chamber I have consistently tried to preserve a balance in this matter by saying that, although we hope and believe that we have substantial resources of uranium, it would be Avrong to exaggerate their value. 1 believe that the real worth of uranium to Australia is that its production will open up hitherto undeveloped territory, and Avill make this country more important than ever to its allies. That is some observations that were the great significance of uranium discoveries. Therefore, I am content to circumstances prove exactly what we. have. My next point arises out of the brilliant speech of the lionorable member for Indi( Mr Bostock) on the defence of our north. An over-statement of the value of our uranium resources might well have the most undesirable result of drawing tbe attention of our potential enemies, whoever they may be, to the strategic value of northern Australia and to its vulnerability, and so might start a chain of events which, in the long-run, would involve this country in an attack which otherwise it would not have suffered. Therefore, considerable restraint should be exercised .against making dramatic and It is alleged that Ave are not doing enough to hasten the production of uranium. We have been accused by the honourable member for Mackellar of having been content to follow the policy of the Labour party. I am .sure that my -friends opposite will not consider that to be a vice; but we have done more than that. Circumstances have changed, and many things that have already been done indicate quite clearly -that we have gone far beyond the Labour Government's policy. I shall enumerate some of those things.

142,Mr Beale,"It was both wise andmonths ago. Not until October, 1951, did the Bureau of Mineral Besources locate a seam of uranium that was found to be really valuable. Up to. that time, there was a strong possibility that exploration for uranium at Rum Jungle would be abandoned altogether. White's discovery had been made, but it had proved disappointing. Then we had tried again and again, and on two or three occasions had almost decided to abandon the project. However, we persevered. A tunnel was driven in another direction and, suddenly, a much more encouraging seam, was discovered. AaI have said, that was towards the end of 1951. At that time, there was no market for uranium in the immediate sense. We knew in a general way that uranium was valuable and we knew that our allies must be wanting it. Therefore, we took what we considered to be the proper step. As soon as the hew discovery was made, we brought to Australia some top-line distinguished representatives of the Atomic Energy Commission of the United States of America. They came here at our invitation. That carries the story to March of this year. When the visitors investigated the new find, they confirmed our belief that we had extremely encouraging prospects. The Commonwealth, of course, also gave great encouragement to the activities of the South Australian Premier, Mr energy for industrial as well as defence Playford, at Radium Hill. With the assistance of the Australian Government, ah agreement was reached, as the committee has heard, between the body known as the Combined Development Agency, the South Australian Government, and the Australian Government for the development of the South Australian deposits. immediately sent to the United States of America a shipment of some hundreds of tons of uranium ore from Rum Jungle. Our aim was to ascertain from the best metallurgists and mineralogists in the world the kind of treatment that would be required to produce the best results so that we could obtain the right plant to deal with the ore on the ""spot. In discussions with the representatives of the Combined Development Agency, a course of action was determined. That course of action, which has the approval of the Combined Development Agency, is now being followed by the Australian Government. In addition, at our invitation, the Combined Development Agency, which is a branch of the Atomic Energy Commission, has already sent three experts to Australia to help us. As honourable members have been informed, a draft agreement has been discussed in Washington and Australia. It is now back in Washington for further discussion. In the meantime, we have not been content merely to wait on events. We have begun negotiations with top-level mining companies in Australia. Those companies, I emphasize, are Australian and not foreign. We are endeavouring to arrange for the rapid development of Rum Jungle. I had my last discussion with my colleagues and with representatives of the organizations concerned only a few days ago, and I hope that, before very long, we shall have an agreement which will result in the development of the Rum Jungle area. Of course, wrapped up in this matter of the Rum Jungle uranium deposits, is also the wider question of what we are going to do with uranium in Australia, quite apart from its defence use. The Government has in existence, and has had for a year, a committee of very able scientists and administrators by which it is being advised on the future of atomic purposes. Sir John Cockcroft, a distinguished atomic energy expert, has been in this country at the invitation of the Australian Government. He has conferred with the Government, and has discussed these matters with the committee to which I have referred. Therefore, we have not lost sight of the fact At the same time, we that, quite apart from selling uranium ore to our allies, there is a future in Australia for industrial atomic energy. We are now considering what form of control should be employed. Is control to be exercised by a committee or commission, or by some other body? Decisions on these matters will also be made in the near future. Tbere are many other matters that I could refer to but I shall not deal with them because they are still in the process of negotiation and it would be unfair to others concerned if I talked about them now. I assure the committee that, far from merely following an outmoded policy and neglecting this matter, we have, since October last, applied from day to day a very active and vigorous policy which, I trust, will yield very great advantages to this country in the near future. [5.16] I should not have taken part in this debate but for the statement by the honourable member for Moore( Mr point that he is endeavouring to make. Leslie) that no person should be exempted from military service on religous-grounds and that no person had the right to hold religious views that made him believe that he should not engage in war and that it is wrong to kill a fellow man in self defence. The honourable member also said that every eligible person in Australia should be compelled to undergo military training or get out of the country. That is a cruel, old-fashioned and callous attitude to take on the subject of religous beliefs of other persons. The sincere religious belief of a person should be respected by every other member of the community. only to justify exemption from military service. said-that the religious views of a person, if they are sincerely held, are entitled to respect.

Does he not forget that we are. discussing the defence of this country? gave ample protection to conscientious ing with the matter very seriously and I trust that honourable members opposite are not treating it seriously when they suggest that the sincerely held religious views of other persons should be disregarded. Suppose that we Christians were in n minority in another country. How should we regard the Government of that oountry if, at the behest of the majority of its people, it enacted a law to compel Christians to eat meat on Good Eriday? The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member might touch a little on the subject of defence. He has already dealt at sufficient length with the great respect, Mr Deputy Chairman, I direct your attention to the fact that I am dealing with a matter that was dealt witb by the Minisiter for the Army( Mr Francis). The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -The honourable member has wandered away from Australia to other countries. done so merely for the purpose of showing that a person who sincerely holds a religious belief is entitled to have that belief respected by every person in the community. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -Order! The honourable member has already made that statement at least twice.

Regulation 9 dealt with the entitlement of the Minister to he represented on the hearing of au application or appeal. The regulation readThe Minister or any person authorized by him shall be entitled to be heard on the hearing of any application, appeal or review under these Begulations. Let me pause for a moment to examine the importance of tliese regulations. Those who wish to "" shanghai"" every eligible person into the Army, regardless of his sincerely held religious beliefs, should remember that these regulations, which operated during the period of the How can the Government justify, in greatest crisis in our history, gave to conpeace-time, its refusal to give to the scientious objectors the right of appeal people who hold conscientious beliefs against the decisions of magistrates against war the right to appeal against ordering them to serve in the armed. an order to undergo national service I'orces.

152,Mr Clyde Cameron,"Thes eof 1942, whicli operated throughout the war, so that persons who can prove to a court of appeal that their beliefs are sincerely held, may be exempted from training which is contrary to their beliefs. The case of Brian Mason has been published on numerous occasions, otherwise I should not refer to him by name now. That young man has been incarcerated in Holdsworthy correction camp because he conscientiously believes that he should not take part in war in either a combatant or a non-combatant capacity. Tbe fact that he is prepared to go to Holdsworthy indicates that he is not a coward in the sense that some people imagine that those who will not go to war are cowards. He has shown tremendous courage for a youth of the age of eighteen years. He has had to withstand the odium of 99 per cent, of public opinion, yet he has firmly maintained his beliefs, and has been prepared to go into a correction camp in New South Wales, away from his widowed mother in South Australia, who has no other son. This lad's father and grandfather were conscientious objectors. He was born and bred in a home where he was taught that it was wrong to kill his fellow-men. Whether his beliefs are right or wrong is not the question at issue. He sincerely holds the belief that it is wrong to kill his fellow-men, even in self defence, and no other person has the right to force him to do that which he believes to be wrong. Ever 3ince Christianity has been a force it has been aimed against intolerance. We all have been taught to believe in tolerance for the other man's point of view. inember tolerant? [ am. I ask the Government to have the same tolerance for this person's point of view as the authorities in Britain have for Quakers and similar people. En a democracy we are proud of the fact that we recognize points of view and do not crush a person into submission merely because he holds a different point of view to ours. I ask the Government to give to conscientious objectors an opportunity to prove to the satisfaction of a judge that their views are sincerely held. If they cannot prove that their beliefs are sincerely held the judge can dismiss their case. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) [5.31] -When the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) claims that he is tolerant he immediately brings me into the arena. I suggest that the honourable member's tolerance takes the form of expressing one view to-day and a difierent view tomorrow if he may thereby gain some party political capital out of an argument. I have the old fashioned idea that a person who enjoys the facilities and privileges of a democracy should not call upon other men to defend those facilities and privileges. He should himself be prepared to defend them. If he enjoys them at the expense of the life blood of another man he has no right to do so. Democracy demands that privileges shall be defended by the people on whom they are conferred. I do not suggest that there are people in this democracy who are not sincere in their conscientious objections. Of course, there are sueh people. The person to whom the honourable member has referred may be sincere in his views but I cannot understand them. The fact that 99 per cent, of public opinion is against this person does not prove that he is courageous. An exhibitionist may know that 99 per cent, of public opinion is against him but that does not prove that he is courageous. No courage can be claimed for this person who has challenged the law. The law is tolerant in this democracy. It is a just law. When a magistrate decides that such a person shall perform non-combatant service that service ranges from the sweeping of certain parts of a military establishment to attending religious services minority and handing out hymn books and prayer books. A case was mentioned in this chamber recently in which the only duty that a conscientious objector was required to perform was that of issuing prayer and hymn books and he refused",65,Harbison Di D Not A To Supply Fighting Forces To The Limit Oi

If he does not choose to rise and make his charges, let him remain -silent. I listened carefully to the speeches of honourable members opposite, including that of the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly), and I noticed that they -sought to take items from their context and endeavour to make party political capital out of them. I suggest that honourable members opposite should be certain of their premises before they draw conclusions. The honourable member for Grayndler is the Opposition Whip, and has had many years' experience in the Parliament. Therefore, his knowledge should certainly be greater than his speech indicated it to be. He said that the Government, through the Department of Defence Production, had placed no orders with secondary industry, particularly the electrical and textile industries. The honourable member knows full well that the matter of textiles is not a concern of the Department of Defence Production. If he does not know that he certainly should, because the Minister for Supply( Mr Victoria. I suggest that honourable memBeale) has spoken time and time again about the connection of his department with textiles. The Minister for Supply has proved conclusively that the textile industry has been very well treated by his department. The honourable member for Grayndler also said, in his wide, expansive way, that the Department of Defence Production was heavy from the Minister downwards. His subsequent remarks made it quite clear that he himself is light from the top downwards. He said that in the Department of Defence Production there were five assistant secretaries, five general managers, 90 professional and technical officers, thirteen assistant managers, 49 heads of sections and 237 engineers and technical officers. I know that the honourable member was trying to be facetious, and that he endeavoured to lighten an otherwise dull and dreary debate. He is well aware that there are many government factories and partment of Defence Production, and that most of the officers he menlishments and not in the administrative side of the department. He tried to convince people outside the Parliament that the Government condoned the employment of surplus public servants. He mentioned 49 heads of sections, seven managers, and numbers of other officers, merely to bolster a fallacious argument. The Department of Defence Production controls an aircraft factory at Fishermen's Bend, Victoria, aircraft repair factories at Parafield and Northfield, South Australia, an ammunition factory at Footscray, Victoria, an ammunition factory at Finsbury, South Australia, an explosives factory at Maribyrnong, Victoria, an explosives factory at Mulwala, New South Wales, an explosives factory at St. Mary's, New South Wales, an ordnance' factory at Maribyrnong, Victoria, an ordnance factory at Bendigo, Victoria, and an ordnance factory at Echuca, Victoria. We also have a marine engine works at Port Melbourne, Victoria, a small arms factory at Lithgow, New South Wales, and a central drawing office at Maribyrnong, bers, and the people generally, will agree that the department is not topheavy with administrative staff. WhatI have said shoulld make it clear to the honourable member that the majority of",66,Harbison Di D Not A To Supply Fighting Forces To The Limit Oi
156,Mr Haylen,The magistrate might,67,Harbison Di D Not A To Supply Fighting Forces To The Limit Oi
157,Mr Eeic J. Haeeison,"There is the officers that he referred to work in the Oovernment factories, and not in one department. The honorabie member for Grayndler also stated that even though very many administrative officers were employed in t.he department, no Government orders were being given to industry. I think r.hat I have made it quite clear that the bulk of the officers he mentioned are not administrative officers at all. They are high executive and technical officers in charge of the Government factories. The lionorable member mentioned the electrical industry. He dealt mainly with radio and its branches, such as telecommunications. It is quite true that io tbe present we have not allocated to local industry more than about £1,589,000 worth of orders for this particular form of manufacture. However, t.he whole matter is one of relativity. The honourable member believes that the present £1,589,000 worth of orders is not sufficient, but I submit that it is certainly substantial. ""We have about £3,805,859 worth of material in course of being processed, and will eventually farm it out to industry. We also have £3,191,700 worth of material, approval to process which has been given, but in both instances the quantities I have mentioned are subject to revision by the Services. Until orders are placed with tbe Department of Defence Production by the Services, we can neither process tbe items nor send the orders out. Therefore, although about £7,000,000 worth of material is at present being processed, before that quantity goes out it will be subject to revision by the Services. The honourable member said that we have officers to burn, and are doing nothing to keep them fully occupied. I suggest that he might bring himself up to date with the facts and that then he would not waste the time of the committee. Honourable members have listened to a very interesting debate on defence, which, T believe, is the most important matter that we have to deal with in the Estimates. I suggest that defence must be pre-eminent in all our considerations, because not only our own safety but also the safety of the nation is involved in our defence preparations. However, I maintain that the £200,000,000 to be expended on defence in this financial year is too much. It is more than this country can afford. able members of the Opposition would make up their minds about whether it is too much or not enough. own opinion. I believe that more of the money allocated to defence should be expended on aircraft, and less in some of the other suggested channels. The importance of aircraft in the defence of Australia has been the theme of the speeches of many honourable members in this debate. Recently, an article by H . H . Cox was published in the Sydney Sun. I consider that that article proved that it will be impossible for us to defend this country unless we have powerful allies to assist us. Parts of the articlereadNomiiERN AUSTRAL IA WIDE OPEN TO North Australia is an open invitation to ..uy aggressor. An Eastern army could walk in unhindered anywhere between Broome and Cairns. They could dig in, live off the land and build up bases before anybody on the remote southern fringe of the continent, 2,000 miles away, could raise a finger to stop them. Everybody must acknowledge that those are the facts. We should expend our money in other ways. One of our first tasks should be to establish and maintain friendly relations with other countries so that we shall have allies to help us in the event of war. Honourable members surely will acknowledge that we cannot defend Australia without aid. We are expending a great deal of money in Korea at present. I do not oppose that expenditure, but I object to leaving the question of war or peace in the hands of military authorities. The military leaders of the opposing forces in Korea have held numerous conferences for the purpose of arranging an armistice. I contend that a satisfactory settlement will never be made by the military leaders because each side will refuse to make concessions to the other. It is up to us to. do our best to nut the negotiations in the bands of civilians. '",67,Harbison Di D Not A To Supply Fighting Forces To The Limit Oi

160,Mr Davies,"I am expressing myOne matter that has caused me grave concern is the sale by the Government of machinery that has been of great benefit to Australia. The Government is privateenterprise mad. It wants to turn everything over to private enterprise. It owns a large quantity of machinery that is used on the waterfront and in the coal mines, but it intends to dispose of all of it. Tbe Minister for Supply( Mr is used for the purpose of producing Beale) said recently, in reply to a question, that the Government proposed to sell all the government-owned machinery on the wharfs. If it does so, the already along without it. We can increase our unsatisfactory shipping situation in Australia will become immeasurably worse. We have heard numerous complaints about the slow turn-round of ships in our ports. This machinery was provided for the purpose of expediting the turnround of ships. Everybody who has travelled overseas knows that better cargo handling equipment than we have in Australia is used in other countries. Australian wharf labourers are obliged to use hand trolleys in order to do the work that is done overseas with modern electrical equipment. The result is that it takes twice as long to load and unload ships in Australia as it takes in other countries. This machinery must be retained for the benefit of Australia. Our coal-mines are producing a record volume of coal at present as a result of the operations of the Joint Coal Board, which has done a wonderful job. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN!-Orde r 1 consideration.

The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN I definitely rule that the honourable member will not be in order in discussing that subject. sider that the honourable member for Cunningham is able to link coal production with defence production, and I ask you, Mr Deputy Chairman, to allow him to continue his speech.

Opposition members should realize the truth I am speaking to of that statement. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr W. M .

We all agree with that statement, but we are bound to recognize that a threat of war exists, and that we must take measures to ensure our protection. All honourable members should approve the amount of money that has been allocated by the Government for defence purposes.

(Ordered to be considered together.) -The heading "" Miscellaneous Services"" is appropriate because it covers, a miscellany of items which could merit close Attention. Unfortunately, in the time at' I .shall not conmy disposal, it is possible to select only an item here and there for consideration. The first item to which I should like to refer is that appearing in the Estimates of the Department of the Treasury under item 11, "" National Savings Campaign, £10,000"". It is significant that the amount that is set aside for the national savings campaign this year is £10,000 compared with £20,000 last year, but of the £20,000 that was voted last year only £1,800 was expended. The reduction is indicative of the paltry way in which this Government has attempted to approach the important matter of savings by the community. Honourable members know honourable well the failure of this Government to define properly a fixed interest rate and the uncertainty that has been engendered as a result. The lack of confidence that now exists in the so-called money market is significant. During the war, appeals were made to the people on patriotic grounds to assist the economy and attempt to halt the effects of inflation by putting their savings into I rise to order, and sugvarious government bonds. The interest rate was held for a long period at the low rate of 3$ per cent. Now some semi-government bodies are experiencing difficulty in obtaining finance from loans when the rate of interest is almost as The r e high as 5 per cent. That was indicated in a question that was asked to-day by. the honourable member for Darebin( Mr. Andrews). Honourable members may have received to-day, as I did, a communication from a group of co-operative housing societies in Victoriai n which tbey set out the effect on the financing of a house when the interest rate was raised from 3$ per cent, to 4£ per cent. On a house which costs about £3,000, the extra cost to the home buyer is about £350 over a term of 30 years. That sum may not appear to be large when"" it is said quickly, but it is a deterrent to people who are endeavouring to acquire a home for themselves. The failure of this Government to set a firm interest rate has repercussions that flow into other channels of finance. The very niggardly commitment for encouraging savings that is provided this year in the Estimates is an indication of how low in the Government's mind its estimate of the investing capacity of the people must",70,Chinese Invasion

Honourable members on this side of the chamber have endeavoured to point out that those who want to save money are not interested so much in the rate of interest as they are in the security of the investment that they undertake. Eor nearly ten years the interest rate was held at 3£ per cent., but in the twelve to eighteen months that this Government has had control of the interest rate in its hands, the rate has risen substantially. It is idle for the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) to suggest that this is not a matter for the Government but one for the Australian Loan Council. This Government must set the tone of the money market generally. The other commitments that are involved in these miscellaneous items of treasury expenditure show how important is the loan market generally in the finances of the Australian Government. Quite a number of items listed show commitments and expenses associated with the loan market. Probably it is true that half the investments in Australia come from the Australian Government itself through its various agencies, from financial institutions such as insurance companies and, to some extent, from banks. The amount which individuals pay into the total savings is probably a comparatively insignificant part of the whole. government bonds were regarded at one time as a legitimate channel of investment for small investors. During the war, a special savings scheme was instituted for their benefit. The medium was war savings certificates which could be bought for 16s. each and over a period of years, with interest at 3J per cent'., increased in value to £1. The important factor in that investment for the small investor was that he could not lose his capilal. The value of the certificates increased progressively on each day that they were in existence because interest was accruing virtually all the time. It is difficult to understand why that kind of investment has not been reinstituted for the encouragement of small investors. Savings certificates of that type should be available continuously. The British Government has a tap loan which is open perpetually. Any one who has money to invest can put it into the tap Ur. loan from day to day. He does not have to wait until a new loan is launched. If he has £100 for investment he can go to a bank or post office and put the money into a bond. An Australian investor in the old type of war savings holding could be sure that his capital was intact. For the small investor the security of the loan is all-important. No one can suggest with truth that it matters to the small investor with £100 or £200 to invest whether the interest rate is 3£ per cent, or 4 per cent. He would prefer to get £4 instead of £3 10s. on hi3 investment, but if he is sure that his capital is secure at the lower rate of interest, he is perfectly willing to accept it. The Treasurer seems to think that the Australian market will not absorb loans unless the rate of interest goes to 4£ per cent, or thereabouts. If that is the case, it is difficult to understand why in New Zealand, a country that is similar to Australia in many ways, the interest rate now is about 3J per cent. In the United States of America the interest rate on government securities is as low as 2} per cent, and 3 per cent. The fact is that in those two countries, the governments are determined to fix the interest rate as low as possible and to support it. The Australian Government is not prepared to do that. It has let the interest rate advance and the effect Nevertheless, has been serious for every form of investment. Primarily tbe gilt-edged rate of interest sets the scale for other rates. The higher the rate for gilt-edged securities, tbe higher becomes the bank overdraft rate and the mortgage rate for tbe purchase or building of houses, something which is of great importance to the man wbo wants to provide himself with a home. Usually, a man cannot provide £2,000 or more in cash for the purchase or building of a home. He has to raise a mortgage, and if the interest rate is 4£ per cent., interest payments on the original indebtedness will bring the total cost of the home up to about £3,500. It is important to keep interests rates as low as possible. The War Service Homes scheme is financed on an interest rate of a little more than 3$ per cent., but ordinary bome purchasers must now pay 4$ per cent., or even more. Indeed, Crean. the ruling interest rate is now rapidly approaching 5 per cent., which it waa many years ago. Every increase of 4 per cent, in the interest rate adds hundreds of pounds to the total cost of a home. The Government's attitude towards interest rates and wages is contradictory. Ct claims that, in order to arrest inflathat the decisions of the Australian Loan tion, wages should be pegged, but its whole policy is directed towards raising interest rates, and the economy of the country is affected to some extent by interest rates as by wage rates. There is unemployment in the community, and industry should be stimulated in order to provide more employment, but industry cannot be stimulated by raising the interest rate. The Treasurer has evaded his responsibility in this matter. He must know that when the national debt is approximately £3,000,000,000, as at present, every increase of 1 per cent, in the interest rate represents an additional £30,000,000 in interest payments. Government loans never seem to be paid off. They are only converted from time to time', and if conversions have to be made on a rising market the interest burden must steadily increase. The Chifley Government fixed the rate of interest for government borrowings at 3£ per cent. If loans raised at that rate have to be converted at 4& per cent., interest payments over the whole field of our indebteddescribed as homes of an adequate and ness will increase by £45,000,000. This Government professes to favour a policy of lower taxation, but bow can taxes be reduced if the interest burden on public indebtedness is constantly increasing? The Government's niggardly attitude on the subject of national savings seems to indicate that it has thrown in the sponge and forfeited the confidence of the public. cated bomes. When challenged in the Tbe DEPUTY CHAIEMAN ( Mr houses, the Minister for Housing sugBowden) -Order. ' The honourable memgested by innuendo that his Government, bev's time has expired. approach of the bonorable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) to the problem he discussed is not unfamiliar.

I consulted the monwealth had failed to provide enough Clerk, and was informed that it would money for the State governments to be in order for me to discuss housing spend. He knows perfectly well that tha under these proposed votes. decisions of the Australian Loan Council are, in fact, the decisions of a majority of the States. The Commonwealth has frequently been outvoted by the States on questions of financial policy. It is, therefore, a specious argument to sayCouncil are the responsibility of the Commonwealth. Just by way of a change, I propose to mention the money that has been given by the Commonwealth to the State governments under the terms of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. For the ensuing year the States will receive from the Commonwealth £30,000,000 under this arrangement. Of that amount, Queensland has been allocated £3,730,000, which will make a total of £15,418,000 received by Queensland since the agreement came into operation. Of that amount, no less than £11,000,000 has been provided by the present Government in a little over two years. Unfortunately, the money has not been always faithfully applied. When the scheme was first introduced, it was stated that 235,000 persons were living in substandard dwellings. The purpose of the scheme was to relieve those unfortunate people by providing them with what was hygienic standard. However, the Queensland Government, instead of improving the conditions that existed, has aggravated them. Against the best advice of experts, the Queensland Government contracted, in May, 1950, to buy 750 French prefabricated homes, and in 195.1 to buy a further 135 French prefabriState parliament on the quality of these had bought them because The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -Order!

190,Mr Morgan,"I take it, Mr is not of much use to them if they arebody, and, therefore, the remedy is to be found outside the body by treatment with drugs. On the other hand, the manipulative theory is propounded on the basis that disease arises within the body as a result of bodily structures, such as the bony segments being thrown out of alinement and causing intereference with the nervous system and the flow of life force or energy from the brain to the various organs and cells of the body. Consequently, the cure of disease must also be found in the body, by rectifying the interference and thus enabling Nature to clear up the diseased condition. I shall not canvass the pros and eons of those two theories. I believe that I have said sufficient to show that manipulative therapy should be made available in repatriation institutions, particularly in view of the fact that, in the majority of instances, ex-servicemen are subject to many shocks, falls and tensions. I am aware that physiotherapy treatment is available to patients in these institutions, but it is to a large degree a hit or miss method. It is only a palliative, because it is not fully effective in cases of displacement of bony segments. Likewise, shock treatment is largely a hit or miss process, which, in many instances, causes harm to the patient. Experience in recent years has shown that many of the drugs now being used in repatriation hospitals are totally ineffective because they are administered to treat the effect and not the cause of disease. In respect of the so-called wonder drugs, medical science is completely off the track. I quote the following extracts from an article by Dr. Barrett Cooper that appear in tbe current issue of Australian Monthly:Like sulpha and penicillin, the new antibiotics are raising strains of resistant germs. But, properly used, they're still valuable lifemore British immigrants have been savers. Two people suffering from pneumonia died recently at one of Sydney's largest hospitals. Their deaths were deeply significant. Rach of them had been expected to recover. They were seriously ill , but no worse, outwardly, than thousands of pneumonia patients who had been saved by sulpha drugs or a r t i Motics (penicillin and the rest). The two patients who died had received f u l l doses of penicillin, streptomycin, and, later, chloramphenicol and aureomycin. But the antibiotics did not save them. Hr. Morgan. The two pneumonia deaths are evidence of a recent development which is causing much concern to medical men. Disease bugs which collapsed under the first onslaughts of the sulpha, drugs and, later, of penicillin and other antibiotics, have begun to fight back. Many of the disease organisms have developed resistance to such drugs, and the descendants of these harmful organisms are abroad in thc world, ready to take on an antibiotic whenever they meet one. It is not a happy situation. Doctors are worried. Medical journ from every continent are reporting failures of the antibiotic drugs in diseases for which they were formerly successful, and editorials on the occurrence of "" antibiotic resistance"" have anpeared in both the British and American Medical Association Journals, which go to over a quarter of a million doctors throughout the world. Whilst an ex-serviceman's disablement may not be directly attributable to war service The DEPUTY CHAIBMAN.^-Order! The honourable member's time hap expired. The honourable member for Phillip( Mr Fitzgerald) has declared that the Government should not be a party to any proposal for the mass immigration of Germans. He made his remarks in such a venemous way that they were calculated to stimulate both class and racial feeling. Having regard to the atmosphere of conflict that exists in the international sphere, they can only have the effect of helping the Communist cause. I say without equivocation that every supporter of the Government is opposed to the mass immigration of Germans to this country. Mass immigration can be justified only in respect of persons of British stock. I am happy to say that a similar preference for British people was shown by preceding governments. Since 1947, 300,000 brought to this country than the total of immigrants of all other nationalities who have come here. This Government has not sponsored the immigration of a single German to Australia. Germane who have emigrated to Australia have been sponsored by State semi-governmental authorities mainly for the purpose of training unskilled Australians in specific industries. The thought that has",75,Subsidies
191,Mr Haworth (Isaacs) [8.37],"been promulgated by lionorable members opposite that it is the intention of this Government to bring 10,000 German immigrants to this country during this year is completely wrong. It is absolutely untrue. The Government intends, during this year, to bring out only 1,500 skilled German artisans and their families after they have been properly screened. The Opposition has engaged in propaganda about class hatred and has stated that the Gorerninent intends to bring out unscreened German Nazis, in order to arouse a certain fear in many of our immigrants who have suffered acts of terrific torture by our former enemies. The issue that emanates from such propaganda is un-Christian. honourable members opposite appear to derive a sadistic pleasure by arousing chose fears. They have, in fact, engaged in a form of germ warfare, such as our enemies have suggested that the United States has resorted to in China. These Communist tactics appear to have the approval of some members of the Opposition. I commend to them an article that was published in Australia's National Neius-Weekly, on the 30th April. It portrays the admirable spirit that is possessed by former members of Lancaster bomber squadrons. They invited to their ANZAC Day re-union a former German Luftwaffe pilot who had brought down some of the members of their organization over enemy territory during the war. The article readsHaving been forced into a war and emerged safely from it, the Christian man allows no hatreds to fester in his heart. To allow personal or racial hatreds to survive a war is to ww the seeds of further battles. The man who claims to be anti-war, but spreads racial hatred, is not a man of truth. We are bound as Christians to hate evil. We are forbidden to hate men-eve n evil men. . . . This does not mean we must neglect certain precautions in dealing with nations who have brought us into wars we did not desire. The Communists have done more than any other people to foster racial hatred in the democracies. True communism is opposed to the teachings of Chrisianity, and therefore, the Communists derive pleasure from provoking discontent amongst our immigrants, particularly those who have been tortured by our former enemies. Mr .FITZGERALD -""We are not discussing the proposed vote for immigration. member for Phillip( Mr Fitzgerald) is typical of the persons who foment increased racial and class hatred in this country. I am opposed to mass German immigration into Australia, not for the reason that has been expressed by the honourable member for Philip, but for the reason that the screening system loses some of its effectiveness under pressure of numbers. We must be particularly vigilant to prevent people with Nazi ideas from entering this country. A careful scrutiny Some to this end can be maintained only if relatively small numbers of Germans are selected at a time. I am glad to know that the Government does not intend , to engage in the mass movement of German people to this country. The Congressof the Australian Council of Trades Unions that was held in Melbourne earlier this week made a very stupid recommendation to the effect that no more skilled artisans should be brought to this country. There is a dearth of skilled artisans in Australia. While that state of affairs persists tbere will continue to be a disproportionate number of unskilled workers in Australia. A bala.noe must always be maintained between the number of skilled and unskilled workers, because the unskilled men may learn from the skilled artisans. To prohibit any more skilled artisans from coming to this country would have an adverse effect on our economy. I shall now refer to the Australian Red Cross Society, which I consider has not been adequately provided for in tlfe proposed vote for the Department of Health. I refer particularly to tbe blood transfusion service, which is an integral part of civil air defence. The Government proposes to expend about i-200,000,000 on defence during this financial year. Therefore, it is reasonable that we should appropriate a small amount to enable the Australian Red Cross Society to expand its blood transfusion service during any emergency that may arise.

Since 1946, the Australian Eed Cross has been responsible for providing such services throughout Australia and its territories. Lack of finance and the necessity to provide blood banks to meet peace-time requirements are imposing great stresses and strains on the society. Obviously, it must prepare for the possibility of war, in much the same manner as the Government has acted in providing for the appropriation of £200,000,000 for defence purposes. If the Government, even at this late stage, made an allocation from that huge sum to the society, it would be doing the right thing. All that the society asks for is authority to proceed with the stock-piling of blood for use in a national emergency, a financial guarantee from the Government, and publicity for the need for more blood donors. Eveni f all those steps were taken, the position of the society would still be difficult, and much hard work would be required to be done by many people who work for it voluntarily. I commend the society to the Government, and request that sympathetic consideration be given to the possibility of assisting contain an item of £18,000 in respect of it in its work. -Ordinarily , I should not have risen repatriation services is excessive. to speak on the Estimates for War and Repatriation Services.

When we examine the items under the heading "" Public Debt Charges "", we discover that £43,262,000 is to be appropriated for the payment of interest on loans for war and repatriation purposes, and £16,087,000 for the payment of sinking fund charges on such loans, a total of £59,349,000. The cost of administering our repatriation services is out of all proportion to the benefits that ex-servicemen are deriving from them. The Estimates for the Repatriation Commission show that £2,430,000 is to be expended upon the salaries and allowances of permanent, temporary and casual employees and also upon extra duty pay, £73,700 upon travelling and subsistence expenses, £53,000 upon office requisites and equipment, £80,000 upon postage, telegrams and telephone services, and £35,000 upon incidental and other expenses.

The Repatriation Commission accepted his illness as having been war-caused, and allowed him a pension. It informed him that he was suffering from coronary occlusion. Twelve months later the ex-serviceman died and the commission granted his wife a full war widow's pension. Yet the widow of his friend, who had died seven years before of the same complaint, had not been allowed a pension, and, as I have said, is still working for a living. I wish to know what is wrong with the Department of Repatriation. Honourable members opposite need not take my word alone for these cases. I suggest that they appoint somebody to examine the facts of the cases that I can produce. There are also cases of other men who have been receiving small war pensions and have been told that they are fit for certain kinds of work. I shall quote two certificates that were issued by the Repatriation General Hospital at Concord in respect of the employment of two men. One certificate reads in f u l l Hospital Road, Concord, N.S.W. l l t h May, 1950. District Employment Officer, Commonwealth Employt. Service. 2-4 Pacific Street, Newcastle. Dear Sir, Mr Joshua Plumb has been a patient in this Hospital. He has been suffering from* neurosis and his medical restrictions aro to avoid severe and moderate respiratory or cardiac strain or physical exertion, general muscular activity or agility, walking or standing imposing strain or fatigue, heat causins sweating or strain, humidity, cold wetness and dampness, vapid climatic changes, noise vibration or glare. The doctor also states that it is desirable to avoid sustained mental concentration and emotional upsets. His age is 54 years, married and his address is 24 Davis Avenue. White Gates, Wallsend, Xewcastle. He requires a light employment. Any assistance that you may be able to l ender him will be appreciated. Yours faithfully , (Sgd.) Medical Superintendent. Mr Griffiths. I ask honourable members opposite, and the Minister for Health and the Minister for the Army( Mr Erancis), who are at the table, what sort of work any employer would give that man. A similar certificate in respect of another ex-serviceman, which was forwarded to the same employment officer, readThe above member is being discharged from this establishment to-day and w ill require light employment. This employment must be such that tlie following activities are not called into playgeneral muscular activity, walking or standing for long periods, bending, squatting, pushing,, l if t in g or throwing, climbing or balancing. Ae you can see, this limits member's field of employment considerably, and probably suggests light process work, gateman, or other such sedentary or semi-sedentary occupation. It would be almost impossible to find suitable employment for such a man. One of those men receives a 20 per cent, war pension, and the other receives a 30 per cent, war pension. Representations about dozens of such cases have been made to me. One of them concerns an ex-serviceman who tried to commit suicide on four occasions. His wife had to go out and cut him down with a knife when he was trying to hang himself. He suffers from spinal trouble and receives only a 50 per cent, pension. He receives medical assistance at times when he is* under medical observation, but the total of his income is only about £11 12s. a fortnight on which he has to keep himself, his wife and one child. People say that the Repatriation Department is doing a goob job. I say that the administrative officers of the department have done a bad job, because those cases have come to their notice time and time again, and they know that the present provisions of the Repatriation Act do not cover these men. As a result, men who are suffering from heart complaints and war neurosis are unable to obtain justice. I know of one case of a returned soldier who committed an assault during a fit of neurosis, and in consequence has been rotting for two years in the criminal section of the mental hospital at Morrisset. I ask the Minister to examine these cases. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -Order! G. FrrzHTLL The honourable gentleman's time has expired. for Health) [9.7.] -It seems to be rather late in the day for the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Griffiths) to level a charge about excessive administration cost.3 in the Kepatriation Department because the ' expenses now incurred by the department are almost identical, in ratio, with the department's administrative expenses during the entire period of the Labour Government's regime. I repudiate entirely his statement that the Eepatriation Department has done a bad job. From the very inception of the repatriation administration there has been an insistence that the Repatriation Commission be formed of ex-servicemen, and that the doctors who examine applicants should themselves be ex-servicemen. Applicants have also been able to state their cases before an entitlement committee consisting of ex-servicemen. Then or twelve years ago the Parliament established a non-party committee on repatriation in which members of all parties co-operated. That committee made a unanimous report to the Parliament. I was not a member of that committee, although I am an ex-serviceman, but the Minister for the Army( Mr Francis) was a member of it. It made certain proposals which, it said, represented the unanimous opinion of both sides of the Parliament. I was able to secure an additional concession to those suggested, because in this chamber I fought for, and finally won, a 100 per cent, increase of tuberculosis pensions for patients in hospitals. If it is true that hardships exist, then I should like to know why, since this Government came into office, honourable members opposite have not co-operated in the all-party committee, which is the proper authority to deal with-this matter. I rise also to deal with certain other matters that have been raised in the course of this debate. The honourable inember for Isaacs( Mr Haworth) has mentioned the Red Cross blood transfusion service. Last year, we offered to assist nation in the use of some of those drugs the Australian Red Cross Societyi f it would ..undertake the fractionation of blood serum, to enable the establishment of a blood bank in dry form for use in the event of a national calamity-civi l or military. A sum of money was included in the Estimates for that purpose. It has not yet been expended, but the Red Cross Society is building up its organization to enable that work to be done. ""We also offered the free services of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories for the handling of the blood in order that fractionation could be carried out. In addition, at the recent conference of Commonwealtb and State Ministers, we informed the Premiers that we were prepared to discuss with the State governments the question of financial assistance to the Australian Red Cross Society to enable it to extend its valuable work throughout the Commonwealth. Further, we have encouraged the production of a fluid which can be used as a substitute for blood serum and can be kept indefinitely. It is called "" Dexterin"" or "" Inter-Dex "". A factory has been built in Sydney and the production of this fluid is about to start. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) told a gloomy story about our national health, but his prognostication? are not supported by the declining rate of deaths from disease. In fact, during the last 30 years, deaths .from diseases have been reduced almost by half. Foi1 instance, tuberculosis and pneumonia no longer head our list of killer diseases as they did 30 or 40 years ago. In fact, they are no longer in the first ten on the list. The main killer to-day is accidents, and the medical profession can hardly be blamed for that. Cancer and heart disease are the next killers but that is chiefly because of the increasing longevity of the people. This Government has done everything possible to reduce the incidence of diseases in the country. For instance, we have made free to the people of Australia the wonder drugs which, in recent years, have done so much either to prevent diseases or to curtail their duration. Diseases which a few years ago had to be endured by sufferers for weeks or perhaps months and which often led to death from sequelae are now curable in a few days. It is true that, there has been a certain lack of discrimiby certain members of the medical profession, but we have taken various steps to obviate that danger. The medical profession itself is most active in this field. The British Medical Association has appointed committees to deal with this",79,Warning Oh Wonder Drugs

I shall refer, not to what the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) has said,but to cer1 tain very compelling matters that have been put before the committee by the honourable member for Shortland( Mr Griffiths) Those matters involve, not the f terms of the Repatriation Act or its benefits, but the administration of that act. I do not think that the act couldhave been drafted in clearer terms. I do not claim it to be entirely the work of Labour governments, but Labour governments contributed substantially to it, as the Minister for Health is well aware. Originally the question that arose was whether disabilities suffered by an ex-serviceman many yeafs after his war service eould be connected with that war set-vice. On several occasions, this Parliament attempted to solve that problem. Ih every country of the EinallVj it laid down in the clearest terms lihat when such a question arose, the onus was on the Repatriation Department to prove that there was no connection between the war service and the disability Or physical condition that had caused incapacity.

203,Mr Roberton (Riverina) [9.25],"those engaged in them tried to do so. All our primary industries were established on the basis that the price that the world was prepared to pay for a commodity should be the prevailing price in Australia. When world prices were remunerative, our primary industries were prosperous, and when world prices were unremunerative, our primary industries were depressed. they experienced conditions of comparative prosperity followed by conditions of comparative depression. I have very vivid recollections of having spent the Sunday before the declaration of war in September, 1939, with the right honourable gentleman who was then, as he is now, the Prime Minister of Australia ( Mr Menzies), and the gentleman who is now Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator McLeay). On that day, and in the days that immediately preceded ahd followed it, 22 primary commodities were being shipped from Australia to the markets of tbe world, and every one of them was being sold at a loss. The only solution of the problem that the producer could offer was to increase his production in the hope that by so doing he would extricate himself from his difficulties; but the more producers increased their production the greater was the volume of unconsumed and accumulated stocks. As the volume of unconsumed stocks rose so did world parity prices fall. Increased production, instead of remedying the situation, merely aggravated its serious effect on the economy of the country. Those circumstances existed in all our primary industries. Tied as they were to the chariot wheels of export parity price they had no hope of escape. When it was suggested to the Australian people that, because of their high standard of living, they might be prepared to agree to the fixation of an Australian price for primary commodities consumed in Australia, they reiected the proposal largely because they did not then, as tbey do not even now, comprehend the problem that has been constantly before those of us who have to study these matters. I should like to quote a passage from a book which was published in 19^5 dealing with this question. It reads as follows:There is a brand of pure patriotism that imposes a simple obligation on every Mr Roberton. man and woman to understand the cause of the disaster that hus afllK-ted, not only tlie entire rural economy, but the complete national economy that has led to soil sterility and all its attendant evils and to the depopulation of the country. Every cost is, in thc final analysis, a cost against the land. Every cost is passed on until , ultimately, it reaches the land, where it stops. It is a cost against the land and it stays with the land until' it is met and discharged in f u l l . Every Consequently tax is. in the final analysis, a tax against the land. It may be that it is levied against the individual, and it may be tliat, with great self-sacrifice and fortitude the individual meets the tax out of current income or hard won savings; but since current income or hard won savings come from the land by devious ways it is obvious that the lax is a tax against the land. It may be that it is levied against industry and it may be that industry elects to meet the tax from reserves or accumulated profits, instead of following the normal procedure of passing the tax on. It make* no difference. Since reserves or accumulated -profits come from the land, it follows tliat, before or after the event, the tax is a tax against the land. Similarly, every debt is a debt against the land whether it is contracted by the State or by the lowly individual in the State. There are no means of repaying debts except from the land, and sooner or later the land is committed. Just as the State or the individual in the State is .pledged tn meet thc debt, so is the land pledged, since neither the State nor the individual huve resources outside the land. That is what the land is for. Tliat is the purpose of the land' and it has no other purpose. Thc land must maintain its people and all their excesses. When the land fails, the people perish. There is no suggestion that the land should escape from its responsibilities, but there is more than a suggestion that intelligent people should recognize an l appreciate the immensrity of these responsibilities and their timeless character. There has been no recognition of these responsibilities and it is increasingly necessary that-people should understand the task of rehabilitating the primary industries on a scale that will meet the present need of the community. Up to the declaration of war all our primary industries were tied to export parity prices. Then, because of tbe national emergency, under the National Security Eegulations, primary products were acquired by the Government in the interests of the people. When the export parity prices rose, the primary producers were deprived of the full value of their product. They hoped that when the war terminated the former state of affairs would be restored, and that they would good again have the right to dispose of their product tliemselves. All sorts of specious arguments were put forward by the socialist government of that time for the continuation of those schemes that had been necessary to meet the national emergency. For all practical purposes, those schemes socialized the major primary industries. When the National Security Regulations were terminated, it was hoped by tbose of us who try to understand these problems that the primary producers would be allowed to enjoy the comparative prosperity that naturally comes from remunerative prices. They were denied that right by the socialist government, which controlled the sale of all primary products except wool. If certain successful the wool-grower would have lost a great part of his returns, too. The only way in which the producers were able to compensate for falling export parity prices was by increasing production. The producer can now protect himself against tbe machinations of the socialist party and against any manipulation that may deprive him of the true value of his product. For the first time in the history of primary production in this country the producers are in a position to benefit from literary merit. I suggest that the retheir own production. Unless justice is done to primary producers there will be a contraction of production to the minimum necessary to keep the individual producer."" Such a level of production would be wholly inadequate for the economy of the country. It would be wholly inadequate for the major schemes of development that are necessary even in the next few years. Therefore I make an impassioned appeal to this committee to return to the producers the right to market tbeir own products in their own way. Having done that it will be the duty of tbe Australian Agricultural Council and of this committee to reduce costs so that, whether the export parity price rises or falls, production will continue. This committee and the Australian Agricultural Council must also maxe available to the producers in all industries, whether primary or secondary, the services that are necessary for their development. If this task is faced with courage and -determination we shall attract men back to the land, production will be increased and the country will be provided with a substantial basis for prosperity. honourable member for Riverina( Mr Roberton) has been supporting the Grovernment for the last three years while almost every aspect of primary production has declined. He should have realized by now that his words are not likely to alter the Government's policy and that he will have to take other action to effect an improvement in the situation of which he has complained. I wish to speak on that part of the Miscellaneous Services Estimates for machinations had been the Prime Minister's Department which concern the Commonwealth Literary Fund. Last week I protested against the manner in which a small clique of literary leftists-unde r cover and open Communists and "" fellow travellers ""-were exploiting the fund and the taxrayer by obtaining a percentage of fellowships out of all proportion to their literary merit and their numbers. It was clear to me that political bias was entering into the judgment of the advisory committee, and that the awards were not being made according to action of the. Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and his supporters to my charges was remarkable. I was accused of needlessly sneering, witch-hunting, lying, and so forth. I did not raise this matter lightly; I raised it only because I knew that unless I brought it before the Parliament no action whatsoever would be taken to rectify the sorry state of affairs. AfterI had mentioned the matter, the Prime Minister replied to me and pouted like a pouter-pigeon because I dared to impugn his actions on tbe committee that makes the award of the Commonwealth Literary Fund fellowships. His attitude clearly indicated that until action is forced upon this committee nothing will be done to investigate the method of awarding fellowships. Mr FR-AXCIS -The same method was followed during the regime of the Labour Government. later. The Prime Minister accused me of wanting a political test applied to the",83,Commonwealth Of Australia Repatriation General Hospital
204,Mr Keou (Yarra) [9.39],The,85,Commonwealth Of Australia Repatriation General Hospital
205,Mr Keon,"I shall deal with thatpersons who sought fellowships. He said that I had put forward the view that a political test instead of a literary test should be applied. I say unhesitatingly that the direct opposite is the truth. I want the works of writers to he judged on literary merit and not on political affiliation. I was protesting against political judgments. On no account do I want political bias to be shown in choosing the persons who are to enjoy the benefit of the Commonwealth's bounty. It has been my complaint, since this Government took office, that political bias has been exercised by the committees appointed to award these literary fellowships. Out of seven fellowships granted by this Government to persons who write novels-and I remind honourable members that the grants are not made on the works themselves but to the persons in order that they may be free, to write the works-fou r have been given to definite Communists, one to a man who may be a Communist and can be described as a doubtful quantity, and one to man who has associated with Communists in "" fellow travellers' "" organizations. That is not a bad record for the Communists. They have received four or five of the seven fellowships that have been granted by this Government. On those facts I am entitled to say that the Prime Minister has apparently asked honourable members to accept the fact that only Communist writers are so outstanding in their ability as to be entitled to Commonwealth fellowships. We have been asked by the Prime Minister to accept the fact that the literary ability of the rest of the Australian people who do not accept the Communist doctrines falls far .short of the literary ability of a small group of Communists. One, for sure, -and perhaps three, non-Communists have been awarded Commonwealth fellowships by this Government as against four known Communists. Does the Prime Minister invite honourable members to believe that in those awards that have been given to Comcircumstances the awards were made munists I shall answer some of the charges purely on literary merit? If he does, that bave been made against me since my then it is high time that he resigned statements on this matter first appeared from the advisory committee and allowed in the press. Of course these charges some one who is prepared to investigate were made mainly by members of the thoroughly this matter of the judgment Communist party who denied that they of literary ability and the award of Comwere Communists but were in receipt of monwealth fellowships to take his place. fellowships from the Commonwealth Mr Keon. Quite evidently, when the Prime Minister replied to my statements about the matter a few days ago, he invited honourable members to believe that the awards were made on literary merit. He said that it was nonsense to suggest that -leftists were exercising any undue influence in this matter, and he accused me of wanting a political test applied to those who sought the awards of fellowships. He said that I wanted a political test applied rather than a literary test. I inform the right honourable gentleman that I want the political test abolished, and I want these leftists to be tested purely on literary merit. I say that a literary test is not being applied at present in awarding the Commonwealth fellowships. I believe that the test applied is to ascertain whether an applicant for a fellowship is within the charmed circle of Communists or literary fellow-travellers. I am now speaking of those people who write novels and not of the writers of serious works, because quite obviously Communists have neither the intelligence nor the ability for tbe research necessary in the writing of serious and -worth-while books. The Prime Minister would have us believe that literary ability is confined to Communists and stooges and "" fellow-travellers "". The right honourable gentleman can believe that if he likes, and' his supporters can believe it ; but I certainly do not believe it, and I protest vigorously against the great number of Commonwealth fellowships that have fallen into the hands of Communists. The Government parties moved a motion of protest, quite unjustly, against the previous Labour Government's administration of this fund. I now ask honourable members on the Government side to force the Government's hand on this matter if the Prime Minister will not do anything himself. BeforeI try to prove the number of Literary Fund and had formerly been associated with tbe Communist party. The reaction of tbe Communist party to my statements was the usual squeal and smear campaign, but this time the squeal was several notes higher and the smear was many degrees wider because finally the Communists' handswere being plucked out of the taxpayers' pockets. I shall consider first Judah Waten. This man is a Russian who has received two grants from the Commonwealth Literary Fund, one to write a book and one to publish it . Mr Waten denied that he was at present a member of the Communist party but said that he had been a member of the Communist party in 1930 and that I had wrongly charged h i m with writin g a book which included certain blasphemous matter: charge h i m with writin g that matter; as honourable members w ill perceive when I read from my rough Hansard proof of the speech that I made about h i m in the Parliament. I saidTjct me quote some of the other activities of Mr Waten, who enjoys a grant of some £800 from the CommonwealthGovernment for the purpose of producing a literary work. One poem in a journal of which Mr Waten was the editor is entitled, "" Jesus Christ in an Ash Tray "". Another poem in this publication is so indecently blasphemous tliat 1 shall not read it at all. Honourable members w ill perceive that I did not say that Mr Waten wrote the poem. I said that he was responsible f b r its publication. I have the publication here. It is a magazine called Strife, and it is issued by the Communist party. The name of J . L . Waten ig shown on the first page as editor of the pnblication. The issue to which I refer honourable members is dated the 13th October, 1930, and the poem is ascribed to a person who writes under the Impious IX . I understand that Mr Brian Fitzpatrick is now: claiming credit for it . Apparently when this poem was published he was more unwilling to admit bis membership of the Communist party than he is now. If honourable members have any doubts about Mr Waten's Communist affiliations, let them read some of tbe articles in Strife. This is a sample of Mr Waten's own workWith telling strokes and penetrating analysis There cannot be the slightest doubt in the thecentral committee of the Communist party set forth the fundamental character . and. dynamics of the economic and political situation of Australia. Here is another sampleHere is a booklet that goes far towards exploding the fallacious blather of the Professors and Labour party apologists. The whole magazine reeks of communism, because, in fact, it is a Communist publication. Many of the articles in it were written by Mr Waten himself, thus showing his Communist bias. I warmed a little towards Mr Waten when I read an article in relation to the daily press in which he saidThe days and nights shriek and groan with the palpitating beat of the giant dope machines, foul, slimey octipl that suck and suck and grow fat on the brains and hearts of men. I did not I began to have a fellow feeling for him when he went on to sayIn their stead, they leave flabby, bloodless, putrifying pulps of psychophantic content, servile acquiescence and ""lily-livid inertia. So much for his views on that subject: I know that his answer is that he has since resigned from the Communist party and has not had anything further to do w it h it . Now let us consider that statement. Mr Waten is named in Mr. Justice Lowe's report on the Royal Commission of 1950 as a member of the Communist party. All my sources of information are freely available to the public, and I have always: carefully read Communist publicationsand have taken a note of whatever has interested me. The Melbourne Guardian of the 12th was in charge of the north-west Communist party news. In 1949, the same paper reported that he was a patron of' the Youth Actionf o r Peace Congress, together w i th D : IT. P r it t , the Dean of nom de plume Canterbury, Stanistreet, RT. S. Pritchard, and. W i l f r ed Burchett, of Red Korean fame, hardly fit associates foran exCommunist. On the 3rd December, 1950, he was reported to be on theHardy Defence Committee, together with Fitzpatrick, John Morrison, Lambert and Marshall. Lambert and Morrison have also received grants from the Commonwealth Literary Fund. Dozens of in stances of Mr Waten's activities are outlined in the Communist party newspapers.",85,Commonwealth Of Australia Repatriation General Hospital
206,"January, 1943, Reported That Mr Waten","mind of any reasonable person concerning the trueposition of this gentleman. Time is pressing, and therefore I shall have to skip some of the facts. However, I shall he glad to supply them to the Prime Minister if there should be any chance of his being moved in this matter at some future date. Most people know who Mr Hardy is and have heard about the book that he wrote. He went to London and wrote an article about the Realist Writers' Group that was published in the Daily Worker of that city last December. He stated that the group had been formed in 1944 and that most of its members were also members of the Communist party. The aim of the group was to study literature from the Marxist viewpoint. He commentedOne sure sign of political maturity of a ing information about Mr Palmer in the working class movement is that it produces a group of writers who work as part of the strugg.e for peace and socialism. Ihe Australian revolutionary movement has produced such a group. That referred to the Realist Writers Group. I have the names of some of its members. Fitzpatrick's publication of February, 1952, in an article by Mr Eric Lambert, who enjoys a government bounty in the form of a literary fellowship, the list includes, in addition to Frank Hardy, John Morrison, who has received two grants from the Commonwealth Literary Fund. IfI had sufficient time at my disposal, I should relate the Communist activities of Mr Morrison as reported in the Guardian. According to Mr Hardy, whose aim is to give the revoluntionary viewpoint to literature, the Realist Writers' Group was helped at its readings, talks and discussions by Vance and Nettie Palmer. That is a most significant fact. Mr Palmer is the chairman of the Commonwealth Literary Board, and his advice on the granting of awards is undoubtedly accepted by the other members of the board and by the members of the committee. helper was Frank Dalby Davison, a member of the Communist party, whose activities, as reported in the Communist press week by week, would fill half a page. Davison is' in receipt of a Commonwealth Literary Fund grant for the production of a book of short stories. I have that book here, but the information Mr Keon. printed at the front of the volume states that thirteen of the stories had been publisbed previously, and paid for, by the Bulletin and other journals. Thus, be was given £250 to enable him to produce two additional short stories in order to complete the volume. But of course leftist influence had nothing to do with that! That was purely coincidental, like the budget leakages! I refer now to the chairman of the Commonwealth Literary Fund Advisory Board. The Prime Minister said in this chamber on the 28th August, after I had mentioned the matter, that he thought Mr Palmer was a most estimable gentleman who had no leftist leanings and that I apparently was suffering from delusions. I have uncovered some extremely interestcourse of a brief examination of the Communist party's publications. Youth Voice, tbe official organ of the Eureka Youth League, reported that in June, 1946, Mr Vance Palmer was a patron of the league. No doubt he was accustomed According to Mr Brian to dine and talk at that time with the present Prime Minister, who was then the Leader of the Opposition. In August, 1946, Mr Palmer backed the Eureka Youth League's New Deal finance appeal. In August, 1947, he formally opened an art sale for the benefit of the Eureka Youth League delegates to a conference at Prague. On the 6th March, 1951, he was acting in the Hardy Defence League. All these facts have been reported in the Guardian and Youth Voice. On the 10th August, 1945, according to the Guardian, he was a speaker at the Communist Club, 218 Camberwell-road, Camberwell. On The 26th July, 1946, he wrote a letter to protest against the fact that the Soviet flag was not displayed on public buildFund Advisory ings. On the 6th August, 1948, he was the chairman of a committee that organized a fund to send Mr Counihan abroad. Mr Counihan was fonnd by the Another Victorian royal commission on communism to be a. Communist. On the 27th August, 1948, he issued a further appeal in the Guardian for donations for Mr Counihan to be sent to Europe on Communist party affairs. He is reported to have spoken, on the l l t h August, 1950, to a Readers and Writers Peace Committee and was active in organizing such a committee. I do not know whether only on the assumption that the officers Mr Palmer is a Communist or not, of the fund deliberately misled him. but that is a brief statement of Tbe circumstances that I shall discuss his activities.

I shall read the questions that were",87,Commonwealth Of Australia Repatriation General Hospital
207,Mr Wentworth,"Literary Fund Committee, and the answers that he gave to them. He was asked' 1. What fellowships, subsidies, guarantees and/or other assistance were granted by the fund to Marjorie Barnard? 2. In connection with what works or proposed or projected works and for what other purposes were such payments or guarantees made ? 3. What works have been published as a result of such payments and/or guarantees and by what publishers? 4. What works remain to be published us a result of such payments and/or guarantees, and under whose auspices are they expected to appear? Mr Chifley supplied the following answers:1. A fellowship of £200 covering a period of twelve months from 1st January, 1941. 2. An historical novel. 3. A study of Governor Macquarie and his times was produced in a limited edition in 1942 and a cheaper edition is now in course of publication by Melbourne University Press. The novel, under the title of To-morrow, is in course of publication by Georgian House, Melbourne. That occurred in 1946. Shortly afterwards the Melbourne University Press issued a cheap edition of Macquarie's World, which had been published earlier in a limited edition. In 1947, Georgian House published a novel entitled To-morrow and To-morrow, which was written, not by Miss Marjorie Barnard, but by Miss Barnard in collaboration with Miss Eldershaw, who had been a member of the Advisory Board from its inception, and, in fact, is still a member of it. The extraordinary thing is that, on the 29th May, 1947, Mr Chifley, in answer to another question upon notice, went back on his previous answer and saidThe Commonwealth Literary connected with the publication World. I have given a bald recital of the facts, but it is quite clear-is it not?-that the officers of the fund were trying to cover something up, and were misadvising the Prime Minister of tbe day. How is it that, when a fellowship is granted for an historical research work, a trashy, tripey novel, with a Marxist slant, appears in its place, and is not entered in the records of the fund, so that the then Prime Minister, when he was asked a question upon notice about it, gave to the House Sir. Wentworth. a misleading reply? How. is it that a fellowship is ' issued to Miss Marjorie Barnard, and then the work that is supposed to be subsidized is written, not by her, but by her in collaboration with a lady who is one of the five members of the Advisory Board? Obviously, the matter calls for an inquiry. Is it not quite obvious-and I am afraid that I . have to be in agreement with the honourable member for Yarra on this pointthat those people who have a leftist or a Marxist slant receive very easy and lenient treatment from the controllers of the fund? I contrast this position with the treatment that was accorded to another book on Macquarie by a man who has an anti-Communist slant. I refer to The Life of Macquarie, by MrM . H . Ellis, whose name, perhaps, is familiar to most honourable members. His work has real, historical merit. It was published eventually without any assistance from the fund, and received not only the Harbison-Higinbotham Eesearch Prize from the Melbourne University, but also as a result of the publication, the author was awarded a fellowship in the Royal Historical Society of Australia and the Royal Historical Society of England. The work had real scholarship, and won world-wide acclaim. Yet it was treated in the most shabby way by the controllers of the fund. Time will not permit me to discuss all the details of this matter this evening, although I have them available, and any honourable member who wishes to peruse the papers may do so. However, there is one matter which, in my opinion, is worth mentioning. I have not as yet formed any definite conclusion about it, but I believe it to be worthy Fund was not of investigation. The author of The of Macquarie's Life of Macquarie made a charge that Miss Marjorie Barnard had improper access to his manuscript, and had used it for the compilation of her own work. He made that statement in a letter which he wrote to the present Prime Minister some time ago. Let me quote his exact wordsThere was also some evidence integral in her book which suggests that she had been in possession, not only of the manuscript which she admits Mr Davison made available to her, but also of the one which is in the custody of the Advisory Board. J.t .is admitted that Mr Davison merit, but with an improper bias towards made the manuscript available to Miss the Communist party, supporters of the Barnard, .and it is worthy of note Communist -party, and adherents of the that her work was dedicated to Mr Communist party. In my opinion, that Da.vi.son, who has been named by the cha-r.ge is made out 100 peT cent, by the honourable member for Yarra as a mem-facts. Of that, I h a v e no doubt whatever. ber .of the Communist party. But the The next point is 'in relation to the book best piece of (evidence that has been by Miss Ma,rjorie Barnard, the sudden brought forward in support of this 'charge switch in May, which was not properly appears in Mr Elliste own memorandum, recorded in the public records of tbe fund, which reads as follows:There .are some curious coincidences between ently, on a work in which Miss Eldershaw the text of my manuscript and the text of Hiss had been a collaborator.

SoI did not have an oppornonsense that he has rehashed on five fellowships. Tbe primary point about the Commonwealth Literary Those whether a pers&n is a Communist, a be directed to the development of Australian literature. Let us take first things origin. The fellowships have helped first. The answer is to be found in the basic question-Can a person write or uot? If the answer be ""no "", the person concerned does not get a scholarship whether he is a Communist or anything else. There is no preference for persons of any ideology. When a debate on the same issue took place some"" time ago the arch hater of Communists in this country, Mr Scullin, said, "" The only test is whether they can write. I do not care how they vote or whether they vote."" That basis has been maintained. The fund has had the distinction of having former Prime Ministers and Prime Ministers at its head and has had writers of high reputation as its advisers. Can more be expected of a body that is seeking the best literature? If one were witch hunting, one would look for much more. The hard fact is that of 50 fellowships, three have been granted to suspected Communists. That is a fair average in the community whether one's head be buried in the sand or not. There are Communists in other avenues as well as in literature and because no test can determine whether or not they are Communists, three out of 50 is a fair average if , indeed, those three writers are Communists. Tbat has to be proved. It has not been shown, to be a fact. This tedious reading from one dead piece of writing or another is a well-known technique that Communists use for the purpose of adopting people. tually the Communists may adopt the honourable member for Mackellar. The fact that something is printed in a Communist publication does not make it gospe\ I prefer to believe the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), Mr twelve years' time the honourable member Scullin and the late Mr Chifley as to the integrity of the Commonwealth Literary Fund and the earnest wit»rs w o do tbeir 1-i best to give to Australian literature a chance to develop. tbe hard fact that has been presented to the committee is that three Communists have gained fellowships in 50 awards. During the war we did not have on the bookshelves one Australian book that we could show to our American friends. We had reprints Sir. Haylen. and not one of them was of Communistsuch writers as Mary Gilmore and Ernestine Hill. We have given a fellowship for a history of the Church of England. The Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) received a grant from the fund for writing about the Australians' black brothers, the aborigines. All the argument in the world will not make that man "" red "". It is time that all honourable members came to their senses. Three suspected Communists have been found by them.. Of 30 books sponsored by the fund, 28 have been best sellers ancl not one of them was written by a Communist. Where is the force of the argument that the writers of Australia, have succumbed to the blandishments of communism? To say that that is so is to perpetuate a contemptible, mean trick under privilege. There are no avowed Communists on the Advisory Board and certainly there are none on the Commonwealth Literary Fund, the leader of which is the Prime Minister. What great work has been done by the Commonwealth Literary Fund? The honourable member for Yarra has made an honourable apology concerning a later recipient from the fund, Judah Waten. He made an implication, but the Hansard record of his speech shows that we did not hear as clearly as we thought we did his reference to some of the writings that Waten had edited. . I am relieved that the name of a 'brilliant Evenwriter has been cleared. That man has said, "" Is it impossible ever to cease to be a Communist?"" He declared that for twelve years he had not been a Communist. We cannot say whether in for Mackellar will make the same claim, because the line between madness and sanity is as thin as a piece of paper. No case has been made out to show I repeat that that the Commonwealth Literary Fund or the Advisory Board is riddled with Communists or is handing out largesse to Communists. It is nonsensical to say so, and such fiddle faddle serves no purpose except to destroy Australian literature. The Prime Minister issued a statement on the matter in which he set out clearly that the Oouunonwealtii Literary Fund stands for the encouragement of Australian writers and has the machinery to do so. I sat with the people concerned, and I know that they do an honest job. I know that although there may be some who are suspected of strong leftist tendencies and who may be Communists, not one book that has been published, sponsored or put out as a reprint by this fund has had the faintest tinge of Communist propaganda. I submit that that is the true test of this fund. It has successfully forwarded the case of Australian literature. To muddy the stream with nonsense about people hiding behind the covers of books and coupling literature with communism, is fantastic. In the list of those to whom fellowships have been granted since 1940, there are such names as Stella Miles Franklin, Doris Boake Kerr, Ernestine Hill, Marjorie Clark, Marjorie Barnard, E. J. Brady, Boy Connolly, S. J. Baker, J. H . M. Abbott, Dame Mary Gilmore, J. S. MacDonald, Sydney Tomholt, Frank Beid, who wrote under the name of Bill Bowyang, Daisy Bates, Eric Muspratt and Boy Bridges. The Commonwealth Literary Fund has done magnificent work in publishing the national poetry and bringing to the notice of the Australian people and the English-sneaking world the work of men like Brian Vrepont. Dymphna Cusack is not a 'Communist. Her best-sellers owe their beginning to the fact that tbey received the support of tbe fund. Who would suggest that H . M. Green was a Communist? He spent tbe last twenty years -of his life preparing a vast compendium -of Australian literature. Lewis Lett, who gained a fellowship, wrote stories of Papua which are classics and hi? biography of the life of Sir Hubert Murray, the great Administrator of the Territory, is accepted as a standard work. Is he a Communist? K. Mackenzie, another writer wbo secured a fe^owship. was a soldier who wrote a brilliant story about the Cowra gaol break when the Japanese br^ke looje from their prisoner-of-war camp. As a war story, it is a fine piece of work. There was also J. K. Ewers, the celebrated We=tern Australian noet, -essayist, and litterateur, Judith Wright, Eric Lowe, another Kenneth MacKenzie, and Dal Stivens, who worked in the Department of Information under two governments. Then we come to Judah L. Waten, who was fair game for any one who was looking for Communists. Finally, we have Kylie Tennant, Victor Kennedy, and Xavier Herbert. Where are the seven Communists of whom we have been told ? The honourable member for Yarra could produce, with any assurance, only three, and he could not point to one item of Communist propaganda in any of the books they wrote. Seeing that the members of the committee formed, their judgments on the literary value of the works submitted, they did veiy well to include only three supposed or possible Communists in a list of 50 beneficiaries. The literature that has been sponsored by the Commonwealth is democratic and of high quality, without any smack of communism. That is a memorable achievement for a small committee, and it indicates that its members dedicated themselves conscientiously to their task. The rabble-rousing nonsense that we beard from the bonorable member for Mackellar, who devoted most of his time to attacking a woman, was a rat-nest of propaganda. We heard it all years ago, before the honourable member came into this Parliament, and it was refuted then. No ease was made out by the honourable member for Mackellar, nor by the honourable member for Yarra, who endeavoured to support his allegations with suggestions that have not been difficult to refute. Wide and windy statements about Communists are bad enough, but when statements of that kind are applied to literature, that starveling which needs nourishment but gets so little, an ill service is rendered to the community. I believe that my work with the committee was work well done, and I was sorry that I could not continue it. I have tbe greatest confidence in those with whom I worked. The Prime Minister of tbe day and the Leader of the Opposition spent hours with us maki^e sure that the awards should go to the right persons Is it likely that the leader of the Government, and the leader of the party that might become the government, wonld be parties to a policy of favouring Communist authors at the expense .pf other Australian writers ? It has certainly no£ been established that i^hpse who acbminister the f,und are afEected by coniminnisnitor ar.e sympathetic towards Communists. There is no .case to answer on -the charge ithat benefits haye been handed out £r.eely ,to Communists, -leftists or near-"" reds'"". The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr For about 50 years, it has been recogBowden) --Order. ! The honourable member's time has expired. I propose to speak on the subject of medical research. It is generally realized chat both physical and mental health depend in large measure on dental health. It is clear to all thinking people that this Goyernm.ent is concerned with the health of the Australian people, as has been proved by its ready acceptance of Hie national health plan, and its progressive implementation. better than cure, foi' which reason I welcome the provision of funds for medical research. I suggest that the Government should make a large contribution to dental schools -to enable them to conduct research into matters associated with dental health. Tn order to achieve dental health, three things a-re neoessa-ry. First, it is essential that the public be brought to understand fully the importance of dental health. achieved through the press, and by means of films, the radio, and education in the schools. must be made available to the people. It is of no use -to educate people on the stfbjeot of dental health unless dental serviuos .a-r-e -made available at small eost--to details of which I shall not refer to at Bhose who are unaMe to /pay f u l l sates for tihe treatment (they require. Thirdly, there is a ipossibility that the problem of dental decay .may be solved ;by lieseairch. Experiments are 'being conducted in the fluoridation of domestic water supplies for the .partial control of deivtal decay. This has 'been .described by ©r. N. E. Goldsworthy, the Director of Dental Research in Sydney, as the most important discovery in public health ; practice during <the last -25 years. According to Dir. Gcfldswortby, ,one ILM'omiuent member of rjie American Dental Association has described tie practice of water fluoridation as racking in importance with Jenner's small-pox vaccine, Pasteur's advancement of the microbial .theory of disease, the pasteurization ,of milk, immunization for diphtheria, and the administratioe of iodine : for [the prevention .of goitre. nized that a disease commonly known as mottled enamel, but described in medical terms as chronic endemic dental fluorosis, existed in certain areas in Italy, North Africa, and the United States of America, and it -was linked with the use by persons, from 'birth onwards^ of the water to be found in those areas. These mottled teeth, with their abnormal structure, did not show any greater tendency to deca,y, or to develop caries, as it is known in the dental profession, tha-n did other teeth. Eather, it has been Prevention is proved that the (presence of a trace of fluorine in domestic water supplies, through natural agencies, was associated with a lower incidence of caries. I have stressed tbe point that this is a trace element. Honourable members will appreciate the excellent work which trace elements are doing throughout the Commonwealth. If fluorine is present in domestic avater supplies in .a greater concentration than Imparts in 1,000,000 parts of water, it may produce mottled enamel This understanding can he in teeth, but as I have already men( tioned, evidence has been adduced that concentrations of fluorides in a 'Secondly, dental treatment smaller concentration than that have been associated with a reduction of the incidence of caries. This problem has been investigated in -v.arious ways, the this stage. The investigations have included field surveys with chemical analyses for the -fluorine content of caries-resistant and caries-susceptible teeth, ex-periments on animals, -the topical application of fluorides ito human -teeth, and investigation of the methods of providing these concentrations of fluorine in domestic water -supplies. Sueh investigations ha-v;e ibeen carried out in .oities overseas.

The results .obtained .show that there has been a decline of the incidence of caries in children's teeth by as much as .65 per cent. The mere topical application offluoridesto the teeth of children bas reduced the incidence of caries by one-third. I agree witb Pr, Goldsworthy that tljere are opposing views on the safety of the practice, because concentrations of more than 5.5 parts of fluorine to 1,000,000 parts of water may become poisonous. According to a report recently published in the Sydney Morning Herald, Dr. Goldsworthy statedThe occurrence in uncontrolled circumstances of toxic manifestations is no reason for denyiug the benefits of fluorine to very large numbers of urban people ^yllere engineers and chemists pan sec to it that thp fluorine content of which they receive repatriation beneof the water supply is maintained at a level below that which can cause any of thc recognized injuries. Fluoridation of water supplies can be carried out through the existing facilities for water purification. Honourable members will know that it is common practice to introduce chlorine into domestic water supplies, and, therefore, the introduction of the correct quantities of fluorine would present no great problem to engineers. I also agree with Dr. Goldsworthy's statement that experiments with water supplies should be undertaken throughout Australia, and that a caries survey should be linked with those experiments in order to gauge the effects of the experiments. 1 hope that the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) will use his influence to see that a proportion of the proposed vote for medical research shall be made available to the appropriate bodies for adequate experiments and research along the lines that I have suggested. If dental health can be achieved in Australia, it should be our aim to achieve it. Experiments in other parts of the world have shown that great progress has been made in this matter. ' I believe that the children of the future may reach manhood and womanhood with a full complement of teeth. At the present time many thousands, of young people are not able lo do go. For the benefit of those honourable members who have spoken to-night about the Commonwealth Literary Fund, I wish to make clear a point that does not seem to be generally understood. Of the 45 persons who have received fellowships from the fund, fifteen have been Communists or have had Communist tendencies. proceeding to discuss the Commonwealth Bank report and balance-sheets for the financial year which ended on the 30th June, 1951, I wish to say something in connection with the Repatriation Department, in order to supplement the remarks of the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Griffths). In common with the honourable member, I have found that in my electorate there are old "" diggers"" who are suffering from a number of disabilities due to war service and in respect fits. In addition to those disabilities they have contracted other illnesses which are not related to war causes and whicb debar tbem from receiving certain repatriation benefits. For instance, because those illnesses cannot be related to war causes they are denied treatment in repatriation hospitals. In my opinion the law could be more sympathetically administered in such cases, of which there are many. The report of the Commonwealth Bank, to which I have referred, contains the following passage, under the heading "" Profit and Loss Accounts "":The aggregate net profit of the Commonwealth Bank, including the Note Issue Department, and the Commonwealth Savings Bank, after making provision for contingencies was, in round figures, £7,306,000. This compares with £7,618.000 last year, a decrease of £312.000. Of the aggregate profit, £4,730,000 was paid to the Commonwealth Treasury (of which £3,394.000 went to Consolidated Eevenue and £1,338,000 to the National Debt Sinking Fund). The point that I wish to make is that during the current and the preceding sessional periods of this Parliament honourable members have claimed that the Oommonwealth Bank should be required to pay all the rates and taxes, including income tax, which the private banks must pay. If this report is examined it will be found that not only does the Commonwealth Bank pay such taxes, but that it also pays all its profits into Consolidated Revenue. In that way the",94,Commonwealth Of Australia Repatriation General Hospital
209,Mr Costa (Banks) [10.35],"Befor ewhole nation benefits from its operations. Instead of amending the Commonwealth Bank Act in order to place the bank in the same position as private banks, I suggest that the private banks should be required to do as the Commonwealth Bank does. During the financial year which ended on the 30th June, 1951, only three branches of the bank were opened. There are 431 branches distributed throughout the Commonwealth. In my opinion there should be many more. It is obvious from the distribution of branches throughout the Commonwealth that the bank is not being developed as it should be and that it is not making the same progress in this regard as it did in the early years of its operations. There are only 247 branches in New South Wales, 45 in Victoria, 63 in Queensland, sixteen in South Australia, 45 in Western Australia, six in Tasmania, two in the Northern Territory, and one' in tbe Australian Canital Territory. When one considers the number of suburbs there are in Canberra, it is obvious that there should be several other branches. In my electorate, which is one of the biggest Commonwealth electorates in the metropolitan area of Sydney, having an enrolment of 55,000 electors, there are only three branches of the Commonwealth Bank. Important suburbs, such as East Hills, Heme Bay and Padstowe, are without a branch of that institution. The Government should make every effort to see that these facilities shall be provided in such areas. I agree with the bonorable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) that interest rates are too high. The recent rise of interest rates has mcreased the cost of the construction of an average bouse by £350 and has increased tbe interest bill in respect of the National Debt by £30,000,000 per annum. Some years ago, the Commonwealth Bank was largely responsible for tbe reduction of interest rates to reasonable levels. During the last general election campaign, Labour party candidates promised that Labour, if returned to office, would immediately reduce interest rates. This Government has reversed that policy, and has increased those rates. I agree with the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Wight) that Mr Costa. although the States have majority representation on the Australian Loan Council, it is the duty of the Commonwealth to manage the raising of loans. But, in that respect, the Government has failed the country. Possibly, the reason why recem Commonwealth loans were not fully subscribed was that the interest rate offered was not sufficiently attractive. Generally speaking, however, wealthy interests in this country deliberately refused to invest in those loans in the hope that if they failed the Government would be induced to raise the rate to 5 per cent., as it has now done. withhold their labour, they are regarded as being on strike. Wealthy interests which, for purely selfish purposes, refuse to lend to the nation money that is required for the development of our resources are in the same category. Eeverting to the necessity to make available the facilities of the Commonwealth Bank in important centres of population, I point out that official post, offices, of which there are from 1,300 to 1,400 throughout Australia, are established in all towns with a population of over 2,000. At the same time, there are over 6,000 non-official post offices. I can see no reason why a branch of the Commonwealth Bank should not be established at least in every centre that has a population in excess of 2,000. of £68,615 is being allocated in respect of the World Health Organization, which is a part of tbe social and economic setup witliin the framework of the United Nations. I have been particularlyinterested in the reports that that organization issues from time to time with respect to the rehabilitation of persons who are handicapped physically. Although we are heading towards the establishment of a welfare State, that unfortunate section of the community seems to have been lost sight of. The condition of children who are physically handicapped and are unable to help themselves can be substantially improved through the provision of Government assistance and the exercise of public sympathy. I refer particularly to children",95,Commonwealth Of Australia Repatriation General Hospital

212,Mr Leslie (Mioore) [10.44],"A sumwho are afflicted with cerebral palsy aud are generally described as spastic children. Within recent years, the fact has come to be generally recognized that the problem of the treatment of 3pastic children, educationally and physically, cannot be undertaken as a part of the ordinary treatment children. It is a special problem, and voluntary organizations have been formed in each State for the purpose of dealing specifically with it. However, the Western Australian Government is the only government that has yet assumed a measure of responsibility for such children. At the request of the Spastic Welfare Association, that Government has provided a special school for the education of spastic children. Unfortunately, tbe medical profession is not very well informed about the treatment of cerebral palsy. But we know that the affliction is due to a disorder of the motor part of the brain. A spastic child is normal, intellectually, but lacks the power of expression ; and that power can be restored only by special education and physiotherapeutic treatment. Knowledge on the part of a spastic child that he, or she, possesses normal intellectual capacity but lacks the power of expression causes frustration. The victim is unable to give expression to thought and movement. However, modern experience has shown that spastic children need not be abandoned to utter helplessness. They can be enabled to become useful members of society and need not remain entirely dependent upon tbe charity of the community. Every person is entitled to the comforting thought that he is not dependent on others. helped. Provided treatment is commenced sufficiently early, they can be trained and treated to attain a measure of mental satisfaction that they are not useless pieces of driftwood in society. The United Nations organization has considered the rehabilitation of physically handicapped children, and has recommended exactly what is being done in Australia, that is, that special provision be made for the treatment of children affected by cerebral palsy, educationally, socially, and medically. I point out that what is being done in Australia is the. result of the spontaneous action of generous men and women. I understand that the New South Wales Government also provides educational assistance to the spastic centre at Mosman, in Sydney. The New South Wales Government is the only government in this country that has prescribed for crippled assumed direct responsibility for one section of the needed treatment. That assistance is still in the experimental stage; it does not meet the whole of the requirements of the situation. The World Health Organization has suggested a number of ways in which this problem could be tackled. The minutes of the meeting of that organization of the 26th May, 1952, contain this observationGenerally speaking, it is charitable work that is needed. The general tenor of the organization's report is that the interest of tbe public should be awakened and maintained, that charitable work should be encouraged, and that governmental assistance should be provided. There must be charitable work, official governmental recognition, and participation in the scheme by persons who are personally interested because their children are afflicted. It is to urge the Australian Government to accept a degree of responsibility for the treatment of spastic children that I have addressed myself to the proposed vote of £68,000 as a contribution to the World Health Organization. We can learn a lot from our participation in that organization. I do not for a moment say that the proposed expenditure is unjustified, or that it should be reduced. All these children can be Ear from it ! If possible, it should be increased. I point out, however, that charity begins at home. One of the main purposes of the World Health Organization is to provide technical and other assistance to the backward nations of the world. It is doing a wonderful job in this connection. AlthoughI think not very kindly of the entry of the United Nations into the task of maintaining world peace, I consider that it is achieving great influence in the economic field. The World Health Organization lays down very definitely that it will provide assistance to nations which are not so well equipped as is Australia. Its resolutions make no mention of the fact that some of -the facilities that it recommends should be provided in those countries are not provided in Australia on an official basis. I do not for a moment suggest that it is the responsibility of the Australian Government to provide clinics; but it is definitely this Government's responsibility to contribute towards their maintenance. I should like to see included in the future Estimates-it could be done this yeara special Commonwealth grant to each State for the treatment of spastic children. It is an enormous job. The unhesitating response of the public in every State to appeals for the treatment of spastic children should spur the Government to put its hand into this pie. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) cou'd tell the committee of the splendid response of the people of South Australia to appeals to assist spastic welfare organization in that State. Only last week an appeal in Victoria realized £42,000. I am associated with the movement in Western Australia. En less than twelve months we have raised £20,000 to assist spastic children. We have purchased a building for use as a clinic, and engaged a doctor. We are now training physiotherapists. Our organization is conducted on an entirely voluntary basis; no money is provided by the Western Australian Government. I think honourable members will agree that we cannot continue to maintain the clinic on an entirely voluntary basis. I hope that the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) will interest himself particularly in this special province. The crippled children do not present an insuperable problem. I am as crippled as any child could be, but that does not bar me from enjoying the respectability of earning my own living. I could mention the names of many people who, although physically handicapped, have found niches in the world for themselves. A crippled child can go to an ordinary school. Although possibly he cannot engage in the playing of cricket or football, he has a degree of capacity to help himself. But spastic children present a special problem. Intellectually, they have nothing whatsoever wrong with them. Although they may not be able to speak clearly,. they Mr Leslie. know what they want to say, and they can read. With the assistance of an electric machine, such children have attained a high degree of education. Some have attained the degree of Bachelor of Arts. A research clinic has been set up in England to train people to treat spastic children. Not very much is known about cerebral palsy. lt> addition to research into its treatment, there must also be rceareh into its causes. The number of spastic children is increasing as a result of the advance that has been made in medical science. Formerly many of them died at birth; now they are carried through from infancy to maturity. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN member's time has expired. Proposed votes agreed to.
