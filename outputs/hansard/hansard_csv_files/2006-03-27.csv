181,Mr Billson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:National Archives (Question No. 1511) Mr Melham asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 26 May 2005: (1) Did the National Archives of Australia seek advice from his department in relation to an application lodged by a Canberra-based historian in January 2004 for access to certain personal records created in 1973-1974 by Sir Paul Hasluck during his service as Governor General (National Archives series M1767). (2) What advice did his department provide to the National Archives in relation to this application and when did it provide it. (3) Did the National Archives of Australia or his department also seek advice from the Office of the Governor General in relation to the application. (4) Was the Governor General consulted at any time in relation to this matter. (5) Did the Governor General or his Office at any time recommend or suggest that access to Sir Paul Hasluck’s personal papers not be granted or otherwise be limited or deferred; if so, when and why. (1) The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet was asked by the National Archives of Australia (NAA) for advice on papers lodged with the NAA by Sir Paul Hasluck. The Department was not aware of the identity of the individual who requested access to those papers. (2) and (3) The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet advised the NAA on 25 November 2004 that it had consulted the Hon EG Whitlam AC QC and that, consistent with his views, the Department considered that two sentences in one document titled Adjustment of Ministry, October 1973 contained information the disclosure of which would be an unreasonable disclosure of the personal affairs of an individual. The Department also drew the NAA’s attention to two other documents in the papers ( Mr Whitlam Discusses Prospects, December 1973 and Mr Whitlam Looks Ahead, March 1974) that had been referred to it and suggested that the NAA consider whether certain deletions should be made to them. Finally, the Department advised the NAA that it had discussed the papers with the Official Secretary to the Governor General and it expected that the Official Secretary would be in touch with the NAA about them. A copy of the Department’s letter to the NAA was sent to the Official Secretary for his information. (4) I am advised by the Official Secretary that he discussed the principles surrounding the timing of the release of private papers of former governors-general with the Governor General. (5) The answer to part (5) of this Question has been provided in response to Question No. 1512 which the honourable member addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts.

186,Mr Billson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:a member of Australia’s defence forces; or an Australian merchant mariner; or a member of the Commonwealth or allied forces with qualifying service; or an allied mariner with qualifying service. To be eligible for the medallion a Commonwealth or allied veteran, mariner, widow or widower must live in Australia. Eligibility for the medallion is not limited to those who served overseas. To be eligible to receive the medallion, a person must have served during the period of hostilities for World War II, between 3 September 1939 and 29 October 1945. An Australian veteran must have rendered continuous full-time service as a member of Australia’s defence forces, or have been a merchant mariner, during the period of hostilities, regardless of the place of service. Commonwealth and allied veterans must have rendered qualifying service during the period of hostilities to be eligible for the medallion. This is consistent with current eligibility provisions for entitlements under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986. (2) No. (3) No. Religious Organisations: Funding (Question No. 1909) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 9 August 2005: (1) Is the Minister’s department providing any funds to organisations which require their employees to meet certain religious requirements (eg membership of a particular church or religious group) as a condition of their employment; if so, will the Minister identify the organisations. (2) Does the Minister’s department provide funds to any organisations for programs which include religious instructions, or faith-based counselling; if so, will the Minister identify the organisations. (3) Does the Minister’s department place any requirements on church and charitable organisations which receive funds from the department that the funds not be used for religious or evangelical purposes; if so, what are the guidelines or requirements. (4) How does the Minister’s department ensure that services and programs funded by the Government and delivered by church and charitable organisations are not used for religious or evangelical purposes. (1) (a) Chaplaincy Services The Department has contracts in place with the Anglican, Baptist, Catholic and Uniting Churches for the provision of chaplaincy services at former Repatriation General Hospitals. It is assumed that the chaplains meet certain religious requirements of the church that employs them. (b) Veterans Line. The Department has a contract with The Salvation Army (NSW) Property Trust to operate Veterans Line which is carried out by the Salvation Army 24 hour telephone counselling service, Salvo Care Line. The conditions of employment for employees of The Salvation Army are not known.",135,Questions In Writing
187,Mr Billson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(c) Veteran& Community Grants. The Department has provided funds under its Veteran& Community Grant program to religious bodies and is not aware of funds being approved for religious specific requirements. The conditions of employment for employees of these religious bodies are not known. Funds are available to community and veteran community organisations and groups that meet the program Guidelines. In 2004-05, one grant of $1 400 was approved to a religious organisation, the Morialta Uniting Church. Funds were to install a telephone in the workshop that was independent of the Church office to ensure prompt access to emergency services if needed. The target group for the project is primarily older veterans who participate in workshop activities, which include woodworking and some metalworking. (2) (a) Chaplaincy Services. The Department provides funding for the provision of pastoral care and commemorative activities at the former Repatriation General Hospitals, Greenslopes and Hollywood. The Department does not specifically fund religious instruction or faith based counselling. (b) Veterans Line. No. (c) Veteran and Community Grants. No. (3) (a) Chaplaincy Services. Chaplains provide ministry to the whole hospital community including facilitating pastoral care for persons who hold other than Christian beliefs and are funded on this basis. (b) Veterans Line. Yes. The contract with Salvo Care requires its employees to abide by the Australian Public Service Code of Conduct that requires employees to take reasonable steps to avoid any conflict of interest (real or apparent). (c) Veteran& Community Grants. Projects with a religious or evangelical purpose are not eligible for Veteran& Community (V&C) Grants funding under the program Guidelines. Successful V&C Grants applicants enter into a grant agreement that clearly states the purpose for which the grant funding must be used. (4) (a) Chaplaincy Services. The funding is for the provision of pastoral care to the sick and the commemoration of events significant to the veteran community. Within that context, no constraints are placed upon those delivering the care. (b) Veterans Line. The Department commissions reports and regularly reviews the service provider to monitor the quality of the service and ensure it is consistent with the contract. (c) Veteran and Community Grants. Under the grant agreement, the grant recipient is required to acquit the grant to show that the funds were used for the approved and agreed purposes. Chaplaincy Services (Question No. 1929) Mr Georganas asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 9 August 2005: (1) Can she confirm that Federal funding for chaplaincy services at repatriation hospitals has been cut. (2) What sum was allocated for transitional funding of these services for 2005-2006. (3) What sum was provided for this service in 2004-2005. (4) How many veterans or veterans’ family members used the chaplaincy services provided through repatriation hospitals in (a) 2002-2003, (b) 2003-2004, and (c) 2004-2005. (1) Federal funding of chaplaincy services at Repatriation Hospitals has not been cut. (2) The amount specifically identified for funding of chaplaincy/pastoral care services at former Repatriation Hospitals in 2005–06 is $771 390 (excluding GST). (3) The amount specifically identified for funding chaplaincy/pastoral care services at former Repatriation Hospitals in 2004–05 was $755 125 (excluding GST). (4) Funding for chaplaincy services is provided on the basis that it is of value to the veteran community. Reports are received on specific commemorative activity undertaken by chaplains under these arrangements. However, there is no accurate measure of the chaplains' interaction with veteran patients at former Repatriation Hospitals, as there are obvious sensitivities about the collection of such information. Recent inaccurate reports that the Department was reducing funding for chaplaincy services at Daw Park attracted strong representations from Ex-Service Organisations that attest to the significance that the veteran community places on the availability of these services. Commonwealth Property (Question No. 2011) Mr Bowen asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 10 August 2005: (1) What is name and address of each vacant property under the control of the department and each agency in the Minister’s portfolio (ie properties not actively used by the agency and not leased out).

When respondents are discharged or have their employment terminated, Defence has no further jurisdiction and cannot pursue complaints any further. When a complainant leaves Defence prior to the finalisation of a complaint, the process can continue if the respondent is still a Defence member. There is a higher proportion of sexual offences that have not been substantiated than for other categories. This is mainly because they are criminal offences for which, in many cases, the civilian police have found insufficient evidence to prosecute. The honourable member should note that reasons for the increased reporting include: increased awareness of what constitutes unacceptable behaviour; mandatory training in 2003-04 and 2004-05 emphasised the processes for making and managing complaints; greater confidence that issues will be addressed by management; Services have increased efforts to encourage units to submit reports; and increased culture of reporting in the Australian Defence Force. Australian War Memorial: London (Question No. 2760) Mr Hayes asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 1 December 2005: (1) What sum did the Government pay for the design and construction of the Australian War Memorial in Hyde Park, London. (2) Does the Government pay for, or contribute, the upkeep of the memorial; if so, what sum was spent on its upkeep in 2004-2005. (3) Is it the case that the memorial recognises only one Australian Prime Minister; if so, why; if not, will she list each of the Australian wartime leaders recognised by the memorial. (4) What assessment criteria did the Office of Australian War Graves use to determine which Australian wartime leaders would appear on the memorial and did she, or her office, have any involvement in the development of the assessment criteria. (1) $9 104 000 (2) The memorial was fully maintained under warranty for 12 months from November 2003. From November 2004 to June 2005 $19 000 was expended. (3) The Memorial does not specifically recognise any Prime Ministers. It comprises a long curving wall set with 24,000 place names recording the home towns of Australian men and women who served during the two world wars. Superimposed on these place names are 47 battle sites, representing theatres of war where Australians served. It also features the three Service insignia – Navy, Army and Air Force– and the Australian Commonwealth Coat of Arm as well as the quotation “Whatever burden you are to carry, we also will shoulder that burden” by the wartime Prime Minister Robert Menzies is inscribed on the Memorial. ’ (4) The OAWG sought a quote that encapsulated the Memorial’s aim: to commemorate those Australians who served alongside Britons in the two world wars. The quotation “Whatever burden you are to carry, we also will shoulder that burden” by Prime Minister Menzies was determined to be the most suitable. The Memorial was completed before the Hon De-Anne Kelly MP was appointed Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. Tertiary Legal Education Services (Question No. 2790) (1) When will the current contract for the provision of tertiary legal education services for military legal officers expire. (2) Has the request for tender process for a provider of tertiary legal education services for military legal officers commenced; if so, when. (3) When is the tender process expected to conclude. (4) Can the Minister confirm that a new contract for the provision of tertiary legal education services for military legal officers will be in place before the expiration of the current contract. (1) The previous contract for the provision of tertiary legal education services for Australian Defence Force (ADF) Legal Officers between the Commonwealth and the University of Melbourne expired on 31 December 2005. (2) The request for tender for the provision of legal education services was issued on 30 April 2005 with an original deadline for tender submission of 30 May 2005. Following receipt of written requests for deadline extension from two prospective tenderers (one of which was the then contract holder The University of Melbourne), the deadline was extended to 1 August 2005. (3) The tender process has concluded. (4) A contract for the provision of tertiary legal education services for ADF Legal Officers between the Commonwealth and The Australian National University was executed on 13 January 2006. The short break in contract continuity over the Christmas period has not affected the provision of tertiary legal services to ADF officers. The Australian National University is scheduled to offer the first of the core military legal education subjects in May 2006. In accordance with the transition arrangements negotiated by Defence, some students will continue to undertake the study of elective subjects at the University of Melbourne throughout 2006.",166,Questions In Writing

(3) Does the lack of a concise statement detailing the roles and responsibilities of the ADF and the State/Territory Coroners in respect of the post-mortem handling of members of the ADF who die whilst in service place undue pressure on ADF commanders in terms of their responsibilities in the handling of deceased members; if not, can the Minister explain why not. (4) Can the Minister confirm that the respective Defence Instructions pertaining to the post-mortem handling of members of the ADF who die whilst in service (a) does not adequately state the roles and responsibilities of the ADF and the State/Territory Coroners in those circumstances and (b) does not carry the legislative authority to demand compliance with the guidelines contained therein. (5) Can the Minister confirm that the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into the effectiveness of Australia’s military justice system confirmed that State and Territory Coroners retain the primary responsibility to investigate deaths in the ADF. (6) Can the Minister confirm that the primacy of the State or Territory Coroners in respect of the investigation of deaths in the ADF is not currently widely promulgated throughout the ADF. (7) Will Memoranda of Understanding clarify the position and provide for wide promulgation of the primacy of State or Territory Coroners in respect of the investigation of deaths in the ADF; if not, can the Minister explain why not. (1) Yes. However, Defence and the Coroners have been engaged in extensive consultations and it is anticipated that appropriate arrangements will be finalised in 2006. (2) No, Defence is not aware of such a document. (3) No. Within Defence, Defence Instruction (General) Personnel 20-6 “Deaths within and outside Australia of Australian Defence personnel” and Australian Defence Force (ADF) Publication 202 “Administrative Inquiries Manual” provide information and advice on the management of these matters. Further, the roles and responsibilities of the ADF and the State/Territory coroners have been the subject of ongoing discussions and exercises. (4) (a) The Administrative Inquiries Manual and the Defence Instruction must be read with the applicable Defence legislation, including a Ministerial direction issued by the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence on 5 May 2004. Together, these documents set out the roles and responsibilities of the ADF and State/Territory Coroners where a member of the ADF dies while in service. The Defence Instruction will be reviewed, with some minor amendments expected, to improve consistency with the Ministerial Direction. (b) Defence Instructions are general orders for the purposes of section 29 of the Defence Force Discipline Act (1988). Members of the ADF may be subject to disciplinary action under the Act for a failure to comply with any mandatory terms. (5) Yes.",169,Questions In Writing

(2) Is he aware that Mr Nowak observed a consistent and systematic pattern of torture, applied in particular to ethnic minorities, such as Tibetans and Uighurs, political dissidents, human rights defenders and members of religious minorities. (3) Is he aware that Mr Nowak observed that forms of torture used against detainees included beatings, use of electric shock batons, cigarette burns, hooding/blindfolding, guard-instructed or permitted beatings by fellow prisoners, use of handcuffs or ankle fetters for extended periods (including in solitary confinement or secure holding areas) and submersion in pits of water or sewage. (4) What is his response to the Special Rapporteur’s conclusion that (a) the practice of torture, though on the decline, remains widespread in China and (b) combating torture in China is impeded by the absence of essential procedural safeguards necessary to make its prohibition effective, and particularly the absence of an independent judiciary. (5) Has the Government raised the issue of torture in China, particularly in Tibet and Sinkiang, at the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue; if so, what was the response; if not, why not. (6) What steps will he take to raise the issue of torture in China with the Chinese Government. (7) How effective is the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue as a means of addressing the issue of human rights in China in general and the continuing use of torture in particular. (8) Will he raise the issue of torture as documented in the Special Rapporteur’s report directly with Chinese Ministers at his next meeting with them; if not, why not. (1) No. I understand the report will be submitted to the 62nd session of the Commission on Human Rights around March 2006. I have seen the Special Rapporteur’s press release of 2 December 2005, which provides an overview of the visit. (2) I am aware from the press release that the Special Rapporteur said that his predecessors received reports of a pattern of torture of this nature. (3) I am aware from the press release that the Special Rapporteur said that these methods of torture had been and continue to be documented by international human rights organisations. On the basis of the information he received during his mission, the Special Rapporteur confirmed that many of these methods have been used in China. (4) The Government has no reason to doubt findings a) and b) in the Special Rapporteur’s press release. The Government will study the report when it is released. (5) Yes, Australia has consistently raised the issue of torture in China, including at the most recent Australia China Human Rights dialogue, last held in Beijing in June 2005. The Chinese Government has acknowledged that although torture is illegal under Chinese law, it remains a problem in China. The Chinese Government has said that it is making efforts to address this problem. (6) The Government will continue to raise these and other human rights concerns with the Chinese Government at a senior level. (7) The Government believes that engaging the Chinese authorities in a continuing process of dialogue, combined with a Human Rights Technical Cooperation program, is the most effective and practical way of achieving tangible improvements in China’s human rights performance in the long term.

216,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:ernment outside the dialogue context, including during high-level visits and through our Embassy in Beijing. The Human Rights Dialogue provides an opportunity to raise general human rights issues as well as individual cases of concern. It enables us to conduct frank and constructive discussion on all areas of concern, including the treatment of political prisoners; rights of assembly, association and expression; torture; the death penalty; re-education through labour; ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang; North Korean border crossers and workers rights. The human rights dialogue is underpinned by a human rights technical cooperation program. This program aims to assist in the implementation of systemic reforms that will help strengthen the administration, promotion and protection of human rights in China. Assistance is provided in three main areas: legal reform; women’s and children’s rights; and ethnic and minority rights. The program has achieved outcomes in a range of areas, for example helping address women’s rights and domestic violence in ethnic minority areas; training prison officers to advance protection of prisoners’ rights; and in the operational protection of human rights by addressing prosecution procedures and practices, and the rules of criminal evidence. The Government has consistently raised the issue of torture with the Chinese Government in the Human Rights Dialogue since it began in 1997. International pressure has contributed to China taking some steps to acknowledge and address the problem of torture in China, including by allowing the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture to visit. (8) The Government will consider the report of the Special Rapporteur when it becomes available. On the basis of the report, the Government will then decide what response is required.

(6) Has he informed the Cambodian Government that Australian aid to Cambodia may be affected if the political and human rights situation in that country does not improve; if so, when and what was the response; if not, why not and when will he do so. (1) Yes. (2) Australia took a leading role in the Paris Peace Process, and continues to take its obligations as a signatory to the 1991 Agreements, and commitment to rebuilding Cambodia, seriously.",173,Questions In Writing
217,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Australia is continuing to work with Cambodia to help it create the political, economic and social conditions conducive to an independent, self-sufficient and democratic society. (3) Yes. The Australian Ambassador in Phnom Penh has raised the Australian Government’s concerns at senior levels in the Cambodian Government on a regular basis. Sam Rainsy and Cheam Channy have received Royal pardons and Sam Rainsy returned to Cambodia on 10 February 2006. (4) The Australian Government did not remain silent. (5) In 2005-06, total Australian aid flows to Cambodia are estimated to total $42.7 million. The Australia-Cambodia Development Cooperation Strategy 2003-2006 focuses on increasing productivity and incomes of the rural poor, strengthening the rule of law and reducing the vulnerability of the poor. Information about Australian aid to Cambodia can be found on AusAID’s internet site (http://www.ausaid.gov.au).

Muammar Qaddafi or the 1969 revolution that brought him to power. (4) Since the restoration of diplomatic relations between Australia and Libya in 2002, how many times and on what occasions has he communicated Australia’s concerns about human rights violations in Libya to the Libyan Government. (1) and (3) Yes. (2) I note the prolonged imprisonment of Mr al-Jamhi and have requested that our post in Cairo, accredited to Libya, seek more information on the case.

218,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) Is he aware of reports that economic and political disturbances in China are becoming more frequent and more intense and can he say what implications this has for Australia’s political and economic relations with China. (5) What is the Government’s response to the public statement by a group of 50 Chinese intellectuals arguing that only progress towards democracy in China can prevent such incidents from taking place. (1) Yes. (2) I understand that there were violent clashes between villagers and police in relation to a long running dispute over land requisition and compensation. At some point police fired shots on villagers. There are conflicting reports of the number of people killed and injured. Chinese media have reported that three people were killed and eight injured.

(3) No. My department is monitoring the case. Details are still unclear. I have instructed our Embassy in Beijing to raise the case with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (4) Yes. I am aware of reports of increasing economic and political disturbances in China. This is not surprising in a country undergoing a major socioeconomic transformation. Australia will continue to pursue its foreign policy interests with China, using a range of consultative mechanisms to address concerns. (5) The Government has noted this statement. Australia encourages China to guarantee the rights of association and assembly and the right to peaceful protest. Australia also encourages China to recognise that allowing its people to express grievances, including against government policy, promotes long-term social stability.

ACCI during the same period. The reasons for these payments were for the same purpose as stated in the ACCI comments. The amounts paid to the two organisations varied between financial years only due to the timing of invoices received from those organisations and their subsequent payment. Project Genesis (Question No. 2983) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 7 February 2006: (1) In respect to the establishment of Project Genesis, when did Airservices Australia and the Australian Defence Force (ADF) agree that they should seek to integrate air traffic management systems, Air Traffic Control (ATC) training and resource planning. (2) What resources have been allocated by (a) Airservices Australia and (b) the ADF to the project. (3) Have timelines been established for the integration of (a) Perth RAAF Approach Service and the Perth Terminal Control Unit and (b) the RAAF Tindal and Darwin Approach services; if so what are the details. (4) What other single airspace operations are being considered. (5) What are the expected savings for the ADF from Airservices Australia’s approach consolidation, including (a) capital expenditure, (b) joint training, (c) workforce planning, and (d) maintenance. (1) An Integrated Operating Concept (IOC), which details a joint vision for the future of Air Traffic Management in Australia, was signed by Defence and Airservices Australia in May 2005. Project Genesis was established in December 2005 as an outcome of the IOC to assess and manage reform proposals that contribute to the strategic vision of a single national system for air traffic management in Australia. (2) (a) Airservices Australia has allocated three staff to work on Project Genesis. Additional staff will provide support to the joint working groups on a non-permanent basis. (b) The ADF has appointed two officers to work on Project Genesis. Additional ADF staff will provide support to the joint working groups on a non-permanent basis. (3) (a) The original timeline for relocating RAAF Pearce radar services into the Airservices Australia Perth Terminal Control Unit was based on a joint feasibility study that indicated the relocation could be completed by the end of March 2006. This timeline was agreed by the CEO of Airservices Australia and the Deputy Chief of Air Force, but has since been extended to early June 2006 (due to Defence training requirements). (b) The relocation of Darwin and Tindal Approach services into the Airservices Brisbane Centre is tentatively planned for completion by end of 2006; however engineering assessments and a review of the business case may change this timeline. Project Genesis will submit a proposal and business case to CEO Airservices and Deputy Chief of Air Force for their consideration by mid-April 2006. The project delivery date will then be formalised and approved before further progression of this initiative. (4) Project Genesis will identify areas where changes in airspace management or the provision of air traffic management services will produce operational and economic benefits for the ADF, Airservices Australia, the civil aviation industry and national security. In addition, airspace initiatives such as flexible use of airspace and special use airspace are being jointly pursued outside Project Genesis. (5) The primary focus of Project Genesis is the delivery of a whole-of-government system for air traffic management in Australia that enhances national security. Closer relations between the ADF and Airservices Australia, including possible resource savings, will be an indirect consequence of developing improved business.

(4) No. Medibank Private (Question No. 3025) Mrs Elliot asked the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Administration, in writing, on 13 February 2006: (1) Why was the Medibank Private office at Tweed Heads, NSW, closed in December 2005 and relocated to Elanora, QLD. (2) What statistics, if any, were used to justify the decision to close the Tweed Heads office. (3) How many customers used the Medibank Private office in (a) Tweed Heads, NSW, (b) Lismore, NSW, (c) Broadbeach, Qld, (d) Southport, Qld, (e) Helensvale, Qld, (f) Loganholme, Qld, and (g) Upper Mt Gravatt, Qld, during 2005. (4) How many customers are expected to use the Elanora Medibank office in 2006. (5) Was any form of customer impact assessment done prior to the closure of the Tweed Heads office; if not, why not. (6) Was the option of opening a sub-branch at Tweed Heads within another business considered as a cost saving measure; if not, why not. (7) Were Tweed Heads customers informed about the closure of the Tweed Heads Office; if so, how and when, if not, why not. (8) Is Medibank Private currently engaged in any sponsorship arrangements; if so, what are the details of each sponsorship recipient and what sum has it received. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Medibank Private Limited (Medibank) advises that the decision to relocate the Tweed Heads retail centre to Elanora on 16 December 2005 was a business decision of the Medibank Board based on the advice of senior management. (2) Medibank advises that prior to its decision to relocate the Tweed Heads retail centre, Medibank conducted a review of the centre which showed that: customer volumes were low and declining; on average, Tweed Heads was processing 40-50% less than other retail centres; and new membership sales were negligible. Medibank advises that it regularly reviews its retail centre network to ensure that resources and capital are invested into the most effective and responsible retail centre network for members.",181,Questions In Writing

(4) Medibank advises that as it operates in a competitive industry, providing detailed customer information would be prejudicial to its commercial interests. However, when deciding on locations for retail centres, ensuring member access and therefore maximising the efficiency of the network, are paramount in the considerations. (5) Medibank advises that it carefully considered the needs of Tweed Heads residents prior to deciding to relocate the retail centre. Taking into account Medibank’s review of the Tweed Heads retail centre (answer 2 above refers), a number of sites were considered for the new location before The Pines Shopping Centre at Elanora was selected. Factors in favour of Elanora included its proximity to major roads and transport links, and the location of a Medicare outlet at the shopping centre. (6) Medibank advises that it does operate off-line agencies in some locations. However, as the agencies do not have access to Medibank systems, the services offered are restricted. Given that the nearby Elanora branch (12km away) would be offering the full range of services and serves the same catchment area, the opening of an off-line agency was not deemed to be an efficient use of member contributions. (7) Medibank advises that in response to the decision to relocate the Tweed Heads retail centre to Elanora, Medibank undertook an extensive member information campaign which included: 3,915 letters advising of the change were sent to area members likely to be affected and informing of alternatives to the in-store services; posters advertising the change were posted one week before closure of the retail centre. Difficulties in precisely identifying the date of opening at Elanora prevented a longer poster campaign; and press advertisements advising of the Elanora location were run in the Gold Coast Bulletin in the weeks following the move. (8) Medibank Private is currently engaged in sponsorship arrangements as listed below. Medibank advises that as it operates in a competitive industry providing detailed financial information on these sponsorships would be prejudicial to its commercial interests.

(2) In respect of each project or program referred to in (1), (a) what is its name, (b) who operates it, (c) what are its aims and objectives, (d) what funding has it received each financial year since 1996 and (e) in what year did Commonwealth funding commence and cease (if applicable). (3) What grants and benefits have been provided to individuals, businesses and organisations by the Minister’s department in the electoral division of (a) Richmond and (b) Page for each financial year since 1996. as follows: (1) to (3) The legislation establishing every Australian Government programme is allocated to particular ministers under the Administrative Arrangements Order. Descriptions of programmes are available in various publicly available documents. Providing details of the benefits and grants provided under those programmes would involve an unreasonable diversion of resources and in some cases, may breach the privacy rights of the individuals who received benefits under various programmes. Adelaide Airport (Question No. 3049) Mr Georganas asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 14 February 2006: (1) Will he consider expanding the Airport Noise Insulation Program to residents living in (a) Western Parade, (b) Press Road, (c) Lyons Street, (d) Raws Road, (e) James Avenue, (f) Clivan Street, (g) Marles Court, (h) Cleo Court, and (i) Clifford Street, Brooklyn Park. (2) Will he explain why residents living further from the airport are insulated and those living immediately next to it are not. (3) Will he request that independent noise testing be conducted on the streets in part (1) and that the results of the testing be publicly released. (4) Will he meet with residents in the streets in part (1) and listen to their concerns directly. (1) The sole criterion for eligibility for insulation of residential properties under the Adelaide Airport Noise Insulation Program (AANIP) is whether they are within the 30-noise exposure contour, as measured under the Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF) system. None of the residences referred to are located within the 30-noise exposure contour and therefore are not eligible for insulation. Residents at these locations are being treated no differently to many other residents located close to the boundaries. It would be inequitable to other similarly placed residents to make an exception. (2) Eligibility for inclusion under the Program is based on the ANEF system as updated by the annual Australian Noise Exposure Index (ANEI) maps. The ANEF system takes into account the numbers and types of aircraft, their flight paths and noise characteristics and the time of day of their operation. The ANEF system does not reflect a property’s proximity to the airport boundary, but its proximity to the flight paths. Residents within the 30-noise exposure contour are affected worse by aircraft noise and it is these residents that have been targeted by the AANIP program.",183,Questions In Writing

230,Mr Truss,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) The ANEI maps used by the AANIP are created independently from the AANIP program and are already available publicly from Airservices Australia. The ANEI maps are prepared using actual flight tracks for aircraft operating during the 12 month period as recorded in Airservices Australia’s Noise and Flightpath Monitoring System. (4) I acknowledge that residents who live close to the airport itself, while not directly under the flight paths, can be impacted by aircraft noise and am sensitive to their concerns. For a program such as the AANIP however, a boundary must be drawn somewhere and applied fairly and consistently. I am not able to offer these residents special consideration. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 3060) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 14 February 2006: (1) Did he see the report titled ‘Baggage blues just a case of peak-hour pile-up’ in the Sydney Morning Herald on 9 February 2006. (2) In respect of the remark attributed to Mr Max Moore-Wilton concerning the curfew prohibiting most aircraft using the airport between 11pm and 6am which, he said, “caused planes to bank up early in the morning, ‘but we’re talking to the Federal Government about that…if I had my druthers, we’d like to have no curfew at all’’’, will he guarantee that both the curfew and the 80 movements per hour cap will remain in place at Sydney airport; if not, why not.
