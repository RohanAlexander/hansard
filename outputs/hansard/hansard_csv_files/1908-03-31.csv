Reports received by Mr Mauger (the .Postmaster-General) from the Deputy Postmaster General of South Australia with reference to the pillar clearance work of the motor car. service in Adelaide, show that the recent breakdowns have not been continued, and that there is a prospect of the smooth working of the. new cars in the near future.

I ask that question because I have received a letter which contains a recommendation that a certain telephone should be constructed. The letter says that tbe Postmaster-General is satisfied that the telephone is necessary, but that the matter has been referred to the Secretary of the Department for advice on financial matters in connection therewith. I should like to ask the Prime Minister, therefore, whether the scope of the inquiry w ill be extended so as to include fhe 'relations between the Department and the Treasury? each year's Estimates are prepared is fairly well known; and the manner in which those Estimates are dealt with afterwards by this House is thoroughly well known. Certain sums are voted for certain purposes. If , however, the demands for new services during the twelve months go up by leaps and bounds, far surpassing anything anticipated when the Estimates were prepared-so that if it was estimated that there would be a demand for 5,000 telephones there is actually a demand for 20,000-the amount of money available is of course far short of what is required. that has been experienced over and over again during the past seven years to my knowledge. member knows that the demand for new -services during the last twelve months has -greatly exceeded what could have been -foreseen when the Estimates were prepared, even in the light of our experience <of previous years. duced the toll system before they were ready for it. toll system would be found to be so horribly unpopular that possibly our calculations were affected by that prophecy when estimating the number of people who would take advantage of it.

ON PROCEDURE.

I desire to know whether, when this Committee has devised or discovered means of procedure, it is the intention of the Prime Minister to introduce legislation, and if so, whether in that case the charges placed before this House by the honourable member for Lang, and the honourable member for Hunter will be immediately investigated ? to-night' of the members the Government propose to appoint on the Committee.

61,Mr Speaker,"If only the documentexpended at the end of any.given month, is nevertheless required for and appropriated to the public puiposes of the Commonwealth, and is therefore not in any sense "" surplus revenue.'! ThisB ill , after providing that the temporary clauses shall cease to operate, substitutes parliamentary provisions for the same .purpose and enables the Commonwealth at any time to withdraw from the Consolidated Revem:e and pay to Trust Account moneys which have been appropriated by the Parliament for any tpecial purpose. The Bill does not, of course, affect the operation of section eighty-seven (the Braddon Clause); but, while the Commonwealth remains during the currency of the Braddon Clause under ah obligation to return to the States three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue, it will have power to retain anything over and above that amount which it requires and has appropriated ' for Commonwealth expenditure. The Bill makes no radical alteration in the method of crediting revenue and debiting expenditure. It , however, makes provision for certain minor adjustments as to which the terms of the Constitution itself were not sufficiently explicit, but as to the justice of which there can be .no dispute. For instance, there is a definition of New Revenue. Revenue is revenue which is credited to the States on a population basis. Amounts were received from time to time by the Treasury which, although received in a particular State, could not by reason of their nature be credited to such State. Again, the Commonwealth earns interest on money in its hands in London. lected in any State, and does not belong to any State. It has been divided on a. population basis. The expenditure for the production of Gazettes and Federal parliamentary reports is borne on a' population basis; the proceeds of sale, being practically a reimbursement of that expenditure, are also distributed on a population basis without respect to the State in which they are received. ceived for rebates made by shipping companies in respect of freight from Great Britain to Australia. It is practically impossible to trace the items on which the freight of the various shipments were originally charged, and it has been the practice to distribute such amounts on a population basis. part of the revenue received by the new Commonwealth Departments, which really do not appertain to any particular State, is being distributed on a population basis; and this Bill lays down definite rules in accordance with which such amounts are to be credited. It has been found, however, that any precise rule which can be laid down for this purpose will cause some anomalies; and tlierefore two provisos have been inserted to give a measure of elasticity to the system, and to' enable the Treasurer to credit on a population basis any items of revenue which obviously, from tlieir nature, should be so distributed, and, on the otlier hand, to credit to a particular State, any items of revenue which, from their nature, obviously ought to be so credited. Sir William Lyne. The necessity for this B ill w ill, I am sure, appeal to honourable members. Since the inception of Federationwe have every year handed over to the Treasurers of the States a sum considerably in excess of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled under the Constitution. I propose to put before honourable members some figures which w ill clearly show what we have done in that respect. Sir JOH N FORREST -Every one is familiar with them. Sir WILLIAM . LYNE The honourable member may be familiar with the amounts, but there are others who are not. The following sums have been returned to the States in excess of the ' three-fourths to which they were .entitled:-Fo r the half year ended 30th June, 1901, £ 5 7 7 , 8 4 5 ; in 1901 -2, £ 8 8 8 , 7 4 1 ; 1902-3, £ 1 , 1 4 5 , 2 3 4 ; i 9 3 4, £ 7 4 5 , 3 3 ; '904-5, ; £ 7 3 5 , 2 8 6 ; 0 2 i 9 ° 5 °, £ 8 2 9 , 9 1 0 ; 1906-7,"" £ 8 0 5 , 7 6 6 . The total amount so paid for the six years was £ 5 > 7 > "" 4 2 8 ' not apply to all the States. Queensland, for instance, has been receiving less than her three-fourths. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I am aware of that. I have quoted these figures in .order to show first of all that the Commonwealth This interest is not colhas returned to the States revenue that which rightly'belonged to us, and which could have been utilized in carrying out various works, for which a demand has been made on many occasions. In the second place, the figures show that the accusation of extravagance made againsb us by representatives of the States, and reConsiderable amounts have been repeated over and over again with a desire to injure the Commonwealth, is absolutely without foundation. feature of the situation is that while some In practice, the greater of the States have had returned to them more than their three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue, others have had paid to them less than the three-fourths. Sir WILLIAM LYNE We have made a distribution according to law, so that neither the Government as a whole,nor the Treasurer, can be held blameable in that regard. The result of the system hitherto adopted has been ' that works which should have been spread over a number of years, ancl paid for out of the surplus revenue, have been held in abeyance, and that certain services have no doubt beenstarved.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE above the three-fourths to which they are entitled. of revenue was £ 8 7 0 , 0 0 0. ever, it appears that the increase will be £ 1,000,00 0 more, of which they will get £ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 .

In view of the fact that a very considerable sum will in any case be paid this year to the States Treasurers, the Commonwealth is perfectly justified, as long as it obeys section 87 of the Constitution-the Braddon section-in retaining the amount which it requires for purposes to which it is committed. Now, sir, I desire to say a few words in regard to one or two other matters which are dealt with under this B ill . clauses which are to supersede the sections of the Constitution which direct the book-keeping of the Treasury, the opportunity has been taken to give certain specific directions not given by the Constitution. For instance, the Constitution does not provide for the crediting of any revenue on a population basis. the Commonwealth shall credit to each State the revenues collected therein by the Commonwealth. the crediting of revenue received outside able member knows that we cannot get an It is a susthe Commonwealth, as, for instance, interest on moneys in London. Nor does it I also want honorprovide that such items as "" forfeited deposits on contracts for new works,"" and "" part cost of erection of telegraph and telephone lines,"" shall be credited, That is as is manifestly fair, on a population basis. In the matter of the erection of telephone and telegraph lines, for example, the case is this: Some private individuals very often pay to the Post and Telegraph Depa l'tment an amount! of money to defray part of the cost of the construction of a line which they are anxious tb obtain. No , I did not. That money goes into the Consolidated Revenue, and does not belong to any particular State. must pay it to some State.

TheI think the estimated increase money goes into the general revenue, and Now, howis distributed on a population basis. The Treasurer has in the past taken the responsibility of so crediting such amounts;' but as the opportunity now arises to legalize this practice, advantage is taken of it in this B ill. In certain exceptional cases Does he mean also expenditure in a State has not been debited to the State as directed in the Constitution. For instance, an arrangement was made, in which the States of New the expenditure on the' border Customs Houses should be equally divided between the two States instead of the State on whose side of the river a particular station happened to be being debited with the expenditure. Technically, I do not think that that is legal. Therefore, I am proposing to make it legal under this B ill . It is the proper thing to do.

An Order-in-Council, or a Minister's direction, is as effective as an Act of the Parliament for the interpretation of any provision of the Constitution. Therefore, I think we are being asked to exceed our powers. desirous to promote friendship and a feeling of common interest between the States and the Commonweialth, there is brought in a Bill to take from the States money to which they, are entitled, ifi the Commonwealth does not spend the whole of its one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue.

160,Sir John Forrest,"No doubt..the Conference of Premiers in 1899, section 87, which, as it left the Convention, was intended to exist in perpetuity, was limited to a period of ten years. Sir of the Convention, and I do not think it was the intention that that provision should remain in perpetuity. General will tell the Treasurer that it was so. In interpreting section 94, we should not omit to bear in mind its history, and what it was intended to mean as it left the Convention. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That is a very dangerous principle of construction. Sir JOHN FORREST I am putting the actual facts before the House. Nothing will be settled in regard to the meaning of section 94 until the High Court has had to deal with it j and it is more difficult to construe now than it would have been had section 87 been placed in the Constitution as it left the Convention. As I said just now, I believe that the words ""surplus revenue,"" when interpreted by the High Court, may have an entirely different meaning from that which the Convention intended. intended by the Convention to apply to the unexpended balance of the one-fourth, ""which was the maximum the Commonwealth could spend. I wish to make it quite clear, as I have said once or twice before, that there is no doubt whatever as to the power of the Commonwealth to spend the whole of the one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue. But I say most certainly that ""appropriation"" cannot be deemed' to be ""expenditure "" as proposed in this B ill . One would think it would not be necessary to labour the point, because the idea that under section 87 of the Constitution appropriation should be deemed to mean expenditure is one that ought to be flouted by every reasonable person. means to expend annually. Sir able member for Swan when in office has paid money on an appropriation in many cases. Sir London money. vote for that expenditure. Sir WILLIAM LYNE -expended on an appropriation. Sir JOHN FORREST It was the system which Sir George Turner instituted of sending the money Home ready to be paid, and> in y case, my following that praca n affects the practice. dealing now with what we should like to do, or what would be convenient, but with what is statutory and just to the States, even if , in doing justice, we injure ourselves. The Commonwealth may spend the whole of the one-fourth,' but, if it does not spend the whole, I contend that the unexpended balance must be paid monthly to the States. Supposing we concede for one moment that appropriation does mean expenditure, what would be easier than for the Federal Government or Parliament to place large sums on the Estimates which we knew could not be required, such, for instance, as the £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 for advertising Australia, when we know that we shall spend no more than £ 5 ^ 0 0 ? There is also a vote of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 for armaments, although we know we are not going to spend any such sum. What is really proposed by this B ill is to appropriate the In my opinion the words were whole of the balance, and thus deprive the States of it , although we may not spend sixpence of it . Is that fair? Mr W. H . IRVINE An appropriation lapses if it is not used. Sir JOHN FORREST T h at is so, and very properly so; but there is no lapse in the case of a trust fund. Where is our power to make trust funds, and thus take the money away from the States? A trust fund' is a means of holding money until the owner claims it , and I submit that we cannot appropriate £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 for armaments, and, placing the money in a trust fund, thus deprive the States of it . I sav that such a proposal is neither reasonable nor proper. right honourable member did something like Sir JOHN FORREST I do not think so. trust fun d created in that connection. every month, but we have an appropriation for it , and it must be paid during the year in which it was voted.

168,Mr Joseph 'Cook,"There is a specialSir JOHN FORREST The n it ought to be, because it is an expenditure of the year. ' According to the proposal and intention of the Treasurer, this money wil l not be returned to the States, but will be appropriated, to be reapprdpriated, perhaps, later on to quite another object, because money put into a trust fund can, by Act of Parliament, be taken out of that fund, and expendedas we like. This is a subterfuge to keep this money from the States, and, by putting it into a reserve fund called a trust fund, deprive them ,of their just due. That was not the intention or meaning of the framers of the Constitution, and it has not been done by any Treasurer, under the advice of any Attorney-General, during There are, I believe, twenty-four trust funds already, for the most part legitimate, though there may be one or two not quite so. On the""3ist December last, according to the public accounts, there was £ 3 4 4 , 0 0 0 of the people on the land, and the opento the credit of those trust funds. I believe that was an excessive, amount, owing to special circumstances at the particular time; and it has not been so large since, though it has been over' £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 . Trust funds are, no doubt, very convenient, and, .speaking generally, when they are bond fide, are unobjectionable. posal in the B ill is not bond fide; it does not propose a trust fund for a specific purpose, as in the other cases mentioned. The Bill has for its object the placing of large sums in reserve, to be used hereafter, either for the purpose declared, or, probably, reappropriated later on for some other purposes, the States in the meantime being deprived of their moneys, Treasurer clearly stated that the object of the Bill was to retain these moneys, and place them in reserve funds to be used as necessary later on. moneys beyond the one-fourth. Sir JOHN FORREST the whole of the one-fourth for Commonwealth purposes, I should have nothing to say; what I object to is taking the money and putting it on one side, and not using it. monwealth Government have tried their best to limit their expenditure. As I have said, time and again, there has been no extravagance on the part of the Federal Government. There may be some matters in which, had we the time over again, we might act differently; but, generally speaking, the Commonwealth Government and Parliament have been economical, and tried i.o return as much as possible to the States. My predecessor, Sir George Turner, went to great lengths in the latter direction, because those were rather hard days in the States, ancl his efforts were beneficial to some of them, especially Tasmania and Queensland, who suffered a great loss of revenue owing to Federation. did not get her three-fourths.' Sir JOHN FORREST T h at is so, while some other States were getting very much more than their three-fourths. However, the Federal Government, did their best all along, the seven years of Federation. and it has been the policy throughout to economize, bearing jn view the great obligations that lie on the States Governments. We must not forget that the States Governments have in their hands the settling ing up and development of the country by means of railways, roads, and bridges, in addition to the responsibility of the public education. With a knowledge ot all these facts, I , when Treasurer, desired to give rather than take away from the States. Now, however, we have a proposal But the proto take money awa!y from the States, not, in my opinion, legitimately, or in a . bona fide way, but, by what I may call a side wind-by altering the procedure which, up to the present, has been acknowledged to be right. If such a step be taken, -without any necessity, it will embitter the feeling between Commonmonwealth and States. It is true that, The without counting the first half-year of Federation, which was very unsettled, there has been returned to the States, during the six years, over £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 more than the three-fourths of the revenue to which they were entitled. There is no doubt that no the Commonwealth could have spent that money had it been in the interests of Australia to do so. But iin such case the If we used States would have suffered, Tasmania and Queensland very largely. It is now proposed that we should retain this money for the future, and put it out of reach in a reserve fund,' calTebl a trust fund, so that During the last seven years the Comlater on, when it has accumulated, we may appropriate it,, possibly for some other purpose altogether. That was not the feeling that honourable members had towards the States in the early days of Federation, nor is it , in my opinion, the intention of section 87 of the Constitution.

170,Mr Bamford,"Queenslan d occasionally,there is another matter of law to which I should like to direct the attention of the Attorney-General. I have already raised, I have to say further that the Bill is opposed to section 36 of the Audit Act. What does that section say?Every appropriation made out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the service of any financial year shall lapse and cease to have any effect for any purpose at the close of that year. a bond fide trust fund at all. The section goes onand any balance of the moneys so appropriated which may then be unexpended shall lapse, and the accounts of the year shall be then closed. when the honourable member was Treasurer ? they did. But they were bond fide trust funds. This, however, is an attempt to make a trust fund of that which is not a trust fund at all. This Bill says that, notwithstanding what the Audit Act provides, sums, having been appropriated, shall be regarded as expended. fund; that is what it means. The term ""Trust Fund"" is a subterfuge. not a trust fund in the true sense at all. A trust fund is a fund established in relation -to moneys that do not belong to the Government, and which have to be paid when the owner comes along; or it is a fund established for departmental convenience. Why, in these late days, should this attempt be made to fake money away from the States and keep it in reserve for some other purposes? This is not a matter of -likes or dislikes. interpretation of the Constitution, by which we are bound. . The question at issue will not be settled until we have an authoritative judgment upon it by the High 'Court. I await with some curiosity the course my honourable friend the leader of the Labour Party will take in regard to this matter. I am anxious to know whether he will do justice to the States. I am of opinion that the facts must appeal to him that this is an attempt-a m unjustifiable one totry to get money that is legally due to the . States put aside to be used hereafter for various .purposes. my honourable friends, the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, should have subscribed to this Bill. [349] well understand the Treasurer wanting money to be put aside to be used by him. Besides the objections I do not suppose that he has looked very closely into the technicalities of the mea'sure. But that remark cannot apply to the. Prime Minister and the Attorney-General. I cannot understand how they can have allowed such a Bill to be introduced. Every measure introduced by the Government must have the imprimatur of the Attorney-General. How the Attorney General can tell us that what it is proposed to do under this measure is in accord with section' 87 of the Constitution, I cannot understand. The Bill will do a great deal of harm. It certainly can do no good It must irritate the States. The. question concerned is not likely to be settled until we obtain a decision from the High Court; and we have figured in that Court already. I do not see why we should encourage these difficulties which necessitate our appearance in the High Court in opposition to the States, especially during these last years of the operation of the Braddon section. I desire to say, in conclusion, that fhe opinions which I have . expiessed are those which' I honestly hold, and which There is to be a reserve have actuated me ever since I have been a member of this House, and while I was the It is Treasurer of the Commonwealth. .

Sir WILLIAM to acknowledge it-quit e unintentionally. Mr W. H . IRVINE It is a mere pershall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund to sonal matter, about which I do not feel one way or another. But, on that occa""sion, I went pretty f u l ly into what I thought was the true view of the Constitution. I do not intend to say very much more at this stage on tliat point, except this-that I think my right honourable ' friend the member for Swan's condemnation of the B ill , and his indignation af such a measure being brought forward; were to some extent based upon a misapprehension of the section of the .Constitution to which he referred. Sir JOHN in which the section has been interpreted in practice anyway. Mr W. H . IRVINE should be very sorry to impose on honorabls members a long constitutional argument; and the only excuse I can make for going, into the matter at all is that, as the right honourable member for Swan feels grave doubts about the. question, I ought, as a matter of ordinary courtesy to him,' to do so. if we do not entertain strong doubts we ought to express our opinions. view which I put on a former occasion is this: The matter all depends upon the proper interpretation to put upon two or three.sections of the Constitution. regard to the view that has been put, that advice has been given, and that a practice has been adopted by the Department, that argument would be very strong except for this fact: that during the five years, until October, 1906, no other practice could be followed except the distribution which the section expressly provided for. lowing seems to me to be the scheme unannual appropriation. der which the financial sections of the -Constitution were-drafted. proposed was never suggested before.

Now, we. must see howwhichevery self-governing community has far the general power is cut .down by I had anticithrough its Parliament. If it is to be a Parliament at all-anythin g more than a municipal institution-it must have a general power of appropriating its revenue. That section saysLYNE I merely omitted All revenues or moneys raised or received by the Executive Government of the Commonweal th be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution. To leave out of consideration the ' ' charges and liabilities "" for the moment, let us see what would be involved in the meaning of -the term ""appropriation."" ""Appropriation "" does not mean merely appropriation for the ordinary current services for the month, or for the year. It covers the putting of money to any purposes-for , as I understand it , this year or next year or any other future time-so long as those Commonwealth, and are authorized by an Act of Parliament. I might take a very I certainly simple instance. Suppose this Parliament borrowed money, and desired to create a sinking fun d for its repayment. That is the simplest example of all. You may have two kinds of sinking funds. You may have a sinking fund whereby Parliament annually pays towards the repayment of the debt certain moneys, by means of I think that even which it provides for principal and interest. But there is another and a more The usual kind of sinking fund, such as is established in nearly all the States of the Union. You borrow money, say, in England, and you agree with the lender that With you shall pay him annual interest, and, when the time for redemption comes, the principal. In the meantime Parliament may say, "" We shall create a sinking fund, putting aside annually enough to enable us to pay the debt when it becomes due."" That would be making a trust fund . Mr W. H . IRVINE -Such action would come within the meaning of the propriation.

Mr W. H . IRVINE is plain. During the period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, and theregiven. after until the Parliament otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of Customs and of Excise, not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure. What is the difference between that and the expression in section 81 ? To be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth, is to . be applied to the purposes of the Commonwealth, or to be applied towards the expenditure of the Commonwealth. All the money which we appropriate is expended, if not this year, next year or some other year. expenditure of some year. . We may appropriate this year for one hundred purposes in connection with which the actual expenditure will not take place this year. distribute funds derived from other sources than Customs and Excise, although the Treasurer has been doing it . absolute limitation. twelve months, it must mean three-fourths within those twelve months. Mr W. H . IRVINE is not a limitation of the actual expenditure, but of the amount which may be taken for the purposes of the expenditure. A stream of revenue is flowing past, and section 87 of the Constitution says that the Commonwealth shall not take more than one-fourth of it . Suppose we returned to the States only three-fourths, could their Treasurers say to us, "" You have returned to us three-fourths, and have purported to apply the rest. We wish to go into your'books and estimates, 'to ascertain whether you have actually expended' during this month the moneys which you have not returned to us"" ?

My contention is that, reading these provisions together, "" surplus "" means money that has not been appropriated by Parliament; It is a very simple meaning; there is nothing to cut it down. It gives f u l l effect to our right as a Parliament to appropriate our money as we think fit for Federal purposes; it also gives f u l l effect to the provisions of section 87 for the protection of the States. the question of policy ? Mr W. H . IRVINE matter. If I believed, as does the right honourable member for Swan, that in passing this Bill we should transgress our constitutional powers, or that we should be attempting, by means of an Act of Parliament, to place upon the Constitution an interpretation that we have power to . do something that we could not possibly do, I should feel as. indignant as he apparently does. But I do not regard this proposal in that light. Subject to one important consideration, to which I shall refer in a moment, I think that this is a very reasonable business-like proposition to make, and that it does not impinge upon the rights of the States. Sir power is so clearly conferred by the Concourtesy, we should consult the States stitution, that it has not occurred to any one Treasurers? . before to seek to use it. Mr W. H .

I read recently that the Premier of New South Wales had requested-and perhaps the same request also emanated from other quarters-that the Premiers of the States should have an opportunity at the forthcoming Conference to place their views before us with regard to this B ill , so that the Parliament might, with a f u l l knowledge of what were the views of the States authorities, exercise its powers in this reabout gard: Why should we not afford them that opportunity ? shouldsubmit questions of great national policy to the determination of the Premiers Of the States? Mr W. H . IRVINE No ; but there is a difference between doing that and adopting the course which has been suggested byone if not more of the Premiers of the States. I said' as strongly as I could at an early stage this session that I thought that Conferences of States' Premiers had repeatedly gone rather too f a r ; but that is not exactly the present situation.

Why, then, is this proposal, so drastic and far-reaching as it affects the relations of the Commonwealth with the States, brought forward at the present time? ments fro and con as to the constitutionality -of the Bill, and having read the Constitution, so far as my abilities will permit me, I have no doubt as to the constitutionality -of the procedure proposed . by the Government. There is no doubt that we can vary the arrangements with regard to the disposal of, our surplus revenue; that we can if we choose create these proposed trust accounts Mr W. H . member might take the example of all special appropriations which do not lapse under the Audit Act. to create these special trust accounts, and, as I think, to make provision for any extraordinarily large additional expenditures which may from time to time come under the purview of this Parliament. I do not attack the constitutionality of this B ill ; I attack its wisdom, its inopportuneness. Like many of the other financial proposals -of the Government, it is tentative, paltry and entirely inadequate to meet the financial situation. As such it comes fitly from a Government that has been proceeding on those lines through the whole course of its -existence, and is to-day only fulfilling the promise of its career made from the beginfiing of its existence. I , therefore, confine myself to the consideration of the question whether it is wise, after the lapse of nearly -eight years of the ten that have to run ""before a re-arrangement of the whole financial position must take place, to deal with the matter in this piecemeal way. Mr W. H .

Last year the Government submitted a definite :and comprehensive scheme at the Brisbane Premiers' Conference..

I do say, however, that, in my opinion, it is the best scheme proposed by a Treasurer up to date, and I believe that, shorn of one or two of its provisions which, I think, err a little on the side of generosity to the States -thoug h that is a good side to err on-the scheme, on the whole, is a statesmanlike proposal for the settlement of this muchvexed question. But now we find the new Treasurer coming in and upsetting that scheme in this piecemeal way. Such legislation, I think, is unwise; and, as I shall propose in my amendment, I think we ought to wait until the whole relations of the States and the Commonwealth can be taken into account. I propose to move, if the prior amendment is withdrawn to enable me to do so, that all the words after "" That"" be omitted, in order to insert "" the consideration of this Bill be postponed until the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States can be dealt with as a whole."" It is not a question of what we have a right to do under the Constitution. It has-been the curse of this Parliament in the past that we have been fighting for some supposed rights we have under the Constitution-right s which we could turn against the States to their detriment and to our advantage.

There is a gap of two or three years in which we have no complete statistics of the Commonwealth'; and, in order to fill the gap, it is necessary for the Government to take some action. As will be readily understood, the lapse of time makes the statistics more difficult to obtain; and, in my opinion, the years involved are important. .Coghlan's Seven Colonies covers a very considerable period, and brings the statistics of Australia and New Zealand up to a certain time; and the understanding was that Mr Coghlan should fill up the gap. 'When he left for England, he took material with him, so I understand, which would enable him to bring his volume up to date; but I have seen a newspaper paragraph to the effect that Mr Coghlan does not propose to carry out the work. If that be so, the Commonwealth Statistician should do something, or, otherwise, there will be a gap of two or three important years in the early history of the able member that there will be no gap.

Honourable members receive a monthly progressive report of trade returns, printed on superfine paper, in the most expensive style, a sheer waste of monely. At the very most, these reports are not required more than once every three months; and even that, 1 should say, is unnecessary. We do not need to have printed every month returns of the shipping, and minor details about imports and exports. Such information might be all very well during a Tariff discussion; and even then we did not get the exact figures from the statistical as much saving as :is reasonable and office. In my opinion, the Minister ought to put his foot down, and see that this extravagant expenditure is stopped. The printing bill is already very considerable, and this "" other printing "" is unwarrantable. I should not complain if these reports were issued every half-year, but, even then, I think there is room for economy. to call attention to the large increase of expenditure in this Department. In postage and telegrams I see there has been spent some £300, and I desire to know whether or not it is a fact that in some Departments there is a growing practice on the part of officials to use the telegraphs when not really necessary, in order to save the trouble of corresponding by letter. It would be interesting to know how much of this £300 has been expended in postage and how much in unnecessary telegrams. Then there is another large item of £1,650 for temporary assistance, and I desire to say that, in my opinion, except in circumstances of extreme urgency, a check should be placed on the engagement of such assistance. porarily does not give those employed a prior right to permanent appointments, the general impression is in the minds of those so employed that there is some preferential claim.

These cleaners are women, and their method of appointment is most unsatisfactory, seeing that there is a separate list kept for every Department.

We cannot have bur statistics published too promptly. I take it that these monthly issues are simply like bankers' monthlv balances. A man who is interested even in bones, hoofs, and horns may want to see the amount of imports and exports in any particular month. The honourable member for Coolgardie savs that a business man can go to the Customs House and ascertain what he wants to know. I do not Personknow whether the honourable member has.

I once spent three months in hunting up information on a subject; and I say, "" God help the man who goes to the Customs House to get statistics."" These monthly records are not meant to be read from cover to cover, but a member of Parliament, or a member of the public who wants statistical information on any subject for any month, turns to one of these books, and hunts it up. I doubt whether the monthly issues are the cause of much expense. Whether they are or not. can be ascertained by putting a question to the Minister. I shall certainly vote against the amendment.

This anomaly, therefore, now exists, that a number of other townships of considerable arid growing importance are not supplied. I urge the Government to increase this service, and make it more efficient. Nothing can be of greater advantage to those on the land than to have timely and regular weather information. Where stations are connected with telephone bureaux it ought to be possible for those who wish for it to obtain weather information from the lccal telegraph office. it is likely to rain next day ? have an interest, but they are nbt so important as records of rainfall, which are extremely useful to those who are dealing in stock, or are following agricultural pursuits.

It would, doubtless, involve an expenditure so stupendous that I do not think we should be justified at present in-undertaking it ; but we should, at all events, give the officers of the various Departments more power than they appear to have to carry out works involving a trifling expenditure, without the intervention of the Works Departments of the States. . For some time there has been a proposal to erect a new post-office at Katoomba, and also one at Lithgow. The site for a new post-office at Katoomba has been purchased, and I understand that plans I am sorry to say that have been prepared, but, although the matter has been in hand for some years, I do not know that a transfer has actually been drawn up. The work was determined upon before I entered this House, instance of Mr and still the townspeople are crying out for it, and the Department is paying a much larger rent than the interest on the proposed outlay would involve. No headway seems to have been made. The case of the Lithgow Post-office is even worse, because the Department has not yet made up its mind where they will place it . Before we adjourned, an item of £ r , o o o was placed on the Estimates towards this building, and, in my youthful parliamentary innocence, I thought the matter was quite settled. However, nothing has been done; and there is a dispute amongst the townspeople themselves as to where the office ought to be. Owing to the present arrangements the business is in a state of chaos; and I think the Department ought to take on itself the responsible y of saving where the post-office shall be placed. I understand that the Departmental Inspectors have on two difinterposition of States ferent occasions recommended sites; and the late Postmaster-.General visited the place, and selected one for himself. ter-General had made his decision, the State officials reported that the. selected",52,Brown Calare Member For Calare With Whose Remarks

There is a feeling that Melbourne enjoys something of a monopoly of the advantages accruing from the presence of the. Governor General and his suite in this city. My only complaint is that we do not see him quite as often as we should like in the principal city of the Commonwealth. There is, 1 hoticej a great difference between the cost of the upkeep of Government Houses in Melbourne and Sydney.. There is a difference of £ 3 0 0 in the upkeep of the grounds alone. For fhe upkeep of the grounds in Sydney there is an expenditure of £ 1 , 0 0 0; whilst on the grounds in Melbourne there is an expenditure of £1,300. Then, again, for the House itself there is £500 for maintenance in Sydney, and £600 in Melbourne. In Melbourne again sanitation and water supply absorb £1,168. There is an increase in the appropriation for the Melbourne' establishment t'o that extent, the amount last year being £2,915, whilst this year it is £4,083. Perhaps the Minister in charge will explain what is meant by the item "" non-recurring works"" on account of both Melbourne and Sydney Government' Houses, and why the whole of the expenditure in connection with Government House is not placed under one heading? When we have dealt with it under the Department of Home Affairs we should not have to deal with it again in connection with the Treasury. that im the one case the amount is. more or less personal, and in the other it is chosen. purely official. more convenient to have this expenditure to believe that it will not be where the placed under one heading under one DeMinister of Trade and Customs desires to partment?

The Seat of Government Act does not fix the site.

Hundredweights of printed matter are destroyed as of no use by returning officers, and yet the administration is so bad that forms absolutely necessary are not to be had at the polling booths, with the result that in South' Australia a large number of people were deprived of the franchise. Here there is room for much inquiry, and I may point out that the working of the Commonwealth Act has been very defective as compared with the working of the South Australian Act. would not have occurred if we had been working under the State Act to which I have referred. However, I now desire to call attention to the vote of £ 1 , 5 0 0 towards the expense of making inquiries and preparing plans for additional lighthouses required on the coast of Australia. DoI understand that the Commonwealth is at the present time expending money on lighthouses and so forth, which are not under their control ? In some States there are no light dues at all, and, therefore, this will If the whole question is to be prove a very unprofitable administration. I hope that before undertaking any responsibility the Government will consider the advisability of imposing light dues throughout Australia. In South Australia, the light dues show a profit over expenditure, but that is not so in Queensland and some other States, and, therefore, I hope such time as proper legislation is introduced and passed. Unfortunately that is should like to know whether any arrangement has been made in regard to paying True, it names the expenses of those concerned in the recent South Australian election legal proceedings. Is it proposed to recoup the candidates their expenses, seeing that all the trouble arose through the acts of departmental officers? two or three days ago said that the whole matter was before the Department-it is a question of law. under present circumstances, an Act ought to be passed, because neither of the candidates ought to be called upon to bear this expenditure. I should now like to draw (Hindmarsh) attention to the item of £ 5 0 0 towards comI desire to call attention to the piling a map of Australasia. When is that map going to be placed before us ? Is the Treasurer waiting until we can see on it the site of the Federal Capital? This item has appeared on fhe Estimates year after year, and the work is apparently no nearer completion. [10.19] -As to the item of £23,-500, expenses in connection with the administration of the Electoral Act, I think there may be something in the contention of the honourable member for Hindmarsh that saving may be effected in the printing and so forth, though I do think at the last general election there was an effort made at cutting There have ""been mistakes which down expenses, which gave rise to a serious problem from the point of view of the secrecy of the ballot. This difficulty is more particularly felt in country districts. For the first time the Department introduced the principle of dispensing with a poll clerk at a great number of booths, with the result that the whole of the work had to be done by one officer, who was very often a local resident with, perhaps, some bias. A great deal of suspicion was aroused on this account. .",59,Brown Calare Member For Calare With Whose Remarks

The State Government of New South Wales would never think for one moment of conducting an election under such conditions. I do not say that there were any malpracticesI do not know of any-bu t the conditions are such as to invite maladministration, and the remedy is the employment of two officers. This would mean very little extra expense, and the additional security would more than compensate for the outlay.""

I had had communications, personal and otherwise, with several members of the Torres Straits Pilots' Association, who urged upon me, -when I was last at Thursday Island, the absolute necessity for extra lightingupon the coast between Cairns and Thursday Island. at present it is not nearly so well lighted as it ought to be. thirty new lights have been asked for. lights are absolutely necessary on the coast to which I have referred. itself deQueensland Government has kept a number of lights going without receiving any revenue, and under all the circumstances they have done very well indeed. They could hardly be expected to place additional lights on the coast since the Commonwealth is about to take over this work. It is advisable that we should do it thoroughly when we are doing it at all. more until we take over lighthouses. taken to provide for some of the lights that are requisite? am not sure. vernment invited the shipping companies to' make representations? going on for a long time. orable member for Swan returned from the north, I had a letter from him, in which he said that he had consulted some of the pilots; who convinced him of the necessity of having more lights on that coast.

[10.29] -There is a vote upon the Estimates in regard to compiling a map of Australasia. What is being done in 'that matter? Is it proposed to take in New Zealand and Fiji? We have heard something about the necessity for more lights on the western, coast, but very little is said Last May, when about the Queensland coast. Going down that coast lately, I found that the ship anchored because the captain could not I took occasion to write to pick up a certain light. In the morning he found that if he had kept on his course five minutes longer, he would have picked up the light quite easily. But he said that the coast was so dangerous that, although he had been on it for about twenty years and knew it very well, yet if he could not pick up a light to the minute he always went to anchor. Beyond It is a very dangerous coast, and Thursday Island also more lights are urgently necessary. I hope that the Treasurer, who is a practical business man, will I think that about look into the matter.

510,Mr Henry Willis (Robertson),"this is a newly-established system, or whether it has been in operation for any length of time? If so, what good results have followed from the suggestions made by officers? It seems to me to be a good idea to. give gratuities of this kind. is quite common in commercial houses to do this sort of thing, but in private concerns the men who make the suggestions are those who get the money. On what basis is this Commonwealth money distributed ? [10.32] -In relation to the electoral administration, I should like to make an observation regarding the striking of names off the rolls. There seems to be something very lax in this direction. Electors have told me that their names have been struck off the rolls, although they were on for years previously, and voted at the last election. .They do not know why it has been done, nor why their names did not appear on the supplementary rolls. Possibly one reason, so far as the large centres are concerned, may be that the returning officers are most inadequately paid. Some of their assistants get nearly, as much for temporary work as they do for a whole year's service As to. gratuities to officers, I desire to point out that some time ago I had the pleasure of looking through a new mail van. In the old vans there was no room for the proper sorting of letters, and it was always a marvel to me how ihe work was done. In the new mail vans there are ingenious arrangements by means of which the work can be expeditiously done. I understand that some of the officers who are doing the sorting work gave advice to the Department as to the best method of constructing the cars. If those suggestions were valuable, I hope that the officers will have a share in the vote upon this Division. share of the Home Affairs vote. to three or four awards for valuable suggestions made in my Department. hear that. The amount seems very small for this one Department. I hope that real encouragement is being given to officers, and believe that enormous savings are likely to be made if consideration is fairly given to suggestions made. -The matter of the valuation of prothe computation of the projection on which the perties taken over from the States has been map is to be compiled. This projection will be before us for several years. I believe that the whole of the properties have now beenvalued. It readiness for the Commonwealth tb do what, in fairness, it should have done several years ago, namely, to come to an arrangement with the States Governments to pay for the properties thus taken over. (Hindmarsh) that until they were valued have elapsed since Federation, and the valuation has only just been completed. Some of the States have been very anxious to have the matter settled. I am aware that objection is taken to cash being paid. That is a matter of arrangement between the States and the Commonwealth, but cer-' tainly the States should be relieved of the payment of interest for money borrowed on the properties taken over by the Commonwealth. orable member think that the States have been relieved by the large amount of money we have paid to them? ""Commonwealth has been generous to the States in returning money does not affect the point that there was a distinct agreement between the States and the Commonwealth in regard to these properties, which should be paid for in some shape or form. There was a square deal between the Commonwealth, and the States, and the Gommonwealth should carry out its part of the agreement by relieving the States of the interest on the cost of construction. I hope that no time will be lost in giving attention to this matter,. and that there will thus be -removed what, in some of the States at least, has been a cause of friction.

With respect to the transferred properties, the valuations are now complete, and Colonel Miller is preparing a report which should be in the hands of the Minister in a few weeks, when. action will follow, though how soon I cannot say. There will be no undue delay, As to the taking over of the control of the lighthouses, the authorities of the States have been consulted, and advice has been obtained from ship captains, pilots, and all others likely to be able to give information of Value. Something has also been done in the preparation of plans, and Parliament has made provision for the appointment of an officer to further assist the Government in this matter. Nothing more, can be done until the States Departments are transferred to the Commonwealth, and, in all probability early next session, for that purpose a Bill will be introduced. taking over of the control of lighthouses, beacons, and buoys is a very important matter, and I hope that a Bill will be introduced to give effect to it early next session. On the Queensland coast, in particular, the increased volume of trade, which hasnecessitated the employment of ships of larger draught, carrying of course, bigger and more valuable cargoes and a larger number of passengers, has made it increasingly necessary to improve the lighting of the intricate waters of the pilots,and all connected with shipping are unanimously of the opinion that this imConsiderable attention should also be given to the lighting of part of the coast ofWestern Australia and of part of trie Victorian coast.
