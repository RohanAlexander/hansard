Elliot Johnson","lia s the attention of the Minister for the Navy been drawn to a complaint made i a tins morning's paper by a returned wounded eoldier to tbe effect thab on applying to the Defence Department for a clerical position, he was referred to the secretary, of the union, and that on going to the -secretary of the union he was denied the right to apply for an appointment unti l he had joined the union and paid an entrance fee ? I wish to know whether that policy is in accordance w i th the promise made by Mr Fisher that returned soldiers would get the first chance of employment f the question; and, if possible, I should age? like to be furnished with the name of the soldier in question. MrW . ELLIOT JOHNSON -Very well. tion asked by the righ t honourable member the. Commonwealth Government on the .for Swan a littl e while ago as to the in ability of some transports to get f u l l loading when returning to Australia, to which question the Minister for the Navy replied that Borne difficulty was occasioned by the Shipping Ringi n England, will the Minister now explain to what extent the Shipping Ring interfered with our transports in the matter of securing back loadcally the same as that submitted by the right honourable member for Swan. A certain transport, with a capacity of 8,000 tons of general cargo, did leave England with 1,000 tons only. It appears that the owners of the vessel, which the Commonwealth Government had commandeered, said that they would arrange to procure back loading for her from England to Australia, but when the Commonwealth agents in London approached them, in accordance with the offer which had been made, the fir m endeavoured to lay down certain stipulations and conditions that we could"" not accept. We were paying the owners a certain sum per day for demurrage, and* yet they attempted to tie us down to a payment of £ 2 10s. per ton for general a ton, it being their intention to keep the difference. We objected to this proposal, and that is how the ship came back with such a small tonnage of cargo. the Wheat Pool have promised that the farmers shall receive a further advance of 6d. per bushel on their wheat as soon as freight and banking arrangements will enable it to be done, can the Acting Leader of the House inform us when that 6d. is likely to be paid? I understand that an additional sale of wheat has been effected which should enable it to be done. Also., can the Minister inform us as to the result of the negotiations between the Prime Minister and the authorities in I should like notice of London wibh respect to additional freightof the Wheat Boardi t would be difficult for me to give an answer off-hand, but if the honourable member w ill p ut a question on the notice-paper I shall see Sena-",4,Setup

The inference that I am doing something to undermine the Labour policy is not a fair one. that overtime ordered to be paid by the letter-carriers' months, will the Postmaster-General struct bis officers to pay overtime the month in which it is earned 1 as practicable, but there are times when the officers do not furnish the information early enough to enable the Accounts Branch to do so. Whenever that information is supplied in time, I shall see that the men are paid their overtime, as the honourable member requests. out of 1,229 men who offered to enlist last week in Victoria, only 628 were accepted, showing a rejection o i a little under 50 per cent. W ill the Minister for the Navy ascertain the reasons fdr this heavy percentage of rejections, in order that honourable members may form an estimate of the satisfactory nature or otherwise of the cause ? comply with the request of the honourable member. for the Navy have prepared for presentation to honourable members a return showing the number of men who offered for enlistment, the number rejected, and the reasons for their rejection, in all the States during last week ? for the Navy whether it is correct, as reported in this morning's paper, that the demands of the temporary clerks at Cockatoo and Garden Islands have been granted I have not departed unconditionally, whether these demands have been before the Minister previously; if they were fair and reasonable, why they were-not granted then; and, if they were I have already asked for an exnot f a ir and reasonable, why they axe granted now? certain instructions to the management of Cockatoo Island and Garden Island that the-latest award for the clerks should be put into operation.

It appears that there inwas some dispute between the managewithin ment and the men with reg&rd to this time. The dispute was not because the It will be done as far conditions of the award had not been allowed by the Minister, because I had already sent word that the clerks were to be given what the award provided. There was practically no dispute between the Minister and the clerks. It appears that when the time-sheets were sent in some difference of opinion arose between ' the men and the manager. The secretary of the Clerks Union endeavoured to land at Cockatoo Island, in order to speak to the It is reported that men during the luncheon hour. He was refused permission to land, and I think that was what precipitated the trouble.

MinisterI have had a recommendation before me from the management of Cockatoo Island to grant certain increases, over and above the award rates, to clerks who are doing special work. It 1 was only on Saturday morning that I acceded to it , after receiving instructions from the Government to do so.

In that report, there is a repetition of some portion of my remarks. This was due to the fact that the Minister of Home Affairs, to whose Department I was referring, came into the Chamber while I was speaking, and, for his information, I had, in some measure, to repeat myself. I should like you to give orders that, when Hansard appears in volume form, some in t i mation of the circumstances may be made, so as to explain the duplication. tain statements were made in a newspaper, and on Fnaay the members concerned definitely and distinctly replied in this House. On Saturday, the same newspaper, after having published these replies, inserted a paragraph that I did not observe at the time, to this effectI t is hardly necessary, perhaps, but it might be as well to say that the information we published was given to us by members who were in the best possible position to speak of what occurred. The general accuracy of that information was confirmed yesterday by other members.

That is merely a declaration, and there is a big difference between declaration and proof. that the Argus disbelieves the statements made by Ministers, and that it is entitled to deny the t r u th of those statements.

66,Mr Higgs (Capricornia,"Treasurer )members do not consider that enough. I hope that it w ill be agreed that I am as sympathetic as are most men to persons in distress, but it is my duty to caution the House as to the nature of our financial obligations. I thought it proper to postpone the estimate of our future obligations until presenting my next Budget statement, but from what I have observed it would appear to be necessary to in form honourable members that our war loan indebtedness to 30th June, 1917, will be £109,000,000. The interest on that sum will be approximately £5,000,000. We have to oontemplate the setting apart of a certain sum as a sinking f u n d for the extinction of the debt, and if we decide upon a sinking f u n d of \ per cent, that will involve an additional payment. Interest tions to meet indebtedness on war loans amount to some £5,550,000 a year. Honourable members will discern that that will be new expenditure which must be met somehow either from revenue we are at present receiving or from additional taxation. We have again to remember that we shall have to pay in terest on the money that must be borrowed to pay the Imperial authorities for their expenditure in maintaining and equipping our soldiers abroad. The probable amount of that indebtedness is not known because, although we have repeatedly made requests for information on the subject, the Imperial Government for some reason or another are not able to tell us how much they propose to charge us for the maintenance and equipment of our soldiers while on active service. amount for interest on money which must be borrowed to pay the deferred pay which will be due to our soldiers at the end of June, 1917, and which will amount to about £9,000,000. The estimate of the amount due to 30th June, 1916, is £4,500,000, and we have in a rough and ready way doubled that amount as the estimate of what will be due for deferred pay at the end of June, 1917, but it may be more. will be more. be at least £9,000,000. covered by the war loan money ? tional. We shall have to provide for' the interest that must be paid on money borrowed for that purpose. There will further be interest to pay on the money which we will borrow to assist the States in connection w i th the settlement of returned soldiers on the land. A t the Conference which was held some time ago the Commonwealth Government agreed to assist in the matter of the payment of in terest on money borrowed for this purpose for a certain period. The amount of our obligation in this regard cannot now be estimated, but it will have to be met, and will be a charge upon our revenue. I therefore urge honourable members to be good enough to accept the proposals of the Government for the increase of and sinking fund obligamilitary pensions. We have been quite sympathetic in the matter, and have proto. 30th June, 1917, will posed the increases which we thought ought to be made in view of all the circumstances. If at some future time the Commonwealth is so prosperous that we can afford to further increase the military pensions the present Government, if in power, will be quite ready to bring forward proposals for the purpose. of peace what we are not prepared to do now in this connection. When peace comes we shall forget all these things. members will carefully examine the Government proposals.

Thereafter the rate is "" subject to reduction to seven-eighths of the maximum rate if and so long as the member is capable of earning at least 6s. a week."" not to go into details at this stage. There are one or two matters of principle I wish to bring under the notice of the Treasurer. I do not think that tlie Act has been administered in accordance witn the wishes of honourable members, or the intention of the House at the time it was passed. On that occasion, I spoke very strongly in favour of the pension becoming the absolute property of the individual to whom it might be granted. held that it was simply the country's acknowledgment to the individual who had served his country, and suffered loss in doing so; and that, however inadequate it might be to compensate for that loss, whatever pension was granted should not be disturbed by any circumstances which might arise. But we find that if a pensioner, who has been granted a partial pension for the loss of a leg, or an arm, or both legs, has some other means of support, increasing his total income, with the pension, above the maximum amount of the pension that a soldier may get, the pension is reduced. I do not think that this should be the case, though the Act is so worded as to enable it to be done, because it will close a very large number of avenues of employment to our returned soldiers. There are many occupations which partially incapacitated men may take up for which they may get small pay. Por instance, they may have charge of allowance post-offices. tered throughout Australia many small communities where the people would be only too happy and willing to provide a returned soldier with a couple of acres of ground, and build him a small cottage, and where the person controlling the allowance post-office would be only too willing to hand over the control of it to him. In such cases the returned soldier would be earning from £ 4 0 to £ 6 0 by running the post-office, and with a free home and his pension, he would have a comfortable living among people with whom he has been reared, and by whom he would bo respected for the rest of his life . I do not see why that principle should not be carried out very largely in Australia. Again, there are many railway gates throughout Australia requiring keepers, and very often post-offices are conducted by these gate-keepers. Billets such as these will be eminently suitable for our maimed soldiers, particularly where they are provided in districts where the men I ask the Treasurer have been bred and born. But, as the Act is now administered, if a man is granted a partial pension of £ 3 0 a year, should the post-office allowance and tbe rent of the cottage together amount to £50 a year, he would get no pension. The war pensions are administered, to all intents and purposes, on the same p r in ciple as the old-age pensions. I do not care what the position in l if e of a returned soldier may be, or what his income. If he has suffered loss, he is enI titled to his pension, irrespective of all other considerations. The pension should rest on his services to the country and the loss he has sustained. There might be cases where comparatively wealthy men would be entitled to the pension, if the Act were amended as I suggest, but if those men claimed the pension, the probabilities are that they would be only too glad to hand it over to some institution, which may be created in our midst, to help returned wounded soldiers who are in indigent circumstances. I do not think the drain on the Treasury would be very great, but if pensions were drawn to any extent by men of substance, some of tbe money would probably be used as an additional means of sustenance for those who were not in such fortunate circumstances. turned soldier who is able to work to-day may experience incapacity later. may come when a man, who is comparatively wealthy to-day, w ill be poor. The pension of a soldier who has fought for his country should be an inalienable right. There is no justification for taking away that pension, unless it had been granted for ill-health, which subsequently disappeared. Temporary invalidity is the only circumstance in which the pension should be withdrawn. I hope the Treasurer w ill accept some amendment in Committee which w ill terminate the present unjust system.

""When we were discussing the present ActI contended that the officers could not adminis. ter tbe Act according to the intention of Parliament, except in so f a r as that intention was expressed in the Act.

But even then the woman was granted, as a matter of courtesy, only the pension provided for a private, although her foster son had held the rank of lieutenant. minded view to take of her position. must recollect that Parliament had not provided a penny for this woman; the Treasurer acted more generously than Parliament had done. satisfactory to find that the Treasurer proposes to amend the law in that respect. When the original Act was before the House, honourable members discussed at some length the desirableness of placing a widowed mother on exactly the same position as the soldier's wife. A wif e is entitled to the f u l l pension, irrespective of her position and circumstances in life. Many of us hold the opinion that a widowed mother should be entitled to the same treatment, but this B ill leaves her in the same position as uuder the original Act. I hope that when we are dealing with that portion of the B ill in Oommitto the inclusion of widowed mothers amongst those who are classified as dependants. Under the existing law a widowed mother has to prove that previous to the war she was dependent on the T h a t was the faul t person who was killed, and she has also to state the extent of her dependence. The case was brought under my notice by tlie honourable member for Gippsland; and it appears that a mother, who had a little dairy farm, was helped in the management of it by her son, but it could not be proved that she was in any way dependent on him, as she received no money from him. The son was killed, and the mother refused a pension. I hope that, in view of these facts, the Government will be good enough to yield on the point. ThereI am glad that the honourable member for Richmond raised the question, because I feel very strongly regarding it . Whether a man, on his return, can or cannot do any work ought not to be taken into consideration. not to be on a charity basis. tion ought to be whether a man can earn I the equivalent of what he was able to earn before he went to the war. In the Riverina electorate, a young man who, prior to going to the war, was receiving £ 3 to £ 3 10s. a week as a chaffcutter, came back minus a leg, and, while it is certain he will never again be able to earn £ 3 10s. a week at his old occupaT h a t was a narrowtion, it has been decided that he is to receive a pension of only 10s., although thus handicapped for life. We ought not to rely on our good intentions, b u t have all the conditions set out in the Act itself. The House, I am sure, is very anxious However, it is that this measure shall be worthy of Australia.

116,Mr Thomas,"Quite so. The quesI wish to impress on the Grovernment the importance of dealing equitably with widowed mothers. the Government with not liberally in terpreting' the Act in many instances. As a matter of fact, the Government are not so much to blame, because when the question of war pensions was originally before us, the gravity of the position could not be thoroughly appreciated, and it was felt by all of us that the measure would have to be amended in the light of experience. In one case, in my electorate, a widowed mother was given the magnificent sum of 5s. a week, and the manner in which the amount was arrived at is somewhat curious. widowed mother with two sons, one single, and one married with a small family. the working classes w ill agree that, however willing a man may be, he is not always able to assist his mother if he has to do justice to his own wife and family. The single son, before he l e f t for the front, was paying his mother £ 1 a week; and the authorities calculated that, as it wouTd cost the mother 15s. per week to keep him, she was dependent on him to the extent of only 5s. I represented the case to the auDnorities, and managed to get the pension in creased to 10s., though I must say that I was like a beggar pleading at the gate. This young man, before he left for the front , was employed as a check clerk on the wharves at Adelaide; and as he was very often away from home at night, and had to purchase food outside, it really could not have cost his mother 15s. a week to keep him. Is this the sort of position the Government of Australia should take up ? There are two other cases in my electorate that I might cite, and they certainly show that the view taken by the authorities is a very narrow one. course, I do not blame those who have to administer tlie Act , for they must in terpret the law as they find it ; and when I was interviewing the authorities about the case of the widowed mother, I was referred to the Act as it was passed by Parliament. If the life of this young man had been spared, it is very possible that he might, in the future, have been able to give his mother considerably more than £ 1 per week. about the feeling of the Housei n the matter; and if the Treasurer would make be saved. I do not charge desire to see proper provision made in this B ill for widowed mothers, because several cases of hardship have been brought under my notice. In one home a son was paying his mother 15s. a week, and two sons at the f r o n t allowed her £ 1 7s. 6d. per week each. This woman let one of her rooms at 10s. a week, bringing her income up to £ 5 . One of her sons was killed on service, and this reduced her income to £ 3 12s. 6d., including the 10s. for the room. The rent of her house is £ 1 per week; and when she was asked why she did not go into a smaller house, She was a she, motherlike, replied, "" The house in which I live is just comfortable when my boys are at home, and I do not think I Those with any knowledge of should be asked to break up my household because they have gone on active service."" Now, because her income is £ 3 12s. 6d. a week, she has been refused the pension. Personally, I do not think that, under any circumstances, tlie 10s. she received for her room should have been taken into consideration in view of the rent she has to pay. Many of the youths who have gone Lo the f r o n t were paying their mothers £ 1 a week for their board, and the view taken by the authorities, if such a lad is killed, and his mother applies for a pension, is that 5s. a week is sufficient to allow her, because she was previously under an expense of 15s. per week in providing for her boy's keep. That is the system which has been in operation. I do not blame those who have been administering the Act . The oflicers with whom I have come into contact have been perfectly fair. The entire responsibility should rest on the members of this Parliament. When the War PensionsA c t was under consideration in this chamber, sufficient Of attention was not paid to it . We ought to remove all responsibility from the administrators of the Act, and shoulder it ourselves. We ought also to make the intention of this Parliament perfectly clear. There is just one other matter to which I'desire to draw attention. It is the case of a young man who had intended to enlist for active service. He >vas a member of the Citizen Forces, and just prior to the period when he contemplated There is no doubt enlisting, he was requested by the authorities to accept a position in the base hospital. .

He was warned of tiie danger that he would r u n hy accepting the position, but this knowledge did not deter him from doing what he conceived to be his duty. A t that time the authorities were experiencing a great difficulty in securing attendants for the hospital. This lad was the son of a widowed mother who was resident in the Prahran district. He accepted the position and entered the base hospital, where he discharged his duties for a period of four months. Finally, he contracted meningitis and died. 7Jhe circumstances of his case justified hia mother in applying for a pension. The authorities, however, practically refused consideration of her claim on the ground that her son had not enlisted, and, therefore, had not been on active service. I am of opinion-and I believe a majority of honourable members will agree with me-tlia t this young man in undertaking to fill a dangerous post of that kind, with a view to serving his country, was just as much entitled to consideration by this House as is a man who loses his life in the trenches. Asa matter of fact, I think that in accepting the position which he did, he in curred a greater risk than is incurred by men at the f r o n t . This particular case was brought under the notice of the M in ister. It was submitted to the Department presided over by the Treasurer, and finally the mother's claim was rejected, it being held that as the lad was not on active service at the time of his death she was not entitled to any pension. I held that provision should be made in this B ill that mothers similarly placed i u the f u t u r e shall receive some consideration. vice. suited for the work which he was performing? for such cases? vides that ""dependants"" means:The wife or widow of a person who is or has been a member of the Forces whose death or incapacity results from his employment in connection with warlike operations. A person engaged upon home service will not come under that provision. has something to do with warlike operations. The authorities have placed a very narrow interpretation upon the Act . the interpretation that has been placed upon it , and this B ill in its present form w ill not provide a remedy. Quite a large number of cases have been brought under my notice in which injustice has been in flicted upon widowed mothers. I believe that the difficulty would be overcome by inserting in the provision which I have quoted, after the word "" p e r so n "" the words "" or widowed mother of an unmarried person."" The honourable member for Gippsland has suggested that that amendment would cover the case of widowed mothers. I hope that the Treasurer will see his way clear to agree to an amendment which will deal effectively with this difficulty. I desire to compliment the Government upon having brought forward a B ill to liberalize the War Pensions Act. But I would point out that the schedule to this measure provides that a man who has lost both eyes shall receive the maximum pension for a period of only six months. I understand that in the different States there are blind institutions which are anxious to obtain control of blind soldiers, and to allow them 16s. per week for making baskets, &c. I am strongly of opinion that every soldier who has lost both eyes should receive the f u l l pension without any qualification whatever. When he returns, to this country we ought not to compel him to enter a blind institution and learn a trade. If he learns a trade, he should have all he can earn at it in addition to his penH e was on home sersion.

We all appreciate the difficulties of the financial position as placed before us by the Treasurer. He is the custodian of tlie public funds, and it was his duty to lay before honourable members the financial position, and to let us know what we are committing ourselves to. m the way of expenditure due to the war. But no financial obligation to which we have been committed so far, or are likely to be committed during the next twelve months, should prevent us from doing our duty to the soldiers who have fought for us who have stayed at home. I agree with the honourable member for Richmondi n the contention that men who have been to the front, and have suffered the injuries specified in the second schedule should, in no circumstances, have their pensions reduced. There is a clause to provide that, in the case of such men earning certain sums, there may be a reduction made in the pension paid to them. I think that that f rovision should be struck out of the B ill , do not know whether the second schedule specifies all the forms of in j u ry which would warrant a soldier getting the f u l l pension, but certainly those who suffer the injuries which are specified should suffer no reduction of the maximum pension proposed in such cases. I presume that, in framing the clause to which I take exception, tlie authorities considered the possibility later on of unfair competition by a soldier in receipt of a pension with a man who had to depend entirely upon his earnings from similar employment. I agree with the honourable member for Richmond that tlie f u l l pension proposed in such cases, three-fourths of the maximum, should be paid permanently to these injured men as something the community owes to them. One part of the B ill provides for payments to children, and I suppose that one of the most pathetic cases is that of a child whose father has been killed at the front , and whose mother has died. vides that a child shall receive 15s. per fortnight up to a certain age, and then on from 25s. to 30s. member not to discuss the details of the Bill. attention to what I consider the inadequacy of the provision made in this connection. I hope that when the Committee stage of the B ill is reached some increase in the pensions payable for children will be provided for. I cannot conceive the possibility of children being brought up on these small payments in the way in which the children of our soldiers, who die for us at the front , ought to be brought up. We should make adequate provision to give them as good a chance in life as is enjoyed by the children of any other person. Many instances in addition to those which have already been mentioned in this House of the position of the widowed mother of the soldier have been brought under my notice, and I am disappointed with the provision that is made in this B ill to meet such cases. I think that she should be placed in the same position as the widow of the soldier and the pension »should be granted to her permanently. She is f u l l y entitled to it and ought to have it . The many discussions which took place when we were considering the original B ill , and the definite promise of the Ministeri n charge that the case of the widowed mother of the soldier would receive sympathetic treatment, have not resulted in as satisfactory a provision for such cases as was anticipated. will recognise that a widowed mother, if without adequate means of support, will receive a pension. quote particular instances how, but I know of a case where a widowed mother was receiving reasonable assistance from her son's earnings to keep the household going before he went to the war. When he went to the f r o n t he made an allowance of as much as he possibly could to his mother to provide money for the housekeeping during his absence. He was killed at the war, and the result is that the mother is left with a sum from another of £ 1 per week, nearly the whole of which is absorbed in the payment of re'nt, and which is excluded from the Government pension. TheB ill proShe has now to tur n out to work, which she had not done for many years before, because her son provided the means for her support. Many such cases might be quoted, and it is disappointing I ask the honourable to find that they have not been given greater consideration.

The Minister has heard a good deal from honourable members, and I think he should tell us whether he intends to consider any of the suggestions which have been made. I shall be glad to do so. difficulties with which honourable members have to contend in Committee. If an honourable member desires some provision of the B ill to be altered he may have to sit here hour after hour.

A member who wishes to make some amendment in a B ill may leave the chamber for a smoke and find when he comes back that the B ill in which he was interested is through. He has of course to take the blame for that. When a soldier gets a pension it should not be taken away from him, no matter what his financial position becomes afterwards.

There w ill , doubtless, be malingerers,.who will profess to have sciatica or other complaints, which no doctorcan disprove. We are bound to get malingerers if we make the pension too liberal, but I would rather allow a small percentage of them to succeed than have theknowledge that one or two genuine cases had been unfairly treated.

But, on the other hand, we need to be careful that, in fixing limitations to prevent excesses of that kind, we do not leave too much power of modification to those who may be charged with the administration of the law. It is desirable that we should provide for those cases which even this measure, liberal as it is, will not embrace.

How much more so is ' it incumbent upon this Parliament to provide in a most liberal fashion for those who come back so maimed or afflicted as to be disabled from performing their ordinary work? cumbent . upon us to provide for the dependants of those who fought at the front . what has already been said by other members of tue House. speakers have given illustrations, and have shown tliat if we are to frame the PensionsB ill so as to meet the wishes of the House, it will be almost essential for the Treasurer to withdraw the present schedule, and to redraft another more in consonance with our opinions. If there is one thing on which members, independent of the side they sit on, are agreed upon; it is that we should provide for those who fight their country's battles. Can we be too liberal? I say no. as the finances of the country w ill admit. that even if the Treasurer told us that the finances of the country were in a deplorable condition, it would be absolutely essential for us to make ample provision for tliose who have fought the country's battles. The wealth of Australia is practically untouched as yet, and notwithstanding the burdens imposed by the war, such burdens as were never anticipated, we must stand by those who have gone to fight for us at the f r o n t . The Treasurer read out tlie list of pensions granted in Great Britain, Canada, and SouthA f r i c a , but he did not quote New Zealand, a country that is on all fours with Australia, and which, therefore, should have been quoted. The Treasurer may not know that the New Zealand pension scheme is far more liberal than that presented to us in the B ill before us to-day, and I ask him to have an analysis of the New Zealand schedule made, so that Australia may come up to the standard set in New Zealand. sure has been amended recently in order to liberalize its application and administration. fixing the schedule was assented to on the 5th August, 1915. The following, paragraphs from the definition of "" d e pendants "" show how far-reaching it is' in extending the benefit of pensionsA woman who becomes the wife of a member at any time before the expiry of twelve months after the date of his discbarge, and who satisfies the Board that at the date of the departure of the member from New Zealand there was a binding contract to marry subsisting between It is also in the member and such woman. A woman who becomes the wife of a member of the Forces at any time before the expiry of twelve months after the date of his discharge, I am not going to supplement and who satisfies the Board that she is the mother of a child born to the member before Almost all the the date of her marriage; that such child was born either before or within ten months after the departure of the member from New Zealand, and that the child was living at the date of her marriage to the member. Many young men have l e f t the country saying good-bye to sweethearts, and promising that if God spared them to come back they would enter into the bonds of matrimony. If within twelve months of his return or within twelve months of his discharge, a New Zealand soldier marries a young woman to whom he was engaged prior to leaving for the war, the wife, if subsequently widowed, is entitled to receive a pension. OurB ill actually reduces I go further, and say some pensions. The widow who now receives. £56 w ill , by the system of fortnightly payments, receive £ 5 5 .18s. The widow who now receives £ 6 4 w ill receive £ 6 3 14s. by the system of fortnightly payments. It is now proposed to pay to the widow £ 2 a fortnight, whereas in New Zealand she receives £ 2 10s. a fortnight. If we compare the two schedules, the New Zealand and the Australian, we find that there are certain gradations in the former which enable the dependants of well-paid officers to draw much higher pensions than we propose to pay, though I prefer our schedule in that regard. Our maximum pension is about £156 per annum to the widow, and a certain amount. for each child. In New Zealand the highest pension which a widow may draw is £ 3 5s. a week. I advise the Treasurer to compare the two schedules. We give the totally in-, capacitated soldier £ 3 per fortnight; New Zealand gives him £ 3 10s. per fortnight. We give the widow £ 2 per for t n i g h t; New Zealand gives her £ 2 10s. per fortnight.

Sitting {2.30] -This is largely a Committee B ill , and I do not propose to occupy much time in discussing it at this stage. I welcome a measure which makes a more generous allocation of funds for the purpose of making the pension scheme a success. figures quoted by the Treasurer this morning show very clearly that the increase in payments which is proposed, taken by itself, stands very favourably in relation to the war pensions of the United Kingdom and Canada. That is as it should be. We can better afford to be generous in these matters than can the people in the United Kingdom, and, having regard to all the social surroundings of our soldiers, a marked increase in the actual amounts of money devoted to pensions is only what we might expect. are paid a much higher rate of wages than are those in the United Kingdom, and just as the corresponding social obligations in Australia are in greater degree than those in the United Kingdom, so Ave should expect to find in any scheme propounded for meeting those obligations the more liberal provision which is made in this B ill . A comparison of ihe rates mentioned by the Treasurer shows that that standard is kept in view. Accordingly, I find that the Treasurer is introducing an increase of 50 per cent, on the pension of the lowest paid in the schedule. A f t e r all, that is Ihe unit of the whole scheme.

A widow with three children would get only £ 1 15s. per week, but she would not have her husband to keep and nurse. Those rates cannot be called a poverty stricken pension. Sacrifices have to be made in war, and this pension is f a r more liberal than the Canadian or Imperial one. As the Treasurer is proposing a 50 per cent, increase on the existing rates, I suggest that we might abide by that proposal. Tnis is not a law of the Medes and Persians, for it can be altered at any time Just as our workmen if it be found insufficient. We hope, however, that, at the close of the war, the cost of living will revert to something like its old proportions, in which case tlie pension provided in. the B ill would not be regarded as inconsiderable. We ought to treat these men as liberally as we possibly can, but, on the otlier hand, we should have some regard for the financial commitments of the oommonwealth as a whole. The Tieasurer's proposal for a 50 per cent, increase represents a substantial advance. Some of what I call the basic principles in connection with pensions are not being altered very much. I remember when the original measure was before the House stressing the point that a pension should not be regarded as a charitable allowance.

Above all, everything depends on the administration, and this may turn out to be much less generous than the B ill , on the face of it, would lead us to expect. I do not know whether any change is proposed in the administration-whethe r it is still to be lef t to one Chief Pensions Commissioner. If so, I am afrai d the administration w ill be very rigid, as it is at present, and give rise to a whole crop of anomalies. have seemed rigid, because of the maximum allowance. ferring to is the relation of the soldier to his dependants, and so on.

It is difficult, I know, to ascertain just what the amount of dependency is; and it seems to me that there is in the B ill a lack no husband coming home, but who still of proportion which, I am afraid, may cause a great deal of trouble. In my judgment, the pensions ought to adhere to certain dependants by right, no matter what the surrounding circumstances may be. Give the Commissioner the fullest possible discretion and range of judicial action within the principles laid down in the B ill . to be framed on such lines as to make it perfectly clear that the pension is tied to the soldier and his dependants, to be theirs under any circumstances that may arise hereafter. As I have said, when a woman marries again, she ought to have the pension because she has earned it-becaus e it has been l e f t and given to her. Having regard to the great needs of population in the country in the future, we ought to give every encouragement to widows to marry again and produce offspring in the land. However, we ought to support the Treasurer in the attitude he has taken up, and agree for the time being to regard this measure as a very just, as well as a generous, addition to the scheme as originally propounded. not say that I am altogether pleased with this effort of the Government to do something generous and kind. The Leader of the Opposition appears to be "" straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel,"" inasmuch as he is anxious that, when a widow finds some one to take the responsibility of finding her a home, she shall continue to receive a pension earned for her by her first husband. It must be observed, however, that this provision applies, not only to widows, but to other dependants, and it may be a daughter or other relative who receives the pension for two years after marriage to another who has sworn at the altar to provide for them. This is a proposal that I opposed on the last occasion, and I shall oppose it again. However, the generosity of the B ill is shown in the second schedule, which raises the pension of the soldier from £ 1 to £ 1 10s. a week. If a man returns so incapacitated as to be a drag on his wife, she will get 50 per cent, of the pension, and an allowance for her children; and, no doubt, this is an increase. But w ill tlie Treasurer, or any one else, point out where there is any increase in tlie other schedule ? How much increase is granted to the widow who has has children to keep? I cannot regard it as generosity to give a woman with one child 25s. per week. The movement which I support claims a living wage for the worker; and when the head of the house is removed by death or disablement a living wage ought to be given to his dependants. No one will say that 25s. per But tlie measure ought week is even approximate to a living wage. There is going to be much poverty as the result of the war, and it is the poor widow who will suffer. It ought to be kept in mind that this is an industrial measuretliat 90 per cent, of those who get the pensions will be drawn from the industrial section of the community, and that the amount paid in their case is the lowest. If I thought I were powerful enough to get a following, I would lump the whole of this expenditure together, strike a general average, and provide pensions on a flat rate, so that the worker's wife or widow should not be handicapped as compared with the officer's wife or widow.

We hear plenty of talk about generosity to our soldiers; but what will he the lot of a widow with three "" kiddies "" on the magnificent sum of £ 1 15s. per week ? It is not even as much as the sum usually granted in ex-nuptial cases, coming out at about half-a^crown less for a child. terminates at the age of sixteen. provides that children without parents are to be allowed 10s. per week, so that a person who receives them will receive twice as much as the widow with a child. Why this difference? . there is no reason for it , and much reason why it should not be permitted. When the previous measure was before us, many honourable members fought strenuously for more generous treatment for widowed, mothers; and I , for one, was then, and I . am now, convinced that, once a widowed mother has proved her dependency, there should be no question as to how much shall be paid. If a soldier has earned ai pension for his widowed mother, it is hers by right. As a matter of fact, a widowed mother is at a disadvantage, because there are hundreds of soldiers who have married and lef t for the f r o n t without a chance of there being any issue of the marriage. She is to be granted a pension for two years after she has married again. Yet the mother of a son who is killed in action is to have her pension whittled down in the manner that has been stated by honourable members upon this side of the House. I hope that the widowed mother w ill be granted the f u l l pension that has been earned for her by the son whom she has lost. I am not pleased with the generosity of this B ill . I shall never be satisfied until the nation has f u l l y discharged its debt to our soldiers who have fought the battle of the Empire. I submit that, neither they nor their dependants should be dealt with on a charitable basis, whilst the patriots who will banquet our boys when they return, who will wave flags and wear buttons, are allowed to draw 4£ per cent, upon the money which they subscribe to our war loans. Treasurer has stated that the £9,000,000 required for deferred pay w ill be an additional burden. Evidently we have not got to the end of our borrowing orgy yet. He also stated that more money will bave to be raised to enable the States to settle soldiers on the land. I say that the time is coming wben the workers w ill curse those who led us into this war. But now that the war is with us the least we can do is to see that the proletariat, who w ill be the chief sufferers by it , receive decent pensions for the sacrifices which tliey have made. as this B ill provides more liberal pensions for the dependants of our soldiers, I heartily welcome it . A t the same time, I regret that we should be compelled to deal witli it in a hurried manner when there is absolutely no necessity for it . We are not now at the end of the year. There is plenty of time before us. J n otlier In my opinion, circumstances, we could have discussed this B ill leisurely, and with a view to doing even-handed justice all round. I have not yet had time to read the measure and to compare it with the pension schemes tliat obtain in other countries, or with our old-age and invalid , pension schemes, and with the machinery that is provided' in those measures. The honourable member for Parramatta has complained of the rigidity with which our war pensions scheme is administered. That is due to the fact that no discretion is vested in the Commissioner. Some time ago I brought under the notice of the ex-Treasurer the case of a widowed mother, and, in reply, he said that the B ill would be administered sympathetically. I need hardly point out that the amount of sympathy with which it is administered depends entirely on the discretion that is vested in the Commissioner. If he is permitted no discretion, lie can extend no sympathy in respect of any claim. I repeat that this is a B ill which we should have had ample time to consider, with a view to formulating amendments for the purpose of improving it . It is perfectly true-as has been pointed out by the Treasurer-that we must study our finances. But we have something which we ought to consider before that. Our primary consideration should be to provide for those who have suffered and died for us, and who have left, dependants behind them. Whatever allowance we may make to them or their The dependants' will be abundantly justified if we come out of this war safely.

I have in my mind at present-some honourable member for Maribyrnong-the cases in which widows entirely dependent pensions scheme in the latter country is upon the earnings of their sons, who have much preferable in that it provides that been either killed in action or incapacithe wife of a private, a gunner, a lancetated, have been reduced to the lowest corporal, a sapper, or a drummer who is condition of penury, and have been unkilled, should receive a pension of 25s. able to obtain any relief. I submit that cases of this kind should be considered in connection with a B ill of this character. They are really in the worse position of all dependants, especially where they have young children to look after, and are in such a condition of ill-health as to be unable to provide by their own labour for their offspring. Several instances of this description have come under my notice, and it has been a sad experience to me to be unable to hold out to them any hope of inducing the country to recognise that they are the victims of this cruel war. I sincerely trust that in Committee any suggestions which may be made with a view to liberalizing the provisions of the B ill will be sympathetically received, by the Treasurer. Unfortunately, our experience has been that whenever amendments' -n o matter how innocent they may have been-hav e emanated from the Opposition side of the Chamber, they have almost in covert acts of hostility towards the B ill itself or towards the Government.

The second schedule to that Act sets out that a wounded private-and here I would stress the fact that the measure does not discriminate according to the nature of the injuries received-shoul d receive £ 1 15s. per week, and that his wife should get 12s. 6d. per week and or a maximum of £ 3 12s. 6d. This shows that New Zealand has gone further than we have. ablement. does not say total disablement. is nothing in that measure discriminating between the loss of an eye and tlie loss of two eyes, or between the loss of an arm and the loss of two arms. I would like the Treasurer to bring his B ill into conformity with the New ZealandA c t by abolishing all discrimination. A man who loses an arm may have been an artisan. He is no longer in a position to follow his usual occupation, and the chances are that our meagre pension of 10s. a week will send him on to the streets begging. When our soldiers were asked to volunteer it was not the intention of the people of Australia that they should be compelled to go out on the streets and beg. Then take the case of widowed mothers. A t present they have to prove that they were solely dependent on their sons, but I think that they should be placed in the same position as the widowed wife. A widowed mother who has given her son or her sons, on whom she was dependent, has a right to f u l l consideration and f u l l compensation. For that reason I shall support those who will move in Committee to amend tlie B ill in this direction. Further, I think that the portion of the measure referring to the second schedule should be deleted. the Treasurer will notify that it is the intention of the Government to place the widowed mother in the same position as the widowed wife, I have no more to say; but I wish to put forward one or two potent facts. There is always the possibility of the young widow being able to supplement her pension by earnings, or she may re-marry, but when an aged mother in her declining years has the [298] news brought home to her that her only breadwinner has been killed, tlie blow is a great one. The time during which she would be on the pension list would be very short. The Treasurer would be meeting the wishes of both sides of the Housei f he granted this request, and removed from widowed mothers a great deal of anxiety, and, possibly, suffering. each child 5s. per week, [3.18] I am sorry that I cannot give way in everything to those honourable members who have pressed for more generous consideration. the wasters, and give the money to the widowed mothers. who plead that the Bill should be made more generous to remember our financial obligations, which will be very heavy after the war, and, indeed, during the war. For the information of those honourable members who were not in the chamber this morning, and who are pressing for more generous treatment in the matter of pensions, let me say that the war loans will amount to £109,000,000 by June, 1917, and we cannot see the end of the war yet. In fact, each year the war lasts we may anticipate having to borrow £50,000,000, which means an additional annual charge of '£2,500,000 for interest to be made up out of taxation. Even' after the war ends it will take two years to bring our soldier's back, during which time we shall have tQ pay them. Therefore, we shall need to borrow money after the war ends, and we shall have to pay in terest and sinking f u n d on that further borrowing; and as that interest and sinking f u n d will have to come out of our resources in some way, to that extent there will be further taxation.

While a colonel receives £2 18s. a week, the widow of a colonel, probably a healthy young widow, receives £ 3 3s. a week.

The effect was that many wellto-do widows were entitled to claim the pension as a r i g h t ; hut honourable members agreed that, no matter whether a woman was rich or not, her position as a widow entitled her to a pension as a right. Now we seek to give the same right to the ""widowed mother of the unmarried son. a pension, surely the widowed mother of an unmarried son is ' equally entitled to one. forward this B ill was the party which brought in the Maternity Allowance Act. Under that Act, the Government pay a maternity allowance to a woman whether she be as poor as Lazarus or as rich as Croesus, provided that she has gone through the act of motherhood. the Government) do not propose to abolish that pension, despite all the financial difficulties of whicli the Treasurer ' has spokeu. I think they did right in making that provision in the Act ; but if motherhood is recognised in that way in one Act, surely when a mother has spent many years of care and trouble in rearing a boy, who has become endeared to her, and between whom and herself no other woman stands, and she gives her son to his country and he is killed-surely , I say, she ought to have the same right to recognition as his widow would have had had he been married, especially as in the majority of cases the mother would be much older than the widow. The widowed mothers must be fewer than the widows, and the length of time for which they would claim pensions would naturally be shorter. withstanding the burden of loans and war expenses, the Government propose to continue the pensions payable to a rich female dependant, even for two years after she has married another man. The attitude of the Government on this question seems to be inconsistent. This, matter was discussed so warmly last year that I thought the Government might have been prepared by this time to tell members how many unmarried sons of widowed mothers have joined the Forces, so that we might judge of the possible effect upon the finances of the amendment I am proposing. I hope the amendment will be allowed to go to the vote, and if the Committee is prepared to make the suggested provision the Government [298]3 The House agreed unaniwill be absolved from any responsibility for the consequences. My own view is that, no matter what the financial responsibility of the country may be, we sliould deal justly and generously with every person who suffers by this war, and every woman who makes a sacrifice by the loss of one who is near and dear to her. If the widow is entitled to The widowed mother does not receive the consideration which is her due. I mentioned to the Treasurer this morning the The party bringing case of a widow who has two sons serving at the front , each of whom was making her an allowance of £ 1 7s. 6d. per week.

Her And whole income while the two sons at the f r o n t were alive was £ 4 . One son was killed, and her income was thus reduced by £ 1 7s. 6d. per week, leaving a balance of £ 2 12s. 6d., out of which she had to pay £ 1 per week for rent. Her net income was then £ 1 12s. 6d. per week, upon which she was expected to maintain herself and other children who were dependent upon her. the sons after they enlisted, or had they beencontributing prior to enlistment. living with their mother, and subscribing to the up-keep of the home. she had been dependent upon those sons prior to their enlistment, she would be entitled to a pension. quoted should be sufficient proof that the comfort of herself and the younger children was partly dependent on the contribution of the son who had been killed,. and that her remaining income was not sufficient. a mistake. take. I appealed to the Treasury Department, and received the same reply as the widow had received, namely, that she was not entitled to a pension. If a widow in tliose circumstances is not entitled to a pension under the existing Act an amendment is necessary.

People ask, "" Why should we allow our sons to go to the f r o n t if we are to receive the same treatment as So-and-so has received."" I have said to many people that, whatever anomalies exist in the present Act will be removed when Parliament has the opportunity. tlie Treasury for particulars of the case at once. According to tlie terms of the present Act, and I believe the Commissioners have interpreted it accurately, the amount of the pension granted depends entirely upon the financial position of tlie dependant. That should not be so. The pension should be claimed as a right. On the 29th July, 1915, when the PensionsB ill was under consideration in this chamber, I moved an amendment to clause 7 which, in my opinion, would have met all these cases In assessing the rate of pension due to a dependant, the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner shall assess it at a rate not less than the amount contributed by the member for the support of the dependant during the period of twelve months prior to his death or being incapacitated, provided that such assesssacrifices so great. ment shall not exceed the amount specified in column 2 of the schedule opposite to the rate of pay of the member. If that amendment had been adopted, it would have obviated many of the difficulties that confront us at the present time. On a previous occasion I mentioned in the House the case of a clergyman who enlisted and was killed. When his widow claimed a pension, she was, I understand, denied any rights, on the ground that she was receiving another pension from some clergy provident f u n d , equal to the amount claimed from the Commonwealth.

At present, if the neighbours and friends of a widowed mother put her into a small business, sufficient to bring her in £ 1 a week, that widowed mother loses her pension rights altogether. ThisI do not think is r i g h t ; nor do I think it was the intention of honourable members when the Act was passed. Personally, I wish to see the pension made the right of bhe . individual, apart altogether from financial standing. MrW .

So far from being a dole, it is a right which the country owes to those people who have made No monetary payment could in any sense recompense them for those sacrifices, and the least the country can do is to make the best recompense possible. It would save much discussion if the Treasurer would inform the Committee whether or not it is the intention of the Government to go on operating the Act in this way. If so, we shall know exactly where we stand, and can make any alteration we desire. If , however, it is the intention of the Government to alter the administration of the Act on the lines suggested, I shall be very glad to know the fact. [3.50] I agree with the proposed addition to the clause, because I have long thought that some amendment of the kind is absolutely necessary.

I may say that this case was on all-fours with another, of which this woman had heard, and in which a pension had been refused, and she was at first reluctant to make any application. However, she was persuaded to do So, with the result I have stated. Is that a state of things which meets with the approval of the Treasurer? Are we to perpetuate an Act which can have such results? If so, it will spoil an otherwise liberal recognition of the services which these gallant men have given the country. I take it that such instances as I have given might be multiplied a hundredfold; but I do not wish to dwell on the matter, because I tliink the Oommittee is nretty well agreed regarding it . We give a maternity allowance to a mother who brings a child into the world, as a recognition of motherhood; and shall we refuse that mother a pension after she has reared her boy to manhood and given him to the country? I am quite in agreement with the honourable member for Richmond, who urges that these pensions should not be regarded as charitable doles. It w ill be a pity if such a thing enters the mind of the community. A pension of this kind is a solemn pledge and duty that the Government of a country owe to the mothers who have given their sons in the national defence. It is a bounden obligation on the Parliament and the country to duly recognise the sacrifice that these mothers have made. As I have said, if something of the kind suggested is not done, an otherwise good B ill w ill be spoiled. The position now is that the Treasurer is quite willing to give a soldier's widow a pension for two years after her re-marriage, although she may marry a millionaire. If that provision were cut out, I fancy we should be satisfied. The Treasurer has spoken about our financial position, but if the Treasury is in straitened circumstances here is a direction in which money could be saved and devoted to the better purpose. MrW . ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [3.55] -When the previous measure was before the House, I asked the Government to give sympathetic consideration to a proposal similar to that now made, and I hope the Treasurer will now see his way to accede to it . The trouble in Bills of this kind, and clauses of this kind, is that they are apt to be regarded as measures of poor relief, and this is not as it should be. This is a PensionsB ill , and its provisions ought to be made with the object of pensions in view. If the receipt of a pension is to be made contingent on the 'poverty. of the person receiving it , the whole character of the pension is destroyed, and I have complained frequently about this blot on our old-age pensions scheme. I should be very sorry to see the blot perpetuated in this B ill , now that we have the chance to remove it , and the clause might be amended in the direction suggested, with great improvement to tlie measure. Such an amendment would certainly have the effect of inspiring confidence in mothers who have sons eligible for service, but who, in the fear that they may be thrown on the charity of the world, withhold their consent to their sons enlisting. There is no doubt that the absence of some provision of the kind acts as a very serious deterrent to some young men who, anxious as they may bo to serve their country, yet are fearfu l to offer, in case, should any accident happen to themselves, their widowed mothers may be reduced to circumstances of penury, and become dependent on charity. As I have said previously, cases have come under my notice in which comparatively young and delicate mothers, between thirty four and forty-five yeairs of age, w it h small families to support, have sons, mere youths under twenty, at the front , who, before joining, were contributing to the support of the household. The death of sons in such cases has deprived the mothers of support, with most harrowing results. I have sent one or two of the cases on for the consideration of the Department of Defence, but I am sorry to say that I have not even received any acknowledgment of my letter, mucn less an assurance that, anything will be done. This deiay, of course, may be due to the pressure of business, and much correspondence of a similar nature. Now, however, we have presented to us an opportunity to make legal provision for instances of the kind, thus rendering it unnecessary to write resultless letters to the omcers of the Department, whose time at present is taken up with cases of hardship that should be provided for when such measures as this are before us. I hope that the Treasurer w ill sympathetically consider the amendment. the Treasurer cannot stand out against the wish of both sides of the Committee in a matter of this kind ? He must have too great an opinion of his position in connection with the functions of representative government to oppose the unanimous wish of honourable members. The honourable gentleman talks about the great obligation that we are incurring in regard to the war, and, of course, that is a very natural view for a Treasurer to take. He ought to remember, however, that these pensions represent one of the very smallest obligations that we are likely to face. The number of such pensions will be very few indeed, and I can suggest to him a way in which he could find the means to finance thema very ready method of finding the necessary money. The Ministerial motor cars represent an expenditure of about £2,000 a year. discussing Ways and Means. Way by which the proposal made to the Committee may be financed. not be discussed now. There is a proposal before the Chair to amend the clause by the insertion of certain words. The discussion must be confined to that. ing to a difficulty which has been raised by the Treasurer. wish to pursue the subject any further. I have given the honourable gentleman the cue if he chooses to follow it up. Amendment agreed to. move That the words "" within five years,'' in paracases were just receiving the benefit of graph (e), be left out. I consider that no disqualification should be placed upon the parents of men who are serving at the front. under review provides that, in the event of parents falling into indigent circumstances within five years after a son has been killed in battle they shall be entitled to a pension, but that beyond that period they shall not be eligible to receive it . To my mind, that is a very serious handicap to impose on the parents of lads who are serving with the colours to-day. We all know that some families have two or three sons at the front. Only yesterday I received a letter from a parent who has three sons there. He has to maintain at home three or four other children who are unable to support themselves. These are dependent upon the father, who is in in different health, but who is still able to follow his employment; bub from all appearances he may not be able to continue in his occupation for any great length of time. Should his health remain good for five years after one of his sons has fallen at the front, he will be disqualified from receiving a war pension. Now, considering that this pension is considerably more than either the old-age or the invalid pension, why should the parents of sons who have served their country and fallen in battle have to depend upon those smaller pensions? To what will the provision in the B ill be likely to lead ? Wheni t becomes known to aged fathers who have lost a son in the war that they w ill not be able to secure a pension unless they apply for it within five years after the We are not now death of that son, will they not say"" I could continue working for a year or two I am pointing out a and qualify for the old-age or invalid! pension; but considering that if I cease work now I can obtain the war pension, T h a t question canwhich is two or three times as much.

The parents in many those wages. They were in a position to save something out of their son's earnings; but if one of those sons has the misThe clause fortune to lose his life at the front, they will have been deprived of those earnings.

A t present if a widow is in receipt of £52 and the total pension allowable under the Act is £52, she is entitled to no pension. I do not wish to see the Act operated in that way. The' dependant's monetary position should not be taken into consideration. [4.19] -Privat e income is not taken into oonsideratiou. A widow will receive her pension no matter what her private income may be. I cannot satisfy the honourable member in regard to the other point he has raised. A soldier may have allotted his pay to this one or to that one -to his girl or his friend. thing in that regard. honourable member's claim was that the measure of dependence should be determined by tlie allotment of the pay. tion on dependence provided in the Bill. I have not asked that we should go outside tliat limitation. widow or children claim dependence, they must prove to have been dependent on the soldier for twelve months prior to his going to the war. We cannot open the door any further in that regard. graph (iii) of sub-section 1 of section 8 provides that all dependants except the widow and children must have their pensions assessed by the Commissioner. A widowed mother will be included in this category, and I consider it distinctly unfair. The mother who has reared, a son only to find that he has become food for bullets may have had great possibilities from that son had it not been for this war. He may have risen to great things. Therefore I hope that the Treasurer will be generous, and that he will delete this restriction on widowed mothers, and not leave her pension to be assesged by the Commissioner.

The widowed mother of an unmarried son will be put on an equal position to that of the widow, and will receive a pension in accordance with the second column of the schedule. [4.24] -We should be fair all round. There is a percentage of women whose husbands have deserted them, leaving them to rear families. Many have secured divorces, but many are what are commonly known as grass widows. They have all the responsibilities of widows, and no stretch of imagination is required to place them on the same footing as widowed mothers. In my opinion, they should be treated just tlie same as widowed mothers in the matter of pensions. Many of them are worse off than widows, because they are not free to remarry, and there is always a certain amount of stigma attaching to their positions. I trust that the Treasurer will be able to place them on the same footing as widowed mothers in regard to a claim to a pension. thought that the Treasurer would have made some statement with regard to the case mentioned by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. The woman whose husband has deserted her and who has had to bring up a family should not be treated any differently to the widowed mother. A t any rate, these women should not be placed in a worse position than they were before the war, which is the basis of our war pensions scheme. Honourable' members should give some consideration to devising means by which justice can be done in this direction. I hope the Treasurer will be able to intimate that the justice which has been secured for the widowed mother will be extended to the mother whose husband has deserted her. The honourable member for Perth made a suggestion this morning with which I heartily concur. There are for ever cropping up the cases of deserted wives and others who have claims equal to anybody else enumerated in the Bill. We might cover all such claims by inserting in the Bill a clause giving discretionary power to the Minister or the officers administering the Act to consider sympathetically any such case. gulations too wide. whose husbands have deserted them. probably when this Act again comes forward for consideration there will be a crop of other cases of hardship before us, and all those people will have to suffer between now and any further amendment of the law. A discretionary clause such as I suggest would meet all cases of hardship. to officials. plaint that, owing to the rigid framing of the Act, officers have not been able to do justice in some cases only by actually violating the terms of it .

If such discretionary power could be allowed in one Act, it could be allowed in another. we can now, and have a discretionary power in addition. that. My point is that the Act should be elastic enough to cover all cases of hardship. Amongst the men who have enlisted are some who have certain rights under old Defence Acts. By enlisting they have forfeited those rights, whereas if they had remained in Australia and met with an accident in connection with their duties they would have been entitled to a greater recompense than the war pensions will provide. Will the Treasurer say whether the wording of this clause will preclude any claims of the kind being submitted in the future ?

265,Mr Chaelton (Hunter) [4.36],"I f2 provides that in the case of the loss of a leg or foot, the maximum rate of pensiou shall be payable for six months, and thereafter three-fourths of the maximum rate; in the case of loss of hand or arm, the maximum. rate for six months, and thereafter three-fourths of the maximum rate; loss of one. eye, half of the maximumrate; loss of both legs, or both feet, or both arms, or both hands, or of arm and leg, or of hand and foot, or of both eyes, or of one eye together with loss of leg, foot, hand, or arm, the maximum rate for at least six months, and thereafter subject to reduction to seven-eighths of the maximum rate if, and so long as, the member is capable, of earning, at least 6s. a week. It is not fair to provide that a man who suffers the loss of an arm or leg should not get his pension for all time. So far as the second portion of the schedule is concerned, will anybody say that there should be any reduction of the pension to a man who has lost both legs or both hands, or both eyes? Wliy should his pension, be reviewed after six months ? If there is. any man who should receive the maximum pension, it should be one who has suffered in that way. sion takes place only if the pensioner earns money. a week, his pension is reduced. surer) [4.40] -May I explain that in cases of loss of both feet, or both arms, or both eyes, or of one eye together with a loss of a hand or arm, the Government will propose an amendment to strike out of the second schedule the limitation as to time, so that the schedule will read that the pensioner shall be entitled to the maximum amount without any diminution. In regard to the first portion of the schedule, honourable members must have become acquainted with many cases in which a man has not been greatly disadvantaged by the loss of one eye. Many people use only one eye because of the other being slightly defective or untrained. Theref6re, the loss of an eye does not totally disable a man from earning hisliving. The Bill provides that in such a case the man shall have half the maximum pension for the rest of his life; The arguments of the honourable member for Hunter are not so strong in regard to that portion of the schedule as in regard to the cases in which there has. been a loss of two limbs. Eveni f the schedule is amended as suggested, the position will be very much the same, because proposed new sub-section 3 provides-^ The amount of pension granted and payable to a member of the Forces shall not be reduced within the period of six months from the date of the commencement of the pension. Why should the amount of pension be reduced at all ? Though we may amend the schedule, it will be open to the Board at ""any time to review any pension, so than, even if a man were permanently disabled, he might find his payments reduced. What is required is an amendment providing that, in the case of recipients who are incapacitated by reason of the disabilities specified in the second, schedule, those disabilities shall be deemed to be permanent, and the full pension paid. [4.47] I assure the honourable member that if the amendment I propose does not meet the case, our legal advisers shall go through the Bill, so. that provision may be made, when the Bill is in tlie Senate, to insure that soldiers are entitled to the rights specified in the second schedule. surer's assurance. my opinion, the allowance in the case of children is quite inadequate. It is noticeable that, while the pensions have been increased for the soldier, there is no increase so far as the widow is concerned. An amendment, puts the widowed motheiin the same position as the widow, and,, therefore, I suppose my chance of gettingany increase in the case of the widow isreduced. Under the circumstances, I think we might well take into consideration the advisability of increasing the allowance on account of children. It maybe that a widow left without children, and z-eceiving £1. per week,, is not so badly off, though, personally, I think she isunderpaid; but where a widow has children, an allowance of 5s. each week i * almost contemptuous. It means that a widow with two children is paid 30s. on which to keep them and herself.

If the Treasurer cannot see his way to increase tlie allowance to 10s. per week in the case of a child, he might at least make I accept your sugi t 7s. 6d. per week. I know that he is just as sympathetic with the dependants of soldiers as are th© rest of us, b u t he has to look at all proposals from a revenue stand-point. It is, however, possible to pay too much attention to considerations of revenue. I should have liked to have seen an increased pension granted to the widows of soldiers who died at Gallipoli. But, of course, the hardship imposed as the result of losing tlii* bread-winner of the family is not so great in some cases as it is in others, and if we started to mak© allowances on a graduated scale, w© should not know where we should end. However, I am of opinion that an increased grant should be made in the case of children. the Treasurer cannot accept the amendment of th© honourable member fox Batman, I hope that he will compromise on the matter by agreeing to an allowance of 15s. per fortnight being paid in the case of children.

There is lighting, for instance. for larger families. small children are reared in small houses. My point is that we might give consideration to a scale of allowances for children, say, 17s. 6d. a fortnight instead of 10s. for the first child; 15s. a fortnight in stead of 10s. for the second; and 10s.

I ask the Treasurer to consider the unanimous opinion of honourable members that the proposed allowance to children is not sufficient. A widow with one child has to pay at least 10s. rent for a room. What, then, is left to support her and her child? I would rather see other allowances cut down and more given to the children. In regard to what the Treasurer has said, we must do our duty here, irrespective of what funds are raised outside. If people can get assistance from other funds, it w ill bring a little more comfort and cheer to the home; but we have our duty to perform, and I would allow 10s. for each child. If we cannot persuade the Treasurer to agree to that amount, I hope that he will consider the question of making the allowance 7s. 6d. surprised to hear the Treasurer say that these people should go to the repatriation funds. say so. they should go to these funds for what they needed. I have known several people who have had to seek assistance from these funds. They experienced considerable trouble, and had to apply four or five times. In the case of one widow, a Vigilance Committee had to apply four or five times before it could get anything from the Australia Day Fund, and then all that they received was another 5s. a week to supplement the 5s. which the widow was already receiving. We should I not drive these dependants from pillar to post. We should recognise the sacrifice that our soldiers have made, and the greatest sacrifice of all is that of the married man who has lef t wife and children behind him. We should, at least, see that his children are well provided for, and, goodness knows, a payment of 7s. 6d. per week is little enough. I should like to see it 10s.; but as the Treasurer is very obdurate and will not bend, I am willing to compromise the matter and agree to 7s. 6d. a week. As the honororable member for South Sydney has pointed out, many of these women have to pay fro m 10s. to 12s. a week for a room; and as a woman'with one child receives The funds they are adminisonly £ 1 for herself and 5s. for the child, she has only 13s. to 15s. a week on which to provide food and clothing and educate the child. The. Treasurer has said that a woman can do some work; but if the child is very young, who is to look after it? As a matter of fact, we should not ask these women to work.

311,Mr Fowled,"That is undoubtedly8308 in connection with the war, that we might very well increase the allowance for children from 5s. to even 10s. w i th the consciousness that we were not adding very materially to the total cost. Even if we gave the maximum increase suggested, it would amount to only a few thousands, and these a diminishing figure. I quite agree with honourable members who emphasize the' advantage of being reasonably generous in a matter of this kind, and with those who remind us that, of all the assets of a nation after a. cruel war, the most precious is that of the children. We should be failing in our responsibility to the widowed mothers if we denied them the means to make their children useful citizens of Australia. MrW . ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [5.50] I heartily support the proposal that has been made, for,' whatever happens, we ought to look after the "" kiddies,"" who are the most deserving of sympathetic consideration. hope tliat the Treasurer will pay due regard to the requirements of those innocent little victims of the ""unfortunate national peril which has deprived them of their bread-winners. It would be some comfort, at any rate, to mothers to know that their children will be provided for rather more generously than hitherto, and it will be only in accordance with a desire of honourable members if the Treasurer could say he will liberalize the provision made in this regard. [5.52] I feel disposed to adhere to the principle of 10s. for each child, and I hope that those who are of the same way of thinking will not give way. The Treasurer has saidI think I quote him correctly-that he thinks a mother might be able to "" earn something."" proper way to regard a mother who is left without a breadwinner-is as being unable to earn anything. dustrial life, and breadwinners have been lost, but widows and children are left for whom no provision is made. the case we are considering the mothers and children have made the supreme sacrifice in the interests of their country.

It would be simp]y awful if we were to allow these mothers to be dependent upon the world for a crust. We ought not to look for examples from New Zealand or elsewhere, but, on the contrary, set an example to the rest of the world. I suppose that £ 3 per week may be taken to be the average wage of au artisan in this country, and a wife, and one child with that income have hitherto felt assured of it so long as the husband was alive. When that husband gives up his life for his country, we shall, unless some alteration is made, reduce that woman's income to 25s. per week, and ask her to regard it as a return for the noblest and greatest sacrifice she can make. It is all very well to talk, with our tongues in our cheeks, about the noble sacrifice these men and women are making, but how can we possibly turn round and tell such a woman that we I sincerely propose to reduce her income by 35s. per week? I hope the Treasurer will adopt no half-way course, but set an example to all other countries. much pleasure in identifying myself with honourable members who are endeavouring to induce the Treasurer to increase the children's allowance to 7s. 6d. if 10s. is not obtainable. In common with other honourable members.

In one case, several men in Queensland asked me whether they should apply for an appointment that was advertised, and when I saw the Commissioner he told rae that every one's claims were considered, and that the men should send in their applications.

To-night, of course, the Ministry are in a very unfortunate position, seeing that they appear to be in a very large minority. As I say, it is peculiar that an endeavour should be made to extract a promise that the Government would not do anything under any circumstances; and it is not a fair position into which to put a Ministry. I believe we ought to have a Public Service Commissioner, though I do not say there is nothing in the Act, or in the powers of the Commissioner, that ought not to be reconsidered. to keep free from political appointment. help members if political appointments were again the practice! Asi t is, I have many "" patients"" in a day, b u t I should then have them a hundredfold. These efforts to extract a promise are not made by members of the Opposition, but by members of the Government side. I do not think, myself, that this B ill gives power to do away with the Commissioner, but, even so, we ought to be satisfied with the assurance that nothing will be done in this regard without consulting the House. The Leader of the Opposition is nothing if not astute; and I do not wish to allow to pass without comment that honourable member's closing sentence, wherein he said that he was happy to have the assurance of the Leader of the House that it was not proposed to alter the practice of having a Commissioner. I think I am correctly interpreting the Leader of the House when I say that he did not commit himself either one way or the other in regard to the policy of the Government. I do not propose, under this B ill , to discuss the standing of the Commissioner, because I think that is irrelevant to the measure. TheB ill is designed to continue the present position, with the exception that tlie Public Service Commissioner has retired, and that we have to appoint an Acting Commissioner u n t i l Parliament otherwise decides. quite strong views as to the Commissioner and what hie status, ought, to be, but I shall not discuss the question on this occasion. There is much to be said, against the introduction of political influence, The emphatic promise of the and also much to be said against a Ministry, or any governing body, tryin g to shelve responsibility on to some other autocrat. Much might be said on both sides, and I shall be glad when the principal measure is introduced. I wish it to be distinctly understood that the Leader of the House has given no pledge that he will continue indefinitely the present system. quite satisfied with the reply of the Minister of Trade and Customs, but I regret that the interregnum has been so long. The reason given is that the Prime Minister is absent in England; b u t surely the Government of the country has to be carried on! We are pleased that the Prime Minister has gone to England, has had E x a c t l y ; and God such a reception, and has been able to accomplish so much good; but, at the same time, are we to assume that the rest of the -Ministry cannot, amongst them, appoint a Commissioner ? For the sake of the Service itself, there ought to be placed at its head as soon as possible the very ablest man available; and if Mr Edwards is capable of carrying on the work, he should be made Commissioner, instead of merely an acting official. I know Mr Edwards a little, and I believe him to be a capable man; indeed, I do not think that otherwise he would have been appointed as however, Mr Edwards is not the man I should choose as permanent Commissioner. It is a pity that a definite appointment has not been made, and, in my opinion, the absence of the Prime Minister is not an adequate reason why such action has been delayed. wish to know the import of this B ill , because I do not like the look of it . ber present when I spoke just now 1 the Minister of.

443,Mr Yates,"If the Treasurer thinksready promised to take out that reductotion. promised something in that direction, but I wish to go further. It is the wish of the Gommittee that we should be extremely generous to those men who are sacrificing their lives on our behalf. I cannot conceive a greater handicap than the loss of both arms. A man so maimed will need to employ others to do everything for him, even to feeding him. The loss of two hands is only slightly less from the front, on the same footing as than the loss of two arms. Soldiers injured in this way should be given a living wage for the rest of their lives. It would provision for such cases? not put a great burden on the finances. It would not be necessary to turn a printing press to meet the expenditure required, for I hope, devoutly, that very few will come back so maimed, and the Treasurer could take into consideration the question of paying them 10s. a day for the rest of their lives. One honourable member, speaking on the Estimates, said that our soldiers should be paid 10s. a day or a living wage. If we are prepared'to do that, we can do something better for those who have come back maimed in the direction I have indicated, at least we can provide them with a living wage for the rest of their lives. Otherwise, Australia will not be living up to the name it has earned. trust that the honourable member will not press his amendment. The schedule provides that a soldier who has been totally incapacitated shall receive £ 3 per fortnight. The honourable member seeks to increase the allowance to £6 per fortnight, but I feel sure that the Bill, with fits Parliament prescribes under the War the amendments to which I have already consented, will prove to be a very liberal measure without the alteration which the honourable member suggests. propose to do with regard to the suggestion put forward by the honourable member for Hunter? out any deductions. embraced by the second schedule will receive the maximum rate of the pension.

To do that would be to work an injustice on a large body of men, because, in many cases, men who have lost their right arms will not be able to fit themselves for any other occujiation. If they cannot earn a livelihood, why should they be deprived of a portion of their pension ? Then, a man who has lost a leg might be willing enough to work, but there are only certain occupations to whicli he could apply himself, generally of a clerical character. But how many of the miners, navvies, and other working men could take up such work or fit themselves for doing so, especially if they have reached the age of fort y or forty-five? A man who goes to the f r o n t runs tlie risk of losing his l if e , ' and if he loses a limb, the least the country can do is to give him the f u l l pension. If such a man can earn anything in addition to the pension, good luck to h i m ; it is our duty, as legislators, to make ample provision without any discrimination. Sometimes a man w it h one arm is quite as badly placed as a man with one arm and only one leg; it depends on circumstances. this war is going to be protracted, and there are already some thousands of men permanently maimed, with a likelihood of that number being largely increased. The Treasurer would do well f o reconsider the matter, and I am sure the people of Australia would support any Parliament prepared to make adequate provision for all who are maimed at the war. No one would contend that a man who has lost an arm or a leg is not permanently disabled so far as his f u t u re is concerned. If that be admitted, the least we can do is to make the pensions uniform so as to avoid, amongst other things, bad feeling in the ranks of the men themselves. General) [10.3] -No one who knows me would charge me with being unsympathetic with any people, especially with those who belong to the class from whicli T came. In my judgment, what honourable members are endeavouring to do tonigh t will eventually recoil on us, and in saying that I do not wish to be misunderstood. From the records that I have seen, France, in this regard, is rising to the occasion; but, seeing that she has hundreds of men for every u n it in our ranks, she could not attempt to provide, as we Y e t the schedule are doing, for those maimed at the f r o n t . The French authorities are furnishing the men with artificial limbs and other scientific aids of the latest and best design, and are educating their disabled men, in many special schools all over the country, in trades of which they previously had no knowledge whatever. The men are thus enabled, not only to earn a living, but to compete with others with their f u l l set of limbs. We have something more to do than provide our disabled men witli a perpetual pension. A man of energy and strength, who has suffered for his country, is always anxious to do work of some kind, and the W ar Committees have made arrangements to meet the cases of such men. Asi n France, artificial limbs and other aids will be provided to the utmost possible extent; and it may surprise honourable members to learn that with an artificial arm it is possible to write, thread a needle, and perform other operations in a manner simply marvellous. off at the shoulder? to use the muscles of the shoulder to move There is no doubt that the mechanical arm; what can be done in this way is almost unbelievable. I urge upon honourable members who are contending for an amendment to look to the futur e a little. To-day we are on a wave of artificial prosperity, the result of which will be to mortgage the country for many years to come. When the war is over will come the aftermath-the inevitable reaction. Employment will be scarce, and if disabled men with pensions are available for work without restriction we shall find them being engaged under the standard rate of wages.. They will enter into competition, and the unionist standard and principles will be undermined. In my opinion, the Government, in this B ill , are not only liberal, but magnanimous, though I do not say they are too liberal.

In New Zealand the Government had a majority of one, and the Opposition, with a view to defeating the -Government, proposed that the pension should be increased over the amount provided in the B ill before Parliament. The Government, of course, did not wish to go out of office, and, to safeguard their position, increased the amount themselves. That is how the pension came to be £ 1 15s. in New Zealand. was the result of the deliberations of a J o in t Committee from both sides of the House. .that the circumstances were as I state. Personally, I think that a man who is totally disabled is not as helpless as a man partially disabled.

The two classes of men cannot be put on the same basis, and I ask honourable members to consider the equity underlying the question. maimed men the same pension that we pa y to the totally disabled men, we are not dealing fairly by the latter. The Government have listened to the appeals made, and have made certain compromises, and I think this fact ought to be taken into account by honourable members who are urging a change. It is not a question of concessions granted our boys on the battlefield, and I venby the Government to the Committee, but ture to say that if the people had a voice oue of the equitable treatment of our in this matter they would decide by an soldiers who have been at tlie front , who overwhelming majority in favour of are at the front, and who are going to the granting f u l l pensions to our maimed front.

The Postmaster-General spoke of the cost of this scheme. There is not an honourable If wo give the partially member who does not think as much about its cost as he does.

A man who loses both eyes at the front must surely be much worse off than a man who loses only one eye. Consequently the Government propose to grant tlie former a pension of 30s. a week, and the latter a pension of 15s. per week. In the same way, a man who loses a hand, an arm, or a foot, will receive a pension of 22s. 6d. per week, I was hopeful that honourable members, having succeeded in beating down the Treasurer in the way that they have done, would be satisfied. I am sorry that some of them are not.

But I would point out that the B ill provides that these allowances should be made only in cases in which soldiers are totally incapacitated. Consequently I maintain that they w ill not be payable to the dependants of soldiers who have lost only a limb.

If she did so, it would probably debar her, later on, from getting a pension under the War Pensions Act. It is our duty to see that these people are well cared for. The Postmaster-General has said that they can fill certain positions, but it is for the very purpose of safeguarding against their taking other men's positions that we should keep them in decent comfort now.

There has been praise-worthy evidence of sympathy in discussing the Bill, and in accepting the increased liabilities, but there should be some measure of financial prudence. I believe, with all my heart, that when we have done all that is possible, we cannot do too much for the men who have come back maimed or absolutely incapacitated, but this Bill is not the last word. Later on, when we come to understand the liabilities for which the country is responsible, we can do something more, and I feel sure that Parliament will show the greatest possible generosity in doing so, and the people will be behind them. But let us advance prudently. We may be prepared to risk the last shilling, but we cannot go beyond it. well alone for the moment, and later on allow Parliament to go further if the case demands it. one leg cracking stones at 3s. a day! are one-legged men in this country who have been as successful as men without any such physical handicap. Surgical appliances have been so improved that a man with one leg can be fixed up to he almost as sound as any other man. I ask honourable members not to be unfair to the Government. I have the deepest sympathy for the Treasurer. I compliment him. I know that he would give the utmost, but I think it unfair to put on him, and on the Government, a strain of such a character that we cannot possibly estimate it at this moment. Later on, when we may be in a position to approximately estimate our liabilities, we can extend our generosity. [10.39] I have yet to learn that Australia is so terribly poor that the people cannot afford to pay the money required in connection with a pensions scheme. If we go down the streets of our cities at night we see hundreds of motor cars waiting for people who have been enjoying themselves. YetI am told that Australia cannot afford to pay decent pensions to the men who are out endeavouring to save the Empire. Some men are prepared to give the last man in -this fight, but they are not prepared to give the last shilling. We have had our Postmaster-General making an impassioned speech, begging honourable members not to ask for this concession for the men who come back maimed and witli nervous systems shattered. Who can tell the condition of these men who have been under fire ? They deserve our utmost consideration. Yet we find honourable members saying that Australia is not in a position to pay them a pension of £1 a week for any length of time. I am informed that it was on the suggestion of tlie honourable member for Parramatta that we provided that widows who marry again should receive the pension for two years after tlieir second marriage; yet the unfortunate man who comes back deprived of his limb is to look for work, and compete in the world with strong people who have remained at It is better to leave home. Of course, we shall send the last man and spend the last shilling, but until the Treasurer can show that Australia is on the verge of bankruptcy I trust that we shall hear no more of such speeches as that I was surprised to hear from the Postmaster-General-h e who claimed to be the only Labour man who had been so long in the party, who claimed lo be a philanthropist, who in Opposition, and even when sitting behind the Government, told us of the great generosity he would show if he ever got to tbe front bench.
