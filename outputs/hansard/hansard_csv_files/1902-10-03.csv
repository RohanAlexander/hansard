2,Mr Tudor,"Can the Minister forin the public service who are receiving less than £ 1 1 0 per annum, ordered on the 7 th February, will be ready ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I thought that it had been laid upon the table, but I shall make inquiries, and get it as soon as possible. Applications for the information have been sent to the various branches of the service, but the preparation of returns of this kind takes time. Minister that, two days after the return in reference to section 25 of the Public Service Act, about which tlie honourable member for Yarra has asked, was ordered, the Prime Minister promised me that he would also have a return prepared showing what public servants will be affected by section 21.' W ill the Minister see that this matter is attended to? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I shall be very glad to give instructions in regard to the matter. I would point out, however, that these returns will be very voluminous, because the service is a large one, and therefore'they cannot be prepared very quickly. BILL. Trade and Customs expect that the Committee upon the Bonuses for Manufactures Bill will be able to report this session ? If not, what action does he propose to take in regard to the measure during the recess ? of possibility that the committee's inquiry can be completed this session. I think that a progress report will be presented, and that steps will be taken to enable the members of the committee to continue as a Royal commission the inquiries which the legislature has determined upon. for Defence intend to take Colonel Stuart's case into consideration at'once ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I promised last night to inquire into it, and I shall do so, but I have not had much time to deal with the matter yet. I cannot promise to rush into the consideration of matters of this kind. New Customs regulations. 46 0 z Defence, upon notice1.

Where an officer's present salary (consolidated) is above the maximum of his rank, his salary (consolidated) will be reduced to-the.maximum.

13,Mr Watson,"Ho w much is the buildingpiece of land that it may be better for us to hand it back to the State Government and go elsewhere. The barracks occupy one of the choicest building sites in Sydney, and we do not need such a valuable piece of land for military purposes. It is desirable that this question should be settled before the site of the new drill-hall is decided upon. The drill-hall at Kyneton, which is to cost £1,200, was provided for on last year's Estimates, and it is desired to re-vote the amount. tioned in the Estimates that the drill-hall for the metropolitan volunteers at Sydney is to be erected at the Victoria Barracks, and that the £3,000 will be a first instalment of the cost. Therefore, if the information now supplied is correct the Estimates must have been framed under a misapprehension, because it is assumed that the Victoria Barracks site will be adopted. If the barracks were sold the buildings would go for nothing. Sir WILLIAM LYNE have to pay for the buildings which are there. Some of the States seem to be under an erroneous impression with reference to the properties which have been handed Over to the Commonwealth. We have to pay for the buildings, but if we hand them back we shall get rid of tbe liability attached to them. shall pay cash 1 Sir AVILLIAMLYNE States wish that a definite method of payment should be adopted, and nothing will be done until an agreement is arrived at between the States and the Government. I understand that there is no building at tbe Victoria Barracks suitable for the metropolitan volunteers. The new premises will comprise an orderly room, stores, ifcc. wish to direct the attention of the Minister to item 3 of subdivision 1. The honourable gentleman has told us that this amount is intended to recoup regiments which have erected these buildings out of the capitation grants or other allowances which have been paid in the past. If that be so, I desire to j know whether he is prepared to similarly recoup all the regiments which have acted in a similar way 1 In Victoria there are two volunteer regiments which make it a ' point of honour to avoid touching any portion of the capitation allowance. The whole amount goes into the companies' funds, and is expended for regimental purposes. If the 1st and 2nd Regiments i u New South Wales are to be given a recoup, I think that all the other regiments are entitled to the same treatment. « Seeing that the Acting Minister for Defence entertains such very grave objections to paying the South Australian Government a commission of 10 per cent, for supervising the Commonwealth public works undertaken in that State, I wish him to explain the item of £1,813 for "" supervision of works by State officers,"" which appears upon page 39 of the Estimates. I desire to know whether that amount covers supply of plant, railway fares, and the drawing up of plans and specifications 1 If it does not, it is very much in excess of the sum which the Minister refuses to pay to South Australia. total expenditure in connection with the No : we should division which is now under consideration amounts to £29,221. That sum is in addition to the £762,000 which is set down as tbe total cost of the Defence department. But I would point out that upon page 39, there is an item of £25,805 for ""Works and Buildings."" Are the committee to understand that in addition to the £762,000, which is set down as the total cost of the department we are to spend £29,221 for ""Additions, New Works and Buildings,"" and a further sum of £25,805 for "" Works No. The and Buildings."" £25,000 which appears in the Estimates of the department for Home Affairs is intended to provide for repairs, fittings, and maintenance of buildings for defence purposes, and for the payment of rents, whereas the £29,000 is to cover the cost of entirely new works. The first amount is for the maintenance of existing works, and to provide funds for the payment of' rents in various places, particulars of which are given in the Estimates for the department of Home Affairs commencing on page 22. In New South Wales the outlay involved in repairs and maintenance aggregates £9,000, whilst the payment of rents represents an additional £2,095. Under these headings there is thus a total expenditure in that State of £11,095. In Victoria the total expenditure is £6,680 ; in Queensland £3,300 ;",17,Suppl Y 1902 3

I asked if the charge was purely for supervision, or whether the supplying of plant would add to the cost. The Minister demurred to the amount which was asked by the South Australian Government, and yet he proposes a very large sum apparently for supervision only. Sir WILLIAM LYNE had answered the question of the honourable member. This money is voted in order to pay the cost of supervision under an arrangement yet to be made. If a charge for plant is made by the Stat.es Government, it must bea charge against works ; and that is what I stated to the South Australian Government. For the cost of supervision a percentage should be fixed irrespective of other charges; and the item to which the honourable member has called attention amounts to only 3 per cent, or 4 per cent. As I said before, I do not think that any money has been paid up to the present, no definite arrangement having yet been made. That is why I was so particular not to allow a charge of 10 per cent, to be fixed in the case of South Australia. I saw that that would have set a precedent which it would be difficult to avoid in the other States. I shall deal with the remainder of the States exactly in the same wav as with South Australia. been told that there is a reduction of £175,000 in the Defence Estimates. Sir works and buildings the saving woulcl have been £188.000, and not £175,000. note to the Defence Estimates we find that the total cost of the Department, exclusive of compensation, is £762,000, and that the total reduction made is £175,000. Sir and buildings are not included. the figures, however, we find that the total two regiments applied for authority to use Estimates last year were £853,000, nd that the clothing capitation grant for the purthis year they are £791,000, plus for works and buildings, thus showing a subsequently found that money belonging total of £820,000. From this it will be seen that the Estimates are not reduced by £175,000, but by only £33,000. learned member is wrong. in the foot-note, it is perfectl)' plain that the total I have arrived at will have to be drawn from the Treasury in the ensuing year. I see that £1,500 is provided for a drill-hall at Kyneton. Is the weather so dreadfully inclement at Kyneton that a drill-hall is necessary for the protection of the members of the force ? MrL . E.

This vote is intended as a recoup, and the money will be distributed amongst the regiments which should have received it originally. I have heard no suggestion of any similar claims from other regiments, but if there arose a legitimate, case, such as this evidently is, where the members of the regiments, had in their enthusiasm erected a drill hall, I should suggest that it be treated in the same way. I cannot, however, give any absolute promise. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I think this sets a very bad example.

Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I was strongly inclined to oppose this item, on the principle that a regiment which receives a capitation grant has no right to any kind of refund. I know that some regiments in Victoria cannot get even the most ordinary repairs done which are necessary for the proper drilling of the men. There are big holes in the asphalt of the drill halls, and while that state of affairs has to continue, we have here a proposal for the recoup of a large sum of money. Some explanation is due to the committee. I shall be sorry to oppose the item if the circumstances be such as the Treasurer has stated, and further explanation may assure us that this is an isolated case which presents no danger of a precedent. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I have just received a memorandum to the effect that there is no similar case known. There are instances where regiments have erected drill halls with money raised by public subscriptions. lic subscriptions are not recouped 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE No ; I am merely mentioning the fact that drill-halls are erected under such circumstances. money in this case ?

A great deal of enthusiasm was shown about the erection of this hall, and I suppose the Minister for Defence did not want to damp the ardour of the men.

Before the honourable member speaks, I wish to refer to the question of fortifications and defence. Western Australia needs as much, if not more, attention in that respect than any other portion of the Commonwealth. port, as it is the first place of call in Australia for mail steamers, but it is in no way defended. If fortifications are needed in other portions of the Commonwealth, surely in Western Australia, which might be made the base for an attack on the rest of the Commonwealth, ought to receive some attention in that regard? examination is made of the figures in the Estimates it is found that the expenditure is considerably less there than in any otherportion of the Commonwealth. Although the Minister for Defence is a representative of that State, still I think that he might see his way, or might be supported by the Ministry, in any desire he might have to spend more money in the State or, at any rate, a fair proportion of the vote for the purpose. I am not in favour of a large expenditure on defence, but I hold that Western Australia is entitled to a reasonable proportion of the vote. On the gold-fields there is a very large adult male population. Eor a long time these men have been desirous of establishing volunteer corps-and volunteer corps are established on the gold-fields but the amount of support they have received has been very insignificant. They have no drill hall, and I am not sure whether they haA'e rifle ranges yet. It is. for that reason that I Avish to know Avhere this item on the Estimates is to be spent, and .also if the Government have taken into their consideration the need for the defence of Fremantle. intended to raise the question of the defence that the figures are correct-a t £845,445, of Fremantle.

It is being A'oted for the purpose of fortifications, barracks, rifle ranges, and drill-halls. It would take a great deal more than that sum to erect a decent building for a drill-hall. Fremantle is quite unprotected, and no A total sum of £1,450 doubt it would be one of tbe first points for Avhich an enemy Avould make. I hope that the Minister Avill consider this question and place on the Estimates, the sum Avhich Fremantle deserves for its protection. that the explanationof the Acting Ministeri n Fremantle is a very important regard to the drill-room in NeAV South Wales is altogether satisfactory. When the last Estimates Avere under consideration Ave had an instance of Avhat the Minister for Defence did in Western Australia. "" Why,"" he said, ""you parsimonious lot, I spent £600,000 Avithout the sanction of Parliament,"" and now the Acting Minister is left to get him When an out of the trouble into Avhich he has run the corps. If the committee pass the item for a recoup it will establish a precedent. Perhaps there are many other corps Avhich have done the same thing. . .

Otherwise I should have no control over works and buildings. I must impress upon honourable members that it is impossible to say that in the future we sball bring the whole of the expenditure for the Defence department, including construction and repairs, within £700,000. A question has been asked with regard to the defence at Fremantle, and similar questions might be put as to other places. If we were to say that £700,000 was to cover the whole of the expenditure, it would be of no use thinking of erecting defence works at Fremantle or elsewhere. The spirit of the discussion last night was not to the effect that the whole of the defence works were to be included in that sum. What was meant was the general administration of the department, not works which sometimes might cost £100,000, sometimes £300,000 or £400,000, and sometimes £50,000, according to circumstances. whether the sum of £1,000, which is set to have details concerning the £9,000 for down for rifle ranges in Western is not a re-vote 1 was passed last year, but very late, so that we could not expend the money. casion the item is not to be merely a book entry, because last year, in Western Australia, strong complaints were made about Killarney, Longreach, and Woollongabba, and the inadequacy of the targets throughout at other places as may be required from time to the whole of the State.

98,Sir George Turner,"In my Budgetstatement upon the assumption that the particular works with which we are now about to deal would be paid for out of loan money. The committee having determined that we should not raise a loan, it became necessary to recast our proposals so as to make the expenditure, moreespecially in those States which occupy the least favorable position, as low as -we could reasonably do. The figures I have quoted show how much the different States would receive if we adhered to our former proposals. But we have struck off the revenue Estimates £32,000 in respect of works which we do not propose now to carry out. Eor example, we have struck off the £5,000 provided for a telephone switchboard in South Australia. That means that the difference in regard to the surplus payable to South Australia will really be £20,000. These amounts are taken after making allowance for the sums already charged to the States and paid out of the Treasurer's advance account. struck ofF the provision for undergrounding the telephone wires in Victoria1 struck off the whole scheme. It would be useless to do the work piecemeal. It is better that it should be left until brighter times come. like to make a few observations in regard to these additional estimates of expenditure. I take it that they have been circulated as the result of the division which took place a few days ago when the committee refused to consent to a loan being raised for public works. These works, which should be provided for out of loan moneys, and which should be treated as new expenditure, must now be provided for, if undertaken at all, out of revenue. So far as Queensland is concerned I am afraid that with the reduced revenue it will be found a matter of impossibility to carry out these works, and I am sorry to say that what applies to Queensland applies more or less to several other States. expended in Queensland is onlysome 26,000. New South Wales and Victoria have too The balance has already been expended largely influenced their policy. and charged. We have cut down the expenditure in Queensland as much as ism. possible. provided for new works and buildings in Parliament as being members of a federal Queensland'at a cost of £54,795. That sum is to be taken out of revenue, but if a Loan Bill had been passed the works would have been provided for out of loan moneys. I think that the committee made a mistake in refusing permission to the Government to raise a loan. As honourable members are aware, the necessity for a loan at this time is due to the general depression which exists throughout the Commonwealth. I have no doubt that if the depression passes away, as I hope it soon will do, many necessary works in connection with the extension of the telegraphic and telephonic system will be carried out for the most part out of revenue; but I think it is impossible at the present time to provide for them in that way. only those which are absolutely necessiirv. be the case. The Treasurer estimates that as compared with the revenue for 1900, Queensland's net revenue from customs and Have the Government excise this year will show a decrease of £361,486. Taking for granted the Treasurer's assertion that the transferred departWe have ments will not cost more now than they did in 1900, we have to add to that sum the cost of federation, and I estimate Queensland's share at £38,348. These two sums added together mean that the Treasurer of Queensland will be £400,000 worse off than he was before federation. quence of federation. had something to do with it . the whole of the blame to federation.

111,Mr R. Edwards,"I have always enfamily, but we have not all regarded our position in the same way. There has been too much provincialism. I trust, however, that we shall overcome that failing, and that each State in the Commonwealth will be considered equally one with the other. The Treasurer puts down £54,795 as Queensland's share of expenditure on works which he had intended to execute out of loan money. That sum will also have to come out of Queensland's income, so that the Treasurer of that State, instead of receiving £45,000 less than last year, will receive £95,000 less. Another point is that Queensland will thus receive £45,000 less than the actual three-fourths of her net customs and excise revenue-a n experience which no other State anticipates. If these works were treated as new expenditure, as they should be treated, Queensland would be called upon to pay this year only about £30,000 instead of £54,000. This and other matters have given rise to the great dissatisfaction at present existing in Queensland and elsewhere with regard to federation. I am very sorry to say that under existing circumstances it would be nothing less than actual cruelty for the federal Treasurer to appropriate from the Queensland revenue the amount of money proposed for this year. I do not desire to place any obstacle in the way of carrying out any necessary public works, but I do not see how it is possible, under the present have to add to the amount of £674,000 the circumstances, for the Queensland finances to bear additional expenditure to the extent of £50,000 or £60,000 a year. the Treasurer to give the committee some revised estimate of the amount of surplus revenue to be returned to the States, in view of the reductions in expenditure which have been proposed since the original estimate was given. The Government propose to expend out of revenue £220,969. expended a certain amount of money out of the Treasurer's advance. We propose to -expend altogether £257,000. the surplus revenue to be returned to the States amounted to £915,000, but certain savings have been arranged for, an amount of £35,000 in connection with the military Estimates, and certain reduction in connection with the Works Estimates, the result of which will be to increase the surplus to be returned. there will be from £80,000 to £100,000 unexpended. of £915,000 must be added the amounts to which I have just referred, and I should like to know what will be the balance left to be returned to the States after the amount proposed to be expended upon public works is deducted. Asi t appears to me, the Treasurer's proposal to spend £220,969 less on works than his Original proposal will leave an estimated balance to be returned to the States of £674,031 . I arrive at that by deducting £220,969 from the original estimated balance of £915,000. To this we have now to add the £80,000 to £100,000 which will not be spent, leaving an estimated balance to be returned to the States of from £754,000 to £774,000. amount of the surplus returnable to each State, and the amount of the reduced surplus. I have given honourable members those figures. The total surplus to be returned will be £915,000, the amount previously stated, less the £220,969 proposed to be expended on works. That will be about £670,000. but we are proposing to make large sa rings. savings that will be made by the nonexpenditure of certain votes, and I think we may put the total reductions we propose to make at from £80,000 to £100,000. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) One cannot help sympathizing with the honourable member for Oxley upon the depressed condition of the great State of Queensland. But some of the statements which the honourable member made, if telegraphed to Queensland without explanation, are likely to create a false impression. The honourable member referred to a falling off in the Queensland customs revenue to the extent of £200,000 or £300,000. It is hardly necessary to point out that that is one of the inevitable results of the adoption of a uniform Tariff, and that as that money will not have to be paid by the people of Queensland in the shape of customs revenue, it will still remain in their pockets, and may be attached by other means of taxation. pay the duty ?",27,George Turner Th E New Works Impossible For Me To Give Any Promise See

Has that not been a result of federation? I have given the key to the observations of the honourable member for Oxley with respect to the reduction of Queensland revenue . resulting from federal legislation. The honourable member has really pointed to the difference between the Customs Tariff of Queensland and the Customs Tariff of the Commonwealth as showing how the revenue of Queensland has been prejudiced. far as I can understand the position of South Australia, we had a total revenue from customs and excise last year of £687,182, and the total revenue which the Treasurer expects for that-State this year is £680,000. We have already included in the Estimates of expenditure and ' revenue a sum of £20,105, for post-office buildings, . and so on, and on the Supplementary Estimates it is proposed to spend another £20,000, that is deducting the £5,000 for the switchboard, making a total expenditure of £40,105.. It is very evident that the State treasurer of South Australia will have some trouble to balance his accounts, and that was the reason for my anxiety when I so strenuously opposed the construction of works from revenue at this particular stage. Under all the circumstances it* seems to me that it would be fair to leave it to the State Governments to say whether they desire that these works shall be pushed on at the present stage, when they know that if they are pushed on the Cost will be deducted from the State revenue. liament is charged with the duty of carrying out some of these works-thos e connected with the post-office, for example.

Why should we not ask the States Governments to suspend some of the works they have proposed ? We have the money for these works. and that is an unfortunate position for the States. It is very unfair that this House should take upon itself to insist upon the construction of certain works when the additional expenditure involved will only create further confusion in the State finances. member advocate the suspension of all necessary-works in connection with the Postal department ? suspension of necessary works. I know that some of these works will be revenue producing. Under existing circumstances the time seems to me inopportune to insist upon the 'payment for all works out of 1, revenue. However, as the matter has been decided by the committee, I do not want to re-open the question; but I hope that the Commonwealth, in carrying out new works, will consider the financial position of the various States, and, where possible, let the expenditure stand over until next year, by which time, perhaps, a good season will have put things in a better position.

Some dissatisfaction is felt by myself and others in regard to the division taken last week ' on the proposal to reduce the salary of the Secretary to the Attorney-General, because some honourable members appeared voting under a misapprehension regarding the real question before the committee. As to my remarks at tlie time, concerning the action of the Chairman of Committees in voting with the Government, I am convinced, from what that honourable gentleman has told me since, that he did so inadvertently, and not with deliberate intention, and therefore I withdraw my imputation of unfairness. I shall not detain honourable members by dealing with this matter at length, because we all know what the question at stake really is. The attitude I take is that the Government are asking Parliament to add as a permanent increase to the salary of the Secretary to the Attorney-General the sum of £ 5 0 , because an allowance of that amount was voted for him last year, as a reward for the extra duties imposed upon him by the length of the session. The sum in question is not a large one, but I object to the increase on principle. ra ,l) -The honourable member for Bland is under a misapprehension. After the services of the gentleman referred to were first secured by the Commonwealth, he was, and remained for a long time, the only officer in the Attorney-General's department, his duties being those of Parliamentary Draftsman, Crown solicitor, and Secretary to the Attorney-General. He was appointed for the performance of those duties at a salary of £ 8 0 0 a year. When the first set of Estimates was prepared, as he was acting as permanent head of the department, and the salary fixed for oflicers in that 'position, except where a larger remuneration had been previously enjoyed in .State employ, -was £750, the £ 8 0 0 per annum at which he was appointed was divided into two amounts-£75 0 as salary as head of the Attorney-General's department and £ 5 0 for additional professional 46 p 2 services. The arrangement was made to secure uniformity, and does not fairly represent the claim in his case. This gentleman is the chief professional officer of the Commonwealth, upon whom, especially in the early years of federation, ;,an exceptional burden has fallen, and a salary of £ 8 0 0 per annum is a very moderate remuneration for his services, especially if measured by the salaries paid in the States to Crown Solicitors and to heads of departments. the States are all men of more experience. man is not merely Crown Solicitor; he is also Parliamentary Draftsman and Secretary to the Attorney-General. He and the Chief Clerk have constituted for two years the entire permanent staff of the Attorney-General's department. The£ 5 0 by which tbe honourable member for Bland wishes to reduce the salary was not an extra allowance last year, nor is it an increase this year. It is part of the salary at which the officer in question was originally app pointed. I trust that honourable members will not single out for reduction the salary of an officer of great responsibility and great merit. the honourable member for Bland for the withdrawal of his remarks against me last week. I voted on the occasion referred to through pure inadvertence. You, Mr Speaker, had left for Adelaide, and I asked the honourable member for Kennedy to take the chair in committee so that he might report to me as Deputy Speaker. When the division bells rang, it was perilously near the time at which my. own train was to start, and I therefore remained in the chamber, and inconsiderately voted. HadI given auy thought to the matter, I should either have resumed the chair in committee, and allowed the honourable member for Kennedy to record his vote, or, as Deputy Speaker, have followed your example, sir, by remaining outside the chamber. will be convenient to regard the determination upon the amendment which the honourable member for Bland has moved as a test vote upon the question of the proposed reduction. Honourable members who do not wish to reduce the salary can vote against the recommittal.",30,George Turner I Liave Reduced Turner

I do not notice any proposal for the erection or equipment of a proper hospital, and I should like to know if some provision cannot be made. ""When I spoke last night with reference to the examinations which officers have to pass before they can obtain commissions in the Royal Australian Artillery, the honourable member for Melbourne, who is one of the board of examiners, said that I was incorrect in stating that Latin, German, Trench, algebra, euclid, trigonometry, and other subjects were among those in which candidates had to be examined. I find, by reference to the Government Gazette of 9th May last, that examination in these subjects is essential, aud that, therefore, my contention was correct. It is peculiar that a member of the board which has to judge as to the qualifications of candidates should not know the subjects for examination. a large number of members take the view that the £700,000 expended on the up-keep of the defence forces should include provision for the ammunition which is used in ordinary rifle and gun practice, and so on. A proposal for the purchase of new rifles, or of guns for arming forts, or for the establishment of an ammunition factory, would have to be dealt with on its merits and spesially provided for. our defence forces to cost us £S45,000 this year, whereas last year the expenditure was £853,000.

The Bill which I have the honour to bring under the notice of the House, is intended, as its title indicates, to make temporary provision for enforcing claimsagainst the Commonwealth. If it were designed to be a permanent measure, it would have been presented in another form. Honourable members will realize that it is submitted at the present time because there has been obviously no opportunity for the passage of the Judiciary Bill or of the High Court Procedure Bill during the current session. The immediate cause of its introduction is a judgment given by the Supreme Court of New South Walesi n a case in which my honourable colleague, Mr Drake, consented to be defendant. In that case, the Judge held that his submission to the State jurisdiction was given by him as Postmaster General; that he could not accept that individual submission, and that consequently the plaintiff could obtain no redress in that court. This Bill is not intended to anticipate more than is absolutely necessary the passage of the measures to which I have alluded, which make permanent provision for enforcing claims against the Commonwealth as well as for all other classes of cases, and for the creation of a High Court whose jurisdiction shall embrace these and other causes of action.

The necessity during the current session for subordinating every other interest to the passing of the Tariff has compelled us most reluctantly to postpone the consideration of the measures to which I have referred, and we now find ourselves, just prior to the recess, called upon to take the requisite steps to provide that during the interval which must elapse before those Bills are placed upon the statute-book there shall be no injury for which the Commonwealth that will not be subject to jurisdiction even in our States courts. Honourable members are aware of the ancient doctrine originally placed the Crown, in every dependency in which it was represented, beyond the reach of the ordinary courts of law. A very special procedure was necessary, and in every instance, both in the mother consent of the Crown was essential before it could be made the defendant in any action. Gradually, however, it has become the practice to provide by statute for the submission of the Crown to the courts of the realm, and that, in a varying degree, has been the aim in the several States of this Union. amplest authority is delegated to the courts to deal with cases against' the Crown. others that power is of a more limited character. But it must be recognised tjiat the trend of modern legislation is to render it perfectly possible for the subject to bring even the Crown before the courts in regard to any matter upon which he may feel aggrieved. by a succession of stages to which it is unnecessary to refer. But I wish specially to call the attention of honourable members to the fact that, temporary as this measure is, it marks one very serious departure. Mr Deakin. the mother country, and in the various colonies, the Crown has consented by statute to become liable, more or less, to the jurisIt is merely intended-as diction of the courts, but in every single make temporary proinstance that liability has been limited to the courts directly associated with the further Crown. That is to say, in Great Britain the Sovereign the Crown consents to submit to the jurisdiction of its own courts. In the same manner, in each of the States of Australia, the Crown consents to submit to the courts of that State. In no instance does the Crown in any one of its dominions accept the jurisdiction of the courts of any other of its"" dominions except by way of final appeal to the Privy Council from its oversea dependencies. The proposals contained in this Bill, however, mark an entirely different step, and one of a very much more serious character. In this measure the Commonwealth proposes not to submit to the jurisdiction of its own.courts-as will be proposed in the subsequent legislation to which I have referred-bu t to the courts of the States. That marks a very grave and distinctly new departure. It is because is responsible of the gravity and novelty of that departure that it appears to the Government desirable that we should take whatever steps are rewhich quired to meet the present emergency in such a manner as to indicate tlie comparative strangeness of this proposal, and also to preserve the dignity of the Commonwealth. Honourable members will observe that in this measure those who desire to country and its colonies, the make any claim against the Commonwealth pray the Governor General to appoint a defendant, and that the Governor General is left perfectly free to exercise his option-o n the advice, of course, of his responsible Ministers-in each and every regard. Of course it would be idle, to bring forward a proposition of that In some of them the very character if it were not the intention of the Government to give effect to it . I In call attention to this provision because by it we do not seek merely to keep the word of promise to the ear, but because it is our intention, in the exercise of this option, to submit the Commonwealth to the federal jurisdiction of State Courtsi n the case of all This concession was made claims of which we have' now any knowledge, or which are likely to arise. That submission is made optional in order to maintain the dignity of the Commonwealth-to act as a perpetual reminder In on the face of the measure that the. Commonwealth is submitting itself to courts which are not its own, and that those who take advantage of the provisions do so by its grace. When our permanent measures come before the Chamber, it will be found that provision is made for rendering this a matter of right, and not of grace, in the courts of the Commonwealth. established, and as this is a temporary measure, this provision has been inserted, not with the object of defeating the intention of the Bill-no t with the object of enabling the Governor General, after having been authorized under this Act to appoint a defendant, to evade his responsibilitybut merely to mark the fact that it is by a concession that the Commonwealth'submits to the federal jurisdiction of State courts which is here vested in them. The temporary character of the measure is prominent in clause 7, which is as follows:In any action or suit brought under tliis Act, any appeal, or application for leave to appeal, from a decision of the Supreme Court of a State, which in the opinion of the Attorney-General involves a constitutional question, or a question of importance to the Commonwealth, shall on the application of the Attorney-General be postponed until a time not later than the date of expiration of this Act. There is no attempt here to take away any right of appeal. It is plain on the face of the clause that the object is to enable a case, although it may arise upon some simple or even trifling incident, and be of small importance from a financial point of view, if its decision broaches a constitutional or other question of magnitude, to be postponed until the High Court shall have been established. The .Federal High Court will be able to deal with such matters, and will have an opportunity of exercising the further powers which it ' possesses under the Constitution of deciding whether a particular constitutional issue, if it be one which affects the respective rights of the States and the Commonwealth, shall receive its final decision in Australia, or if, like every other question save the exceptions contained in section 74, shall be allowed to go to the Privy Council. The object of the clause is simply to enable the appeal in cases involving questions of such magnitude to be suspended until time has been allowed this Parliament to create the High Court and provide for its procedure. This will permit questions of federal interest, involving the interpretation of the Constitution or of federal law the determination of federal rights and powers of the greatest moment-to be considered by the Federal High Court before they are remitted, if they are to be remitted, to the Privy Council as the final court of appeal. I do not pro pose to enter further into the clauses of this But, as those courts are not B i ll or the particular mode of drafting which has been adopted. I hope I have conveyed to honourable members' minds the fact that this is a temporary measure which, by the fashion in which the clauses are drawn, emphasizes the fact that it is intended to operate only until the establishment of a Federal High Court has been obtained. Some of these proposals were submitted in the Judiciary Bill, and the remainder were to be submitted in the High Court Procedure Bill. The temporary nature of the measure I use as the ground of a request to the honerable and learnedmember for South Australia, Mr Glynn, not to raise the vast issues involved in the amendments of which he has given notice. I shall submit at the proper time that those amendments cannot be entertained in connection with this particular measure; but, in any event, urge the honourable and learned member not to press his amendments on the consideration of Parliament in this session. To deal with them would need, not only far more time than we can spare to-day, but' farmore time than Parliament can spare this session. They involve some of the most fundamental issues of the main Judiciary B ill and the High Court Procedure Bill, which the Government intend to submit next session. The amendments, undoubtedly, show the devotion of the honourable and learned member to those ideas, which, with him, are not of to-day or yesterday; he has been perfectly consistent ever since he advocated similar proposals in the Convention which preceded the passing of the Federal Constitution. But while I admit the honourable and learned member's consistency in again, at the first opportunity, bringing these matters under the attention of the House-and , indeed, he has previously directed the attenof honourable members to themI would urge him not to complicate and overload the issues which we are called upon to consider. We are all wearied by the prolonged session, and in no mood to entertain the very vital changes which he suggests. When we come to deal with the clauses in committee, I shall be prepared to show reasons why the particular form of the measure has bden selected. Honourable members will see by the side-notes that all the clauses are more or less based on provisions already in force in the several States. ral, know of any State law which gives the right to press an action in tort? think, in all the States except Victoria and South Australia. But, to leave points of detail, I commend this measure to the House as a means by which it will be possible for those who. are aggrieved by any failure of the Commonwealth to perform its obligations, or by any wrongful act on the part of the Commonwealth, to submit their causes to the federal jurisdiction of State courts. That has been done in the simplest manner, because we shall be called on nextsession to legislate in what I hope will be a final and practical manner fov these and all similar judicial needs. and the observations of the Attorney General offer a very attractive field of criticism, but I feel that, at this time, under the great pressure of public business, we must really restrict discussion as much as possible I believe there is a general desire that a Bill of the kind shall be passed, and, therefore, the second reading need not form the subject of a long debate. I am prepared to waive my right of making a speech on the second reading, so as to get as soon as possible to the practical issues involved in the clauses. I want to say a few words on this measure, and may as well do so now as at a later stage. The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, has given notice of certain amendments, in tbe substance of which I concur. The effect of these amendments is simply to make the Bill less cumbrous, and to allow the Commonwealth or a State to be sued directly, in place of adding to the costs of litigation, by insisting that there shall be a petition asking the Government to allow certain persons to be put forward as nominal defendants. The provision for a petition is absolutely useless, and I think that the amendments, if they are proceeded with, will commend themselves to honourable members. But I desire to deal with a matter which is raised by clauses 7 and 8, which provide that au appeal of a State from the Supreme Court shall be delayed. on the application of the Attorney-General."" General makes application. the parties to the litigation has the right to stop or delay an appeal. I know, of course, that the object'is that an appeal may wait until the High Court be established, but in turning the proposal over in my mind, I have come to the conclusion that the clause is not only improper, but invalid. There is no right on the part of the .Federal Government to delay or obstruct the operation of an Order in Council under an Imperial Act, nor to hinder the operation of a State Act. We have no power, as a Federal Parliament, to say that a certain State Act shall not operate or shall be delayed. If we consider how it is that there is at present an appeal to the Privy Council, we may refer to an Order of Council dated 9th June, 1860. learned member not consider that tbe question is affected by the fact that these are appeals from causes heard under authority conferred by this Bill1 over the Order in Council, and, in my opinion, its effect is absolutely clear. It does not matter from what source the Supreme Court gets authority to decide a question. There is under the Orderi n Council a right in the litigant to appeal, within the time limited, to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The Order in Council is as follows :Whereas 03' an Act passed iu a session of Parliament holden in the seventh and eighth years of Her Majestyi t was enacted that it should be competent to Her Majesty, bynivyOrder or Orders in Council, to provide for the admission of appeals to Her Majesty in Council from auy judgments, sentences, decrees, or orders of any courb of justice within any Bribish colony or possession abroiid, albhougli such court should not be a court of errors or appeal within such colony or possession, and to make provision for the instituting and prosecuting such appeals, and for carrying inbo effecb auy such decisions or senbences as Her Majesty in Council should pronounce thereon. There is a right given to any person who feels aggrieved from an order of the Supreme Court, if the amount exceeds in value £500, to appeal to Her Majesty, her heirs and successors. So far, I think, it is perfectly clear the Imperial Act confers on the litigant a right to appeal from the",33,Commonwealth Bill Second Reading

171,Mr Mccay,Does the honourable and,36,Commonwealth Bill Second Reading
172,Mr Higgins,"I have carefully thoughtjudgment of any body which is given jurisdiction. And then, if one takes the Victorian Act-and I believe that each State has a similar law-sectio n 231 saysIf any person feel aggrieved by any decision of the court in any civil proceeding of any kind depending in the court in which the mutter in issue amounts to £1,000 sterling in value, by which the merits of the case may be concluded, it shall be lawful for such person, within 30 days after such decision may have been pronounced, to apply to tlie court for leave to appeal therefrom to He;Majesty in her Privy Council. Here, again, are two rights of appeal to the Privy Council, which are given, one by the Victorian Act, and another by the Imperial Act and Order in Council"" thereunder. Buti t is proposed by this Bil l to say that, although that right of appeal is so given, it shall not be exercised if the Attorney General see fit to move the court. I know his extreme dislike to allowing these appeals to go to the Privy Council, and at the Convention I did my best with him to have it provided that all our appeals should go to the High Court, but we lost by three votes. It is a most interesting fact that, owing to a mistake in the drafting of the Constitution, to which I shall point presently, an optional right of appeal to the Privy Council was left, and the result is disastrous. Even when the High Court is established it will be optional with a litigant who is beaten to appeal either to the Privy Council or to the High Court. That was a mistake which is easily traceable. A t page 2455 of the Melbourne Convention DebatesI find that the question was raised by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, of whether there would be an optional appeal to the Privy Council. He, as well as I , was against the option of appeal; but the chairman of the Judicial Committee, Mr now Sir Josiah Symon, who of course A'ery properly had great weight, assured the Convention deliberately that there was not the least danger; that there would be no such option. I shall quote an extract from the report of the debate, as follows :to which the Honourable Mr Glynn has directed attention will not in practice arise at all. The intention certainly was not to multiply appeals or to give an alternative option to at) appellant in a State court to appeal either direct to the Privy Council or to the High Court -We have dealt simply with appeals fi-om the High Court to the Privy Council. Under clause 73 a general jurisdiction in regard to appeals is given to the High Court. The natural anxiety of the honourable member is that there should be a power in the Parliament to put an end to appeals direct from the Supreme Court of a State to the Privy Council without going, of course, through the High Court. It appears to me that under clause 73 the appeal direct to the Privy Council is practically abolished. MrL . E. GROOM -Was the clause worded then as it is now ? could see how clause 73 had much to do with the question. In the Constitution we have firmly embedded an option for a litigant to choose whether he will so to the Privy Council or to the High Court, if there is such a body. I am sorry for it ; I think it is a mistake. and learned member think that that question is involved in the Billt attempt to prevent an appeal being brought to the Privy Council within a certain time. One of the essential points in Magna Charta was thattheKing would not only not deny to any one justice and right, but would delay to no man justice and right. Supposing that next month a judgment should be given by the Supreme Court in Sydney on such a question as arose the other day when a man was injured \>y some electric wires. As the law now stands he could appeal to the Privy Council right oft' upon paying a certain deposit. Under clause 7 of the Bill that right is stayed and stopped. The opposing party the Attorney-General-ma} simply move the court, aud say, r "" I am-entitled to have this appeal stopped."" Unless a man can prosecute his appeal within a certain time it is lost, and there is no provision here for any suspension of the operation of the New South WalesA c t or Order in Council. I am quite sure that the Attorney-General will admit that it would be incompetent for us to interfere in the slightest degree with the Victorian Actor the Order in Council. Of course, he is anxious to get this Bill passed as quickly as possible, and I shall help him to expedite its passage as far as I can, but I do not wish to have an A ct of this Parliament treated as being void and nugatory, while being at the same time misleading to litigants. I shall suggest, when the proper time comes, that clauses 7 and 8 be omitted. There is no need for any",36,Commonwealth Bill Second Reading

178,Mr Higgins,"Yes. Clause7 is ananxiety with regard to giving jurisdiction to our Supreme Courts. In America, however, there was danger in that respect. The condition of the courts in the thirteen States that seceded was simply lamentable, and it was extremely important to have a court where the Judges had a higher tenure and where there was a higher class of work done. But with all their faults the Supreme Courts of these States are as strong as we can expect the High Court to be in the near future. I do not think that if we were to create the High Court to-morrow we should have a better class of men on its bench than we have at present on the benches of the Supreme Courts. I am not raising at this stage the question of whether we ought to create a High Court at present, because I admit that it must be dealt with on a much larger basis and in a different aspect. But whether it is advisable to establish a High Court soon or not we ought not to deprive any man of his right to appeal to the Privy Council. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee : Clause1 (Short title). are three or four amendments of which I have given notice, and if they are carried it will be necessary to amend the short title. nary objection now. This is a B ill distinctly time to consider them properly. The to make temporary provision for enforcing claims against the Commonwealth; at the stage which we have reached, it is not possible for us to consider such an immense enlargement of the order of leave as those amendments require. My honourable and learned friend wishes to introduce claims by the Commonwealth, and, as a glance at his amendments will show when we come to them, he also proposes to introduce provisions to enable actions against States and between States to be dealt with. Each of these means an enormous extension of this measure, as he will admit. AlthoughI am extremely loath to take such an objection learned friend to give me an opportunity of amplifying the scope of the Bill. notice to me, personally, is concerned, he certainly did. If this were an ordinary period of the session I should have been inclined to withdraw my proposal, as as to bring it forward in such a shape as would give my honourable and learned friend an opportunity of discussing his views. But does he really propose at this stage of the session to raise questions of such magnitude? I must sav that I do not think that they can be disposed of. it ? Surely, if the Commonwealth chooses to submit itself to the jurisdiction of the State courts, it can commence an action. learned member also wants to give the Commonwealth power to enter actions against the States, and vice versd. power was put into the Constitution. constitutional power. It is a matter which must be considered when we come to deal with permanent legislation upon the subject. But this is merely a temporary measure, brought in at the close of . the session to carry us on until next year, when the clauses in which the honourable and learned member is so deeply interested, and upon whose effects he is so admirably informed, will require to be dealt with. I should be the last to endeavour to evade their discussion at such a time. The sooner a determination is arrived at with regard to these matters the better. But manifestly it is perfectly I shall take a prelimiimpossible for this Parliament at this honourable and learned member knows that practically the whole of this session has been sacrificed to the necessity for dealing with customs duties, and, under the circumstances, the B ill for the establishment Of the High Court had to be postponed. Surely he does not think that this committee could to-day arrive at a final decision on matters so important as are raised in his amendment ? M i \ REID (East Sydney) -Inasmuch as the amendment referred to would, if made, be inoperative if the Government did not take advantage of it, and inasmuch as it is clear, from what the Attorney-GeneralI asked my honourable and states, that the Government would not take advantage of it , clearly it would be a dead letter, because no proceedings in the name of So far as giving the Commonwealth could, I take it, be had except at the instance of the Federal Government.

186,Mr Deakin,"I do not dispute thewould be impossible at this period of the session, when we have practically only an hour or two hours available, to deal with the matter. The task seems to me to be too great to take up at present. So far as the first amendment is concerned, the fact that the Government are against it, shows that they would not take advantage of it , and therefore it would be idle to pass it . The omission from this Bil l of provisions such as my honourable and learned friend speaks of, however important and pressing they are, will only create the necessity for proper legislation being proposed at the beginning of next session. Of course, there may be some who want to dispense with the High Court altogether or for an indefinite period. I am not one of those; and, in any case, whether that is to be so or not, the matter should be one of tlie first to be settled in the ensuing session of the Parliament. I feel so strongly about the necessity for a short B ill of this kind, to give the fullest remedy against the Commonwealth, that I do not want to imperil the chances of its becoming law this session by going into other matters of greater importance. I am afraid the result might be that we should get no Bill at all if we did that, and I , for one, should regard that as a calamity. with what the Attorney-General and the leader of the Opposition have said. This is an emergency Bill for temporary purposes. man except the members of the Ministry saw to be necessary eighteen months ago. a great deal of very important work to do. They cannot do everything at once. It would be wise not to complicate this Bill with very large questions, that ought not to be settled until we have the fullest opportunity of considering them in all their aspects. It would complicate matters very much indeed if we introduced provisions having, perhaps, for their main object the settlement of disputes of very long standing between States. It is quite sufficient to say that we know-the y have been referred to in the Convention and elsewhere-that there are very deep-seated disputes which have remained in abeyance for a long time, and which ought to be settled by a tribunal that will command the fullest confidence, and in a manner which will, as far as possible, effect a final decision. But to attempt to provide for that at this stage of the session would be to make a great mistake. Apart altogether from the technical difficulties that the Attorney-General has referred to, about the suggested amendment not being within the scope of the title of the Bill-wit h which objection I thoroughly agree-it seems to me that there are substantial reasons why we should not embark upon such a very difficult investigation now. I endorse the suggestion made to my honourable and learned friend, the member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, not to persevere with his amendments to-day, because they would lead to a very long and difficult debate, and we should not, I believe, be able to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. should like to say a few words before the committee finally decide upon this matter. I am very much impressed with what has been said by some of the leading members of this committee as to the undesirableness of precipitating a debate upon matters of such importance at the end of the session. But, unfortunately, it is not my fault that the matter comes up for discussion at this time. Several months have passed since I drew the attention of the Attorney-General to the necessity for carrying amendments to the same effect as those which I have tabled. It is somewhat imperative that the giving of effect to the provision of the Constitution for remedies of States against States should not be postponed too long. For instance, suppose that New South Wales to-morrow wished to stop Yictoria from infringing upon riparian rights. There is no possibility of doing it . There is no court in which the case could be tried. learned member try a case of that kind in the State courts 1 earth is the reason for this fear of the State courts ? In England there are no courts but the courts of the State itself. You could not, in England, have a case tried by the German courts, for instance. Wales would not consent to a test case affecting them being tried in a Victorian court. by my amendments, which are simplicity itself, and also, I believe, efficacy itself.

194,Mr Glynn,"I desire tosettlethat pointseveral pressing matters as to which there is no jurisdiction, and goodness knows when the jurisdiction will be conferred. I would remind the Attorney-General that, so far from those clauses being of a revolutionary character, at the Convention they had the endorsement of the present Prime Minister of Australia, who, when I suggested that such provisions should be embodied as part of the Constitution, supported the idea strongly. Therefore, honourable members will see that I am not bringing forward any novel proposal in asking that this subject should be considered. The Prime Minister was quite willing to embody these provisions in the Constitution itself, and was supported by Sir John Downer and, I think, also by Senatoi"" O'Connor; only Senator O'Copnor came in finally, after Sir Josiah Symon and others had opposed theprovisions, with the suggestion that the power should be handed over to the Parliament. I thought that we should not quickly legislate upon it , but that provision against frivolous actions might be mads such as is made in this Bill. However, I do not wish to be unreasonable. My chief object-for I did not hope that I could carry these important clauses now, at the end of the session -wa s that the matter might be mooted, and that the public might know exactly how we stand in regard to the Judicature. I concur in -thinking that -under present circumstances it might be better to postpone these suggestions of mine to give a remedy for a State against a State and for a State against the Commonwealth until we have time to consider them fully. might also mention that I had intended to alter the wording so as to make it agree with the form which was suggested to me by the drafting committee of the Convention, and which obtained the approval of the committee and of the Prime Minister.

That provision is simplicity itself, and I do not abandon it . One of my amendments is to enable any question that arises under the Constitution, or under any of the Acts passed by this Parliament under the Constitution, to be tried by the Supreme Court of the State, subject, of course, to the ordinary rules of common law ; and from such a court the appeal would go to the Privy Council until we established the High Court. learned member connect that with a Bill for claims against the Commonwealth 1 when this B i ll was introduced, and I think it is relevant to the purpose of the Bill, because it only extends the provisions of the Bill by making it more applicable than it is at present. It does not change the nature of a Bill. However, I do not propose to proceed with the first amendment now. with what has fallen from the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, and I must add that the blame with regard to the introduction of this Bill at this stage must rest upon the shoulders of the Government. AVe, on this side of the chamber, complain very strongly about their action. I have gone over the suggested amendments carefully with the honourable and learned member, and fully concur in the suggestions made by him. Therefore, I had intended to support him. But, as the leader of the OpI position thinks that it is rather too late to discuss the matter now, I shall fall in with his opinion.

214,Sir John Quick,"Quite so. Whereagainst the Government, that right of action ought to be unqualified. In other words, the Governor General should not by his inaction have the power to obstruct the launching of a bona, fide action against the Commonwealth. It may be that power should be preserved to prevent the institution of frivolous actions against the Government that would put them to great expense -for example, a frivolous action brought by a pauper plaintiff. If the amendment is carried-and I see no objection to it some provision should be inserted giving the Attorney-General power to go to the State court and have an action stayed. unless security were given for costs, or some good cause of action shown. to persons having claims against the Governby requiring a nominal defendant to be apment we should open them as they stand.

Nothing ticular Statei n which the cause of action would be lost by making such a provision. arose. We wish, therefore, to go purely If a frivolous action were started it could by local procedure. I presume that in be dealt with. In Victoria we have no each State there is some person who special provision against frivolous actions ; could be nominally sued; for instance, but I remember a petition against the Queen the Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney for about £1,200,000, which was so obvicould be sued in the case which led ously frivolous on the evidence presented to to this Bil l being introduced. The desire the court before trial, that action' was is to have a person made defendant stayed. It always happens that before a who may be readily served with the proman begins to sue the Crown he makes cesses of the court in ' the State in some claim for payment. There are in which the cause of action arises. If the variably some negotiations, and therefore Attorney-General or the Treasurer is made there is no danger of an action going into the nominal defendant, there may be some court because of a want of opportunity for difficulty in the case of an action brought in settlement. The issue of the writ is a very Queensland, unless we can appoint a solicisimple thing, and I fail to see why, in giving tor to accept service after the action has the right to sue, we should not give a right started. I presume the desire is to take to sue as freely as between subject and subadvantage as far as'possible of all local ject.

No man should be at the mercy of the Federal Government as to whether he should be permitted to bring his case before a court or not.

While I agre.e thoroughly with the principle, I ask the honourable and learned member for East Sydney to remember that this is not merely an act of justice, but that there is also an element of concession iu the proposal that the Commonwealth shall submib ibself to a State Court without the right of appeal to a Federal High Court which does not as yet exist. 46 Q if fche High Court were establishedfcheobjection of the honourable and learned member for In d i would be quite as tenable ?

285,Mr Isaacs,That is not what the clause,48,Commonwealth Bill Second Reading
286,Mr Reid,"Does my honourable and the next course open to him is fco appeal to the Privy Council. The clause is not inserted for the benefit of the private litigant, but the object is to put off the final decision of cases in which the Government have been defeated in the States courts. The right of appeal is to be kept alive, so that the Government, instead of going to the Privy Council, may refer to the High Court. If we give the people the right to use their own courts, in order to obtain redress against the Commonwealth Government, according to the laws of the States, why should we postpone the operation of tliose laws with regard to appeals? I never yet heard of any man who obtained a verdict desiring to have the decision of the case postponed for a year or eighteen months, aud the obvious intention of the clause is to give the right to tbe Commonwealth to keep those who obtain verdicts against them in a state of suspense until the end of 1903. while ago that if I thought the operation of this clause would be productive of the dreadful consequences that my right honourable friend has portrayed, I should be very much inclined to agree with the attitude which he has taken up. But I do not understand that it will have any such effect. The position, I take it , is this: If a judgment be given in favour of an individual or plaintiff, it naturally follows that he will not appeal against that judgment. As he will not appeal, he will make no application for a stay of proceedings. It is only in cases where judgment has been given against the plaintiff that he may wish to appeal. right of appeal. Constitution is against it . to appeal, this clause simply confers upon the Attorney-General the power to say, "" I will consider whether this matter involves a constitutional question or a question of importance to the Commonwealth."" Then, as I think, according to the spirit of the Constitution he may ask the court to delay the decision of that appeal until some time not later than the date fixed for the expiration of this measure. Buti n all probability this Bill will be superseded by another measure long before the date fixed for its expiration. I would further point out that section 78 of the Constitution saysThe Parliament may make laws conferring rights to proceed against the Commonwealth or a State in respect of matters within the limits of the judicial power. Those rights may be conferred absolutely or conditionally-eithe r with or without limits. There is no constitutional right of appeal. Therefore, when for a temporary purpose we are conceding to an individual the right to proceed against the Commonwealth Government in the States courts, the Government say to him-""Judgment has been given in your favour, but we must consider whether or not we shall appeal against it . "" that. tion as the right honourable member has portrayed can possibly arise. If a plaintiff obtains a verdict of £1,000 against the Commonwealth, tbe Attorney-General cannot say"" I will prevent you from obtaining that money until after December, 1903."" The Attorney-General must immediately make up his mind whether or not he will appeal. Should he decide to proceed with the appeal, the Supreme Court has power to say to h i m "" You must either pay this money at once, or give us security, as is provided by the Privy Council orders."" member need not trouble to discuss that sort of case. My remarks were applicable only to judgments given against the Commonwealth. visions of the clause do not apply. WhereH e has a right to do so. a judgment is given in favour of an individual, the Attorney-General must at once , make up his mind whether or not he will appeal against it . tribunal cannot be altered and another tribunal substituted. venture to think that that is another question. If the operation of this clause would introduce such a dreadful innovation as the leader of the Opposition seems to fear, I should be absolutely in accord with h i m ; but I do not think that we need apprehend any such consequences. posed before, had I recollected that the leader of the Opposition was absent from",48,Commonwealth Bill Second Reading

Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Minister for Home Affairs) I have been so accustomed in the past to little flourishes of trumpets from the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney that now I do not mind them.

We all know that the Senate, in the case of the Customs Tariff Bill and other measures, adhered to its position up to a certain point, and' then gave way ; and it would be just as reasonable for the leader of the Opposition to.apply to that Chamber the language to which we have just listened.
