Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (Question No. 3580) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 25 May 2006: (1) Did the Government’s evaluation of the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP) determine that an increase of 15% in base funding was required to maintain the level of operation of the system and that a 40% increase was required to meet unmet demand; if so, why did SAAP agencies in NSW receive no extra core funding from the Commonwealth Government in the negotiation of the 5-year SAAP V agreement. (2) What is the Government doing to increase the capacity of SAAP agencies targeting single homeless women to meet demand from the 80% of vulnerable women who request accommodation but are turned away each day. (3) Is it the case that, on average, 2 out of every 3 children needing accommodation are turned away from the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program each day. (4) What is the Government doing to increase the capacity of agencies to respond to the needs of our homeless children. The joint Commonwealth/State National Evaluation of the fourth Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP IV) provided a number of options for the future of SAAP. Although responsibility for the day-to-day administration of SAAP, including the procurement and funding of services, rests with the NSW Government, the Australian Government is very serious about its commitment to support for homeless people. As a result, the Australian Government is making a substantial financial contribution to state and territory governments to assist them meet their obligations in this area. In fact, the Australian Government has committed an additional $100 million in funds for the next five years of the programme. In particular, the Australian Government’s overall contribution to NSW under SAAP V has increased by some $35 million. NSW is not contributing additional funds to SAAP V. However, they are always welcome to do so. SAAP assists some 22,000 people daily with a range of support services, including providing accommodation for accompany children. However, some people are unable to be assisted with SAAP accommodation immediately. The National Data Collection shows that although some families with children are unable to be immediately accommodated in SAAP accommodation, they are assisted with finding alternative accommodation and/or with other support services. The ratio of unmet demand to total demand for accommodation for accompanying children was 2.6 to 100. This means that of the 4,600 children seeking accommodation each day, over 97% are accommodated on the day their parents or carers sought the accommodation. Similarly, according to the Demand for SAAP 2003-04 Report, the ratio of unmet demand to total demand for single women was 1.10 to 100. This means that over 98% of all single women seeking accommodation each day were accommodated on that day. The data showed that most of those unable to",144,Questions In Writing

250,Mr Brough,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:be accommodated by SAAP received some kind of assistance such as referrals to other agencies, financial and material aid, transport and advice or information. Almost $120 million will be available under the SAAP V Agreement for investment and innovation projects aimed at achieving the strategic directions of SAAP V which include providing better pre-crisis intervention, better service system linkages, especially for families and children and better post-crisis transition assistance to achieve lasting outcomes and reduce repeat use of SAAP services. The support provided by these services will enable families to access and maintain stable forms of housing and reduce the risk of longer term family and intergenerational homelessness. As part of the package of mental health assistance measures announced recently by the Prime Minister, the Australian Government will also be providing $284.8 million over five years for 900 personal helpers and mentors to assist people living in the community to better manage their daily activities. As around 30 per cent of current SAAP clients have mental health issues, this additional support should help address some of the demand on SAAP service providers from this client group.

The department offers salary packaging of childcare fees for its employees with children in care at the Currawong Childcare Centre, as well as salary packaging of childcare fees for its employees with children in care at childcare centres associated with other APS agencies, consistent with taxation legislation and rulings. 3.2 The department will reimburse additional childcare costs where employees are required by management to increase their hours of work to cover emergency situations or to meet short term work commitments, including short term missions.” (8) DFAT reimburses additional childcare costs that are incurred as a result of particular work obligations, as outlined in paragraph 3.2 of the Collective Agreement see (7) above. To support staff located overseas in the effective discharge of their representational responsibilities, limited childminding costs can be reimbursed under representation allowance provisions. In some overseas locations household maintenance assistance is provided to staff, who can access a portion of that assistance to meet informal childcare costs. (9) Yes.

The Currawong Childcare Centre is a work-based childcare centre, run primarily for the benefit of employees of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). Therefore, first priority in the allocation of places will be given to DFAT employees. 2. To be eligible to be allocated a place in the centre, a DFAT employee or other person must complete an application for the centre’s external waiting list. In order to make the management of the allocation policy transparent, a points system will be used to determine the ranking of applicants on the external waiting list. All applicants will be awarded points for each priority criterion they meet. Applicants will then be given a cumulative score and ranked according to that score. At any point in time, the applicant with the highest score will be ranked first, the applicant with the second highest score will be ranked second, and so on. When a childcare place becomes available, the applicant ranked first will be offered any available place first. The person ranked second will be offered the next available place, and so on, until all available places are filled. In cases where two or more applicants have the same rank, the place will be offered to the applicant whose application was registered first by the director of the centre. 3. The points system is as follows: Priority Criterion Points At least one parent/legal guardian is a DFAT employee 40 A DFAT family already has a child in the centre 20 Number of months on the waiting list (points accrue for each month) 2 4. In order to support DFAT employees who are asked to return to Canberra from an overseas post or state office at the department’s initiative, and at short notice, to meet the department’s operational requirements, the allocation policy will accord an additional priority to meet the childcare needs of these employees. 5. In accordance with guidelines issued by the Department of Family and Community Services on the allocation of places in childcare services, the director of the centre may give priority consideration on a case-by-case basis to departmental employees whose immediate family includes a person with a disability. 6. An application must include details of the child’s date of birth, an estimated date of birth, or proof of authorisation to adopt. The director of the centre will update the waiting list at least every six months. An applicant on the waiting list who is no longer pregnant, or who no longer has a child to enrol in the centre, forfeits the place on the waiting list but can reapply in accordance with this policy. 7. Applications from persons who are not DFAT employees will be considered only after demand for places in the centre from departmental employees have been met. Any places offered to non-DFAT applicants (including contractors engaged by DFAT) will be of limited duration. Places will be available until 31 December in the year they are offered and will then be subject to review and possible withdrawal should they be required by DFAT applicants. 8. The director of the Currawong Childcare Centre will offer a childcare place to an applicant by telephone or email, and will check to ensure the message is received without delay. If there is no sign that the message has been received, the centre will contact the applicant by other means. The department will assist if necessary. Applicants are requested to respond, if possible, within 24 hours of receiving an offer. If they need more time to consider the offer, they must seek an extension from the centre director. If no prior arrangement has been agreed for a late response, offers will be deemed lapsed 72 hours after receipt. 9. An applicant who does not receive the full number of days originally requested will go on a separate internal waiting list as of the date of registration of the original application. Priority for this list will be in accordance with the order of the date of application for the days sought. When days become available, they will be offered to DFAT applicants first. DFAT applicants whose childcare needs change after the original acceptance of a childcare place will be placed on the separate internal waiting list as of the day they notified the centre of their new care requirements. Priority will be in accordance with the date of application for the new care requirements. 10. In cases where a DFAT employee with a child/children in the centre separates permanently from the department, s/he will be required to notify the director and discuss mutually convenient arrangements for the possible withdrawal of the child from the centre. This should occur no later than 31 December in the year the parent separates from the department, if places are required by DFAT applicants on the waiting list. 11. To facilitate management of the waiting list, DFAT parents posted or transferred to a location outside Canberra are asked to notify the centre of their intended departure date as soon as possible. 12. In the first instance, the director of the centre is responsible for resolving any dispute that may arise in relation to the implementation of this allocation policy. Disputes which cannot be resolved by the director of the centre will be referred to the Assistant Secretary, Staff Development and Post Issues Branch, for consideration and decision. The Corporate Management Division of the department reserves the right to monitor at any time the management of the waiting list. I have read and understood the allocation policy detailed above. I understand that available places at the Currawong Childcare Centre will be allocated according to this policy. Applicant’s Signature ______________________________ Date ____/____/____ Director’s Signature ______________________________ Date Administrative Circular Canberra ACT 0221 Distribution: All staff to see No: P0485 28 March 2003 File No.: 02/211615 Subject: Remuneration Packaging of Childcare Fees at the Currawong Child Care Centre: Entitlement of DFAT Employees to Claim Childcare Benefits (CCB) This circular replaces A/C: P0174 Administrative Circular P0174 of 2 December 1998, informed employees that the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) had provided a private ruling allowing Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) exemption for employer-sponsored childcare at the Currawong Childcare Centre (the Centre). It has been confirmed that this private ruling continues to correctly state the department’s position with respect to the FBT exemption and work-based childcare. 2. The private ruling concludes that the department is able to offer remuneration packaging of the Centre’s childcare fees. The ruling only refers to the Centre, not other forms of childcare (such as other centres, family day care or in-home care provided through an approved child care service). However, legal advice indicates that the FBT exemption would also apply to childcare centres provided at other Commonwealth agencies (i.e. another Commonwealth department or agency of the Commonwealth that cannot be made liable for taxation to the Commonwealth). 3. In paragraph 3 of Administrative Circular P0174, it was noted that employees who chose to package childcare costs at the Centre were not entitled to child care payments such as Child Care Assistance and the Child Care Cash Rebate. These payments have since been replaced by the Child Care Benefit (CCB), but the restrictions remain. It is not possible for DFAT employees to access FBT-exempt remuneration packaging for childcare centres and also be eligible for a CCB. This situation arises as a result of the department directly assuming liability for the fees under a remuneration packaging arrangement. 4. It is possible for employees to enter into a remuneration packaging arrangement where the employee incurs the liability for the childcare fees directly, and is also entitled to the CCB entitlement. However, such an arrangement will not attract the FBT exemption, and may not be cost effective for the employee. 5. Prior to contacting the department to discuss packaging childcare fees, employees should seek independent financial advice on the value of forgoing CCB in preference to utilising the FBT exempt remuneration packaging arrangements. For any matters relating to remuneration packaging you should contact the Executive Officer, Remuneration, Entitlements and Conditions of Service Section (Ext 3313). Doug Chester First Assistant Secretary Corporate Management Division Child Care (Question No. 3686) Ms Plibersek asked the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 19 June 2006: (1) Do any agencies in the Minister’s portfolio offer childcare to employees; if so, which agencies. (2) In respect of agencies that offer childcare, (a) is the childcare (i) long day care, (ii) outside school hours care, or (iii) another type of care, (b) is the childcare facility located at the agency’s premises; if so, (i) what is the maximum capacity of the childcare facility, (ii) is enrolment at the facility available to children whose parents are not employees of the agency, and (iii) do the children of agency employees receive preferential enrolment over the children of non-employees; if so, what are the provisions of the preference rule; and (c) will the Minister provide a copy of the information sheet given to employees seeking employer assistance with childcare. (3) Are employees given the option of salary-sacrificing childcare offered by the agency. (4) How many employees within each of the Minister’s portfolio agencies have made salary-sacrifice arrangements with the employing agency for childcare expenses. (5) In respect of the employees identified in the response to part (5), how many use on site-childcare. (6) Do any of the Minister’s portfolio agencies have salary-sacrifice agreements relating to childcare with employees who do not use the on-site childcare centre; if so, how many agreements of this type are there? (7) Will the Minister provide a copy of the childcare benefits provisions from the Certified Agreements of each of the Minister’s portfolio agencies. (8) What financial assistance for childcare, other than salary-sacrificed fees, is available to employees (including those on AWAs) of each of the Minister’s portfolio agencies. (9) Have any agencies in the Minister’s portfolio sought private or public rulings from the Australian Taxation Office relating to childcare and fringe benefits tax; if so, when. (10) Do any of the Minister’s portfolio agencies have arrangements with other Government agencies to provide childcare to employees, such as sharing childcare facility costs at a site within, or external to, one of the agencies. provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: The FaCSIA portfolio does not offer childcare or childcare benefits to its staff, nor is childcare offered as a salary sacrificing option. FaCSIA does reimburse the reasonable costs of additional family care where staff are required to be away from home. Staff may also be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses such as additional family care in cases where approved leave has been cancelled due to operational reasons. Assessment and Reporting Procedures (Question No. 3724) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, in writing, on 19 June 2006: (1) Has the Government indicated to State and Territory Governments that funding will be withheld if they do not implement the Australian Government Assessment and Reporting procedures. (2) By what date are State and non-government schools expected to comply with the new assessment and reporting procedures. (3) What is the research base that has been used to inform the development of the five point A-E reporting scale. (4) Is the Minister aware that there is a wealth of research which clearly documents the inadequacies and shortcomings of standardised testing and reporting regimes and their negative effect on student learning and achievement. (5) What measures have been taken by the Government to ascertain the effectiveness, reliability and appropriateness of reporting against a very limited and highly specific five point A-E scale. (6) Is the Minister aware (a) that Victoria is currently implementing an innovative new curriculum, the Victorian Essential Learning Standards, following extensive consultation with, and acceptance by, Victorian School communities and (b) that the Government’s assessment and reporting requirements are counter to the flexible assessment principles required by the Victorian Learning Standards that are considered necessary to assure effective learning for every pupil. (7) Is the Minister aware of, and willing to acknowledge, that many teachers, school principals and parent bodies have grave reservations about the impact of the required five point A-E reporting system on student learning and achievement levels. (8) Is the Minister aware that (a) teachers in Victoria are already struggling to do justice to this system and report on just two areas, being Mathematics and English and (b) when all areas of the new Standards have to be reported on, teachers will be required to spend inordinate amounts of time just on meeting the reporting commitments, which will affect the quality of teaching that teachers will be able to deliver.",146,Questions In Writing
252,Mr Brough,"The Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has(9) Does the Minister believe that the Government’s stated objective of “plain English reporting” will be achieved when schools will be required to report about Domains, Dimensions, Strands and Progression Points. Ms Julie Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Each education authority signed a Funding Agreement under the Schools Assistance (Learning Together– Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004 (‘the Act’). Clause3 of each Agreement states that the Australian Government may withhold or suspend a payment until the education authority has performed its obligations under the Agreement, the Act and the Regulations to the Act. The Australian Government has referred to this clause in correspondence to education authorities. (2) The Australian Government requires all schools to provide parents with plain English student reports commencing in 2006. (3) Research by Professor Peter Cuttance and Ms Shirley Stokes of the University of Sydney in 2000 showed that parents want to receive report cards written in plain language that show their child’s achievement relative to objective standards and relative to the achievement of other students in the class. The results of this research are on the website of the Department of Education, Science and Training at this link: http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/school_education/publications_resources/profiles/student_school_achiev ement_report.htm. The Australian Government’s consultations with parents and educators have clearly shown that many parents want to be better informed about their child’s progress in terms they can understand. (4) The Australian Government has developed its policies concerning this issue after considering research and, in particular, after discussions with, and listening to the views of, parents. Assessing students against standards is important to ensure that they are progressing at a suitable rate and that any areas that require development are identified. These standardised assessments can be used for diagnostic purposes. Teachers can use the results to identify students’ strengths and areas of need. Programmes can be modified or developed to meet these needs. Not all areas of learning can be assessed by standardised testing, which is complementary to classbased assessment and teacher judgements in providing a total picture of a student’s development and progress at school. It is important that such reporting mechanisms be meaningfully communicated to parents. (5) The Australian Government’s requirements provide schools and education authorities with flexibility to build on good reporting practices they may be employing in conjunction with meeting the requirements for an assessment against achievement levels or bands labelled A-E or an equivalent. A five point scale (A-E grades or equivalent) tells parents whether their child has achieved well above, above, at, below, or well below the standard expected for their year. For example, the Victorian Government has sought to ensure consistent interpretation of performance at each achievement level across all its government schools, and the Victorian Catholic school system has chosen to use the Victorian Government approach. It has done this by defining A-E grades in terms of year levels. That is, an ‘A’ grade is equivalent to at least 12 months ahead of the year level being assessed, a ‘B’ grade is equivalent to at least 6 months ahead of the year level being assessed, a ‘C’ grade is at the expected standard for the year being assessed; a ‘D’ grade is equivalent to at least 6 months behind the year level being assessed; and an ‘E’ grade is equivalent to at least 12 months behind the year being assessed. (6) (a) I am aware that Victoria is currently implementing the Victorian Essential Learning Standards. (b) Education authorities (including in Victoria) and/or schools are responsible for determining standards against which achievement levels or bands labelled A-E (or an equivalent) are defined. A-E (or equivalent) summative reporting is supported by other forms of reporting which provide evidence of student achievement, and is complementary to prevailing school assessment and reporting practices. I am keen to ensure that the new reporting requirements suit the needs of students and parents. The requirements for plain English student reports provide scope for schools to build on their existing reporting practices to suit their particular circumstances. (7) I am also aware, through the Australian Government’s consultations with parents and educators, that parents want to be better informed about their child’s progress in terms they can understand. (8) (a) I am aware of reports that some teachers in Victoria are experiencing difficulty with reporting on English and Mathematics. I understand the significant challenges facing schools and systems as they implement large scale reforms to curriculum, assessment and reporting, in particular the Victorian Essential Learning Standards. (b) If a subject or key learning area is worth teaching, it is worth assessing and reporting on it. It is reasonable for parents to expect to be provided with good, clear feedback about their child’s progress. (9) Domains, Dimensions, Strands and Progression Points are Victorian government requirements, and are not part of the Australian Government’s plain English student report requirements as set out in either the principles for student reports in the Act or the Regulations to the Act. The sample student reports on the website of the Victorian Department of Education and Training do not mention Domains, Dimensions, Strands and Progression Points. The Australian Government will continue to work with the Victorian Government to ensure that Victoria’s student reports comply with the requirements for plain English reporting. Abortion (Question No. 3868) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 9 September 2006: Further to his reply to part (5) of question No. 3194, why will he not act to amend the Medicare Item numbers so that it is possible, while preserving a woman’s privacy, to determine the exact number of Medicare-funded procedures occurring specifically for the purpose of procuring an abortion. It is usual practice for items in the Medicare Benefits Schedule to describe the medical procedure rather than the reason for the procedure. As such there can often be more than one reason why a particular service is performed. At this stage there is no consideration being given to amending the current arrangements for describing clinical services in the Medicare Benefits Schedule. Medicare (Question No. 3878) Mr Adams asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 10 August 2006: Can he provide an update on elements of Medicare that assist (a) senior Australians, (b) rural and regional Australians and (c) the people of the federal electorate of Lyons.",152,Questions In Writing
253,Mr Abbott,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,154,Questions In Writing
254,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(a) (b) and (c) As part of the Strengthening Medicare package, the Australian Government introduced additional payments to encourage general practitioners (GPs) to bulk bill Commonwealth concession cardholders and children under 16 years of age. These incentives are currently $5.15 in metropolitan areas and $7.85 in rural areas, Tasmania, and eligible metropolitan areas with below average bulk billing rates and below average doctor-to-population ratios. These incentives encourage GPs to bulk bill senior Australians who have pensioner concession cards, and also those who qualify for a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card, including self-funded retirees. GPs in the electorate of Lyons can access the higher incentive of $7.85 when they bulk bill eligible patients. This incentive adds income of around $20,500 each year to a GP who provides an average mix of services. These measures were also complemented on 1 January 2005 by an increase in the rebate for all nonhospital GP attendances from 85% to 100% of the Medicare Schedule Fee. This increased the Medicare rebate for a standard GP consultation by $4.60. Statistics for the June quarter 2006 show that bulk billing for non-referred GP attendances, excluding practice nurse items, has increased to 76.6% – up 10.1 percentage points since the December quarter 2003 (the last complete quarter prior to the introduction of the Strengthening Medicare initiatives). The bulk billing rate of 76.6% in the June quarter is the highest rate for five years. Bulk billing rates for nonreferred GP attendances have now increased in 10 consecutive quarters. The bulk billing rates for non-referred GP attendances for children under 16 years and for persons in rural and remote areas are now at record levels. The rate of bulk-billing for children under 16 years increased to 83.8% and the rate of bulk-billing for persons in rural and remote areas increased to 71.3%, in the June quarter 2006. A nine-year high was also reached for bulk billing of non-referred GP attendances to persons aged 65 years and over in the June quarter 2006, with bulk-billing rates of 86.8% the highest since the June quarter of 1997. Increases in bulk-billing rates for GP attendances in the June quarter 2006, compared with the December 2003 quarter (the last complete quarter before the Strengthening Medicare initiatives), include: New South Wales up 6.6 percentage points to 82.3%; South Australia up 15.2 percentage points to 75.8%; Victoria up 10.9 percentage points to 74.5%; Queensland up 12.5 percentage points to 74.2%; Western Australia up 9.7 percentage points to 72.2%; Tasmania up 21.6 percentage points to 70%; Northern Territory up 2.4 percentage points to 62.6%; and Australian Capital Territory up 12 percentage points to 46.9%. Medicare bulk billing statistics for non-referred GP attendances, by electorate, are published by the Department of Health and Ageing and Medicare Australia, on their respective web sites, on an annual calendar year basis in February/March each year. In calendar year 2005 (year of processing), 76.1% of non-referred GP attendances (excluding practice nurse items) to patients with a Medicare enrolment postcode in the electorate of Lyons were bulk billed, an increase of 4.6 percentage points on calendar year 2004. The Extended Medicare Safety Net was introduced in March 2004 and protects all Australians from high out-of-pocket medical costs incurred for Medicare services outside of hospital. In calendar year 2005, over 4 million Australian families had registered for the Medicare safety nets. In calendar year 2005 (year of processing), 3,682 persons (1,894 families) in the electorate of Lyons received a total of $433,611 in supplementary benefits under the Medicare safety nets. Strengthening Medicare also introduced more services for aged care residents. A new Medicare item now covers comprehensive medical assessments for residents of aged care homes. As of 30 June 2006, over 56,000 of these comprehensive medical assessments had been conducted since their introduction on 1 July 2004. GPs are also being funded to work with aged care homes to improve access for residents of aged care homes and to improve the quality of care for all residents. Currently, every Division of General Practice in Australia has a GP aged care panel in operation. The Supporting Rural and Remote Procedural GPs initiative under Strengthening Medicare provides support for doctors in rural areas to continue providing procedural services. Procedural GPs are being reimbursed up to $10,000 for the cost of two weeks of training each year, with this funding also reimbursing doctors for the costs of employing a locum as, in most cases, doctors would be required to leave their practice to attend training in capital cities. In addition, GPs in rural and remote areas who provide anesthetic, surgical and obstetric procedural services are able to access payments of up to $10,000 a year through the Practice Incentive Program. Rural practices are provided with a rural loading of between 15% to 50% (depending on remoteness of the practice) on top of the procedural payment. From November 2006, the procedural payments for GPs delivering 20 or more babies a year will increase to $17,000 a year. Increased rural retention payments have also been continued under Strengthening Medicare for another four years to recognise the commitment of GPs who provide services to rural and remote communities for extended periods of time. Additionally, the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) includes a number of items that support primary medical care for patients, including older Australians and Australians living in rural and regional areas. Chronic Disease Management In addition to normal GP consultation items, specific items are available for Chronic Disease Management (CDM). In July 2005, new CDM items were added to the MBS which introduced a simplified way for GPs to assist patients in the management of a wide range of chronic (or terminal) conditions. These items are available to patients of any age. They enable the management of a patient’s chronic (or terminal) condition/s to be addressed in a structured format through the development of a GP Management Plan, which includes setting management goals for the patient and identifying the health and care services they require. Where a patient has complex needs the GP is able to coordinate the involvement of multiple health care providers involved in the patient’s care through the development of Team Care Arrangements. Health Assessments for Older Australians (Medicare Items 700 to 706) The Annual Health Assessment for Older Australians provides a Medicare rebate for GPs to undertake a comprehensive assessment of patients aged 75 years and over, or in the case of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients, 55 years and over. These items provide an opportunity to assess the patient’s physical, psychological and social function so that the GP can identify the need for any further intervention and plan preventative health care. Medication Management Reviews (Medicare Items 900 & 903) Medication Management Reviews provide a Medicare rebate for GP services where a GP works in collaboration with a pharmacist to review the medication management needs of patients, either in the community or in residential aged care facilities, who are at risk of medication related problems. Allied Health and Dental Care Initiative (Medicare items 10950 – 10977) The Medicare Allied Health and Dental Care initiative provides rebates for certain allied health and dental care services for patients who have a chronic condition and complex care needs and are managed under a Chronic Disease GP Management plan. Medicare rebates are available to eligible patients for a maximum of five allied health and three dental care services each calendar year. Providers included under the initiative are: Aboriginal health workers; audiologists; chiropodists; chiropractors; dentists (through the dental care plan); diabetes educators; dietitians; exercise physiologists; mental health workers; occupational therapists; physiotherapists; podiatrists; psychologists; osteopaths; and speech pathologists. While the Allied Health and Dental Care initiative is not specifically targeted at older people, almost half of the allied health services have been accessed by people aged 65 years and older. Case Conferences (Medicare Items 734 779) The MBS Case Conference items further support GPs to organise and participate in the care of patients with chronic conditions. Multidisciplinary case conferences are available for patients with at least one chronic medical condition and complex care needs who require a range of different services to support them in the community, in residential aged care, or on discharge from hospital. Around half of all GP case conferences have been provided to people aged 65 years and over. Notes to the Statistics Medicare statistics relate to non-referred GP attendances, excluding practice nurse items, that were rendered on a ‘fee-for-service’ basis and for which claims were processed by Medicare Australia in calendar year 2005. Excluded are details of non-referred GP attendances to public patients in hospital, to Veterans’ Affairs patients and some compensation cases. The Medicare bulk billing and safety net statistics by electorate are based on 2004 electorate boundaries. The electorate statistics were compiled from Medicare data by patient enrolment (mailing address) postcode. Where a postcode overlapped electoral boundaries, data were allocated to electorate using a concordance file showing the proportion of the population of each postal area in each electorate. This can result in some data being erroneously allocated to an adjoining electorate. Data relating to post office box postcodes are excluded from electorate reporting as these cannot be appropriately allocated. Medicare safety nets only apply to non-hospital patient billed services. The statistics on the number of people who received safety net benefits include singles and people in families. Where the patient does not pay the total fee charged by the doctor prior to submitting their account to Medicare for reimbursement through a ‘pay doctor cheque’, Medicare Australia is unable to verify, for safety net purposes, that the total charge has been paid. This is regarded as an unsubstantiated claim. Proof of payment of the full amount charged results in a substantiated claim. The number of people in the table who have received a benefit under the safety net includes only those patients who substantiated their claims and presented a subsequent claim to Medicare Australia. Note that this number is not equivalent to the number of people reaching the thresholds. Medicare safety net information includes payments made under the original Medicare safety net and the Extended Medicare safety net. It is important to note that some people would receive assistance from services outside this electorate, and similarly services located in this electorate may provide assistance to people living in other electorates. Additional information and explanatory notes for bulk billing and safety net statistics are available on the Department’s web site at www.health.gov.au/electoratereports. Medicare Safety Net (Question No. 3880) Mr Snowdon asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 10 August 2006: Can he (a) outline the Medicare Safety Net arrangements, (b) outline measures to ensure that Australians have affordable access to medicines, (c) outline existing measures which ensure that Australians have access to doctors after hours and (d) provide details of taxpayer support for the private health insurance system. (a) A Government-funded safety net to cover all Australians against high out-of-pocket medical costs outside the hospital system was introduced on 12 March 2004. It introduced for the first time a comprehensive Government-funded safety net to cover all Australians against high out-of-pocket medical costs for Medicare-claimable services provided outside hospital. Out-of-hospital services are defined as those services provided to non-admitted patients, such as services conducted in doctors’ rooms, private clinics and private hospital emergency departments. The Australian Government was concerned at the level of out-of-pocket costs that some families and individuals face. Under the extended Medicare safety net, Medicare meets 80% of out-ofpocket costs for Medicare-claimable services provided outside hospital, once annual thresholds are reached. In 2006, the lower threshold is $500 for families entitled to receive Family Tax Benefit (A) and concession cardholders, and the upper threshold is $1,000 for all other individuals and families. Out-of-pocket costs are defined as the difference between fees charged by the doctor and Medicare benefits paid. It should be noted that the safety net covers out-of-pocket expenses for a specific Medicare service, but does not cover other fees or charges levied by the doctor that are not directly associated with the service provided or are not claimable through Medicare. The extended Medicare safety net operates in conjunction with the original Medicare safety net. The original Medicare safety net covers the difference between Medicare benefits paid and the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fee for out-of-hospital services. Once out-of-p ocket costs (representing the difference between these two) accumulate to a threshold of $345.50, Medicare benefits increase to 100% of the schedule fee, rather than the standard Medicare benefit of 85% of the schedule fee. Where the original safety net threshold of $345.50 is reached first, a patient will receive 100% of the schedule fee, and any remaining out-of-pocket costs will continue to accumulate towards the extended safety net threshold relevant to their circumstances. In 2005, the first full calendar year of operation of the extended Medicare safety net, more than 4 million families were registered for the safety nets, and nearly 2 million qualified to receive safety net benefits. More than $280 million was spent through the safety nets helping almost 1.25 million people with higher Medicare rebates in 2005. (b) The Australian Government has introduced a number of policies to ensure that Australians continue to have affordable access to medicines, primarily through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). In 2004-05 the PBS subsidised the dispensing of 170.3 million scripts at a cost to Government of $6 billion. Key features of the PBS that address affordable access to medicines include: sponsors seeking to have drugs listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) must demonstrate that the treatments are clinically effective and cost effective; patients pay co-payments towards the cost of PBS medicines, which balance the contributions of government and patients – the payment to government is currently $4.70 per dispensing for concession card holders and $29.50 for general patients;",154,Questions In Writing
255,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:PBS safety net arrangements protect patients who need very large numbers of prescriptions; there are clear conditions on the use of restricted PBS medicines with particular emphasis on high cost medicine groups; special access arrangements are in place for particular highly specialised drugs and their provision is managed in cooperation with state and territory governments through hospitals; other special programs ensure affordable access, such as the Human Growth Hormone Program and a special Indigenous program; the 12.5% price reduction policy, which took effect in August 2005, promotes value for the taxpayer when generic competition occurs. When the first new generic brand of a drug is introduced, all listed brands of that drug must take a 12.5% price cut and the price reduction flows on to other drugs in the reference price group; and the prices of all PBS-listed medicines are reviewed annually by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority. (c) The Government has a range of programs to support the provision of GP services after hours. Round the Clock Medicare: Investing in After Hours GP Services As a result of the Government’s election 2004 policy “Round the Clock Medicare: Investing in After Hours GP Services”, the Government is providing $555.8 million over five years for: new Medicare items from 1 January 2005 for after hours GP attendances, set at $10 higher than the corresponding in-hours items; and three new grants (operating subsidies, start-up grants and supplementary grants), available through competitive annual funding rounds which commenced in 2004-05, to support both new and established after hours general practice services. The 2006-07 round of Round the Clock Medicare grant funding was advertised in April 2006. (details about the 2006-07 round are available at www.health.gov.au.) More than 160 applications were received and are currently being assessed. To date, some 46 grants across Australia including operating subsidies, start-up grants and supplementary grants have been announced from the 2005-06 and 2004-05 rounds of Round the Clock Medicare grant funding. More grants are expected to be announced in the future. Medicare emergency after hours items The Round the Clock Medicare after hours Medicare items outlined above are in addition to the Medicare items for emergency after hours attendances which were introduced in 1990. The emergency items are intended to remunerate GPs who have to return to their surgery or provide a home visit to a patient who requires immediate treatment, in the after hours period. The $10 Round the Clock Medicare after hours loading introduced from 1 January 2005 was also added to the rebates for the emergency after-hours items. After Hours Primary Medical Care (AHPMC) Program The Round the Clock Medicare grant funding outlined above builds on the Government’s AHPMC Program, which was announced in the 2001-02 Budget. A number of after hours services across Australia continue to receive funding support through the AHPMC Program. Practice Incentives Program (PIP) The PIP After Hours Incentive aims to encourage GPs to provide quality after hours services. There are three tiers of payments for the After Hours Incentive: Tier1 – The practice ensures all regular practice patients have access to 24 hour care, including access to out of hours visits (at home, in a residential aged care facility and in hospital) where it is safe and reasonable for these visits to be provided. Tier2 – Practices must meet Tier1 requirements. Practices with less than 2,000 SWPEs (or Standardised Whole Patient Equivalents) must provide at least ten hours per week of after hours cover for practice patients, while practices with 2,000 SWPEs or more must provide at least 15 hours per week of after hours cover. Tier3 – The practice GPs must provide 24 hour cover, seven days a week, including out of hours visits (at home, in a residential aged care facility and in hospital), where it is safe and reasonable for these visits to be provided. Around 21% of PIP payments are for the After Hours Incentive. This equates on average to around $12,000 per PIP practice. In 2005-06, the total expenditure on the PIP After Hours Incentive was around $56 million. In May 2006, 97% of practices were participating in Tier 1, 66% in Tier2 and 27% in Tier 3. National Health Call Centre Network (NHCCN) The Government is also working with the states and territories to establish a NHCCN. Once established, the NHCCN will enable anyone, anywhere in Australia, to ring for health advice and information 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NHCCN will provide callers with round-the-clock phone access to nurses who will assess their symptoms, how urgently they need to be seen and, if treatment is necessary, where they should be seen (e.g. at a hospital or by a GP). In regional areas, where medical services are not always easily accessible, the NHCCN will provide a readily available source of basic medical advice. The NHCCN is expected to take first calls in July 2007, with national coverage achieved within four years. (d) The Government provides the 30% rebate for all people aged under 65. The rebate is 35% for people aged 65 to 69 and 40% for people aged 70 and over. The rebate applicable to a health insurance policy is based on the age of the oldest person covered by the policy. The estimated total cost of the Private Health Insurance Rebates in 2005-06 was $3,179 million. Medicare (Question No. 3881) Ms Livermore asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 10 August 2006: Can he outline how the Strengthening Medicare package is impacting upon (a) bulk-billing across Australia, including the federal electorate of Capricornia and (b) health care for (i) young Australians, (ii) older Australians and (iii) rural and regional Australians. (a) and (b) As part of the Strengthening Medicare package, the Australian Government introduced additional payments to encourage GPs to bulk bill Commonwealth concession cardholders and children under 16 years of age. These incentives are currently $5.15 in metropolitan areas and $7.85 in rural areas, Tasmania, and eligible metropolitan areas with below average bulk billing rates and below average doctor-to-population ratios. These incentives encourage GPs to bulk bill senior Australians who have pensioner concession cards, and also those who qualify for a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card, including self-funded retirees. GPs in the electorate of Capricornia can access the higher incentive of $7.85 when they bulk bill eligible patients. This incentive adds income of around $20,500 each year to a GP who provides an average mix of services.",158,Questions In Writing
256,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:These measures were also complemented on 1 January 2005 by an increase in the rebate for all nonhospital GP attendances from 85% to 100% of the Medicare Schedule Fee. This increased the Medicare rebate for a standard GP consultation by $4.60. Statistics for the June quarter 2006 show that bulk billing for non-referred GP attendances, excluding practice nurse items, has increased to 76.6% – up 10.1 percentage points since the December quarter 2003 (the last complete quarter prior to the introduction of the Strengthening Medicare initiatives). The bulk billing rate of 76.6% in the June quarter is the highest rate for five years. Bulk billing rates for nonreferred GP attendances have now increased in 10 consecutive quarters. The bulk billing rates for non-referred GP attendances for children under 16 years and for persons in rural and remote areas are now at record levels. The rate of bulk-billing for children under 16 years increased to 83.8% and the rate of bulk-billing for persons in rural and remote areas increased to 71.3% in the June quarter 2006. A nine-year high was also reached for bulk billing of non-referred GP attendances to persons aged 65 years and over in the June quarter 2006, with bulk-billing rates of 86.8% the highest since the June quarter of 1997. Increases in bulk-billing rates for GP attendances in the June quarter 2006, compared with the December 2003 quarter (the last complete quarter before the Strengthening Medicare initiatives), include: New South Wales up 6.6 percentage points to 82.3%; South Australia up 15.2 percentage points to 75.8%; Victoria up 10.9 percentage points to 74.5%; Queensland up 12.5 percentage points to 74.2%; Western Australia up 9.7 percentage points to 72.2%; Tasmania up 21.6 percentage points to 70%; Northern Territory up 2.4 percentage points to 62.6%; and Australian Capital Territory up 12 percentage points to 46.9%. Medicare bulk billing statistics for non-referred GP attendances, by electorate, are published by the Department of Health and Ageing and Medicare Australia, on their respective web sites, on an annual calendar year basis in February/March each year. In calendar year 2005 (year of processing), 65.7% of non-referred GP attendances (excluding practice nurse items) to patients with a Medicare enrolment postcode in the electorate of Capricornia were bulk billed, an increase of 6.6 percentage points on calendar year 2004. The Extended Medicare Safety Net was introduced in March 2004 and protects all Australians from high out-of-pocket medical costs incurred for Medicare services outside of hospital. In caleandar year 2005, over 4 million Australian families had registered for the Medicare safety nets. In calendar year 2005 (year of processing), 9,435 persons (4,577 families) in the electorate of Capricornia received a total of $1,427,021 in supplementary benefits under the Medicare safety nets. Strengthening Medicare also introduced more services for aged care residents. A new Medicare item now covers comprehensive medical assessments for residents of aged care homes. As of 30 June 2006, over 56,000 of these comprehensive medical assessments had been conducted since their introduction on 1 July 2004. GPs are also being funded to work with aged care homes to improve access for residents of aged care homes and to improve the quality of care for all residents. Currently, every Division of General Practice in Australia has a GP aged care panel in operation. The Supporting Rural and Remote Procedural GPs initiative under Strengthening Medicare provides support for doctors in rural areas to continue providing procedural services. Procedural GPs are being reimbursed up to $10,000 for the cost of two weeks of training each year, with this funding also reimbursing doctors for the costs of employing a locum as, in most cases, doctors would be required to leave their practice to attend training in capital cities. In addition, GPs in rural and remote areas who provide anesthetic, surgical and obstetric procedural services are able to access payments of up to $10,000 a year through the Practice Incentive Program. Rural practices are provided with a rural loading of between 15% to 50% (depending on remoteness of the practice) on top of the procedural payment. From November 2006, the procedural payments for GPs delivering 20 or more babies a year will increase to $17,000 a year. Increased rural retention payments have also been continued under Strengthening Medicare for another four years to recognise the commitment of GPs who provide services to rural and remote communities for extended periods of time. Notes to the Statistics Medicare statistics relate to non-referred GP attendances, excluding practice nurse items, that were rendered on a ‘fee-for-service’ basis and for which claims were processed by Medicare Australia in calendar year 2005. Excluded are details of non-referred GP attendances to public patients in hospital, to Veterans’ Affairs patients and some compensation cases. The Medicare bulk billing and safety net statistics by electorate are based on 2004 electorate boundaries. The electorate statistics were compiled from Medicare data by patient enrolment (mailing address) postcode. Where a postcode overlapped electoral boundaries, data were allocated to electorate using a concordance file showing the proportion of the population of each postal area in each electorate. This can result in some data being erroneously allocated to an adjoining electorate. Data relating to post office box postcodes are excluded from electorate reporting as these cannot be appropriately allocated. Medicare safety nets only apply to non-hospital patient billed services. The statistics on the number of people who received safety net benefits include singles and people in families. Where the patient does not pay the total fee charged by the doctor prior to submitting their account to Medicare for reimbursement through a ‘pay doctor cheque’, Medicare Australia is unable to verify, for safety net purposes, that the total charge has been paid. This is regarded as an unsubstantiated claim. Proof of payment of the full amount charged results in a substantiated claim. The number of people in the table who have received a benefit under the safety net includes only those patients who substantiated their claims and presented a subsequent claim to Medicare Australia. Note that this number is not equivalent to the number of people reaching the thresholds. Medicare safety net information includes payments made under the original Medicare safety net and the Extended Medicare safety net. It is important to note that some people would receive assistance from services outside this electorate, and similarly services located in this electorate may provide assistance to people living in other electorates. Additional information and explanatory notes for bulk billing and safety net statistics are available on the Department’s web site at www.health.gov.au/electoratereports. Remuneration Tribunal (Question No. 3883) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in writing, on 10 August 2006: (1) How are members of the Remuneration Tribunal appointed and what qualifications are required for appointment. (2) Upon what basis was John Allen appointed as a member of the Remuneration Tribunal in 2003. (3) Is the Minister aware that Mr Allen was, and remains, an instrumental member of the Higgins 200 Club, a key fundraising vehicle for the Treasurer. (4) Was Mr Allen’s membership of the Higgins 200 Club a factor in the decision to appoint him as a member of the Remuneration Tribunal. (5) Is he aware that after the Treasurer assumed office in 1996, Mr Allen became Chairman of the Higgins Electorate Council. (6) Was Mr Allen’s Chairmanship of the Higgins Electorate Council a factor in the decision to appoint him as a member of the Remuneration Tribunal. (1) to (6) The Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 sets out certain requirements for appointment to the Tribunal. The Australian Government’s appointment process is designed to ensure that appointments receive full and proper consideration, and that appointees are appropriately qualified, possess experience relevant to the position and meet any requirements that may be expressed in the relevant legislation. Herceptin (Question No. 3895) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 10 August 2006: (1) Can he confirm that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has recommended that Herceptin be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for women with early stage HER2 breast cancer; if not, why not. (2) Has he seen the article titled ‘Government in talks to put Herceptin on PBS’, which appeared in The Age on 17 July 2006 and in which he is reported as saying that Herceptin “will get expedited consideration by Cabinet”; if not, why not. (3) Will Cabinet make a decision to list Herceptin on the PBS for women with early stage HER2 breast cancer by October 2006; if not (a) why not and (b) when will a decision be made. (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) (a) and (b) On 22 August 2006, I announced that the Government had accepted a recommendation from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) to list the drug trastuzumab (Herceptin®) on the PBS for the treatment of patients with HER-2 positive early stage breast cancer. The drug will be listed from 1 October 2006. It will be used following surgery, commenced initially with adjuvant chemotherapy, and continued for a maximum period of 12 months. Consultancy Services (Question No. 3914) Mr Bowen asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 14 August 2006: Has the Minister’s office, or any department or agency in the Minister’s portfolio, engaged any consultant or other form of external assistance in the preparation of any speech to be made by the Minister in the financial year 2005-06.",160,Questions In Writing

Mr Ian MacfarlaneThe answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: No. Medicare: Bulk-Billing (Question No. 3946) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 16 August 2006: What is the current bulk billing rate for the federal electorate of Griffith. Medicare bulk billing statistics for non-referred GP attendances, by electorate, are published on an annual calendar year basis in February/March. In 2005, 66% of non-referred GP attendances to persons in the federal electorate of Griffith were bulk billed. Notes to the Statistics This statistic relates to non-referred GP attendances, excluding practice nurse items, that were rendered on a ‘fee-for-service’ basis and for which claims were processed by Medicare Australia in 2005. Excluded are details of non-referred GP attendances to public patients in hospital, to Veterans’ Affairs patients and some compensation cases. The statistic is based on 2004 electorate boundaries.

Organ Harvesting (Question No. 3975) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 4 September 2006: (1) Has he seen the document titled Report into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China by Mr David Matas and former Canadian Cabinet Minister, Mr David Kilgour.",163,Questions In Writing
260,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) What information does he have regarding allegations made in this report that China is engaged in the systematic murder of imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners for the purpose of harvesting kidneys, livers, corneas and other organs, for profit. (3) What steps has he taken to ascertain the truth of the allegations referred to in Part 2. (4) Has he raised the issue of alleged organ harvesting with the Chinese authorities; if so, (a) when and in what circumstances and (b) what was the response of the Chinese authorities; if not, will he do so. (5) Has he raised the issue of the large-scale arrest and imprisonment of Falun Gong practitioners with the Chinese authorities; if so, (a) when and in what circumstances and (b) what was the response of the Chinese authorities; if not, will he do so. (6) Did he issue instructions that, in order not to offend the Chinese Embassy, no Government Members or Senators were to attend the briefing given on 16 August by Mr David Kilgour and Mr Edward McMillan-Scott MEP at Parliament House. (1) Yes. (2) The Government is aware of differing assessments of the allegations of widespread organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners. Mr Kilgour and Mr Matas concluded the allegations were true, but others have come to different conclusions. US Embassy and Consular officials visited Sujiatun, the location most frequently referred to in Falun Gong media reports, and found no evidence that the site was being used for any function other than as a normal public hospital. Harry Wu, a renowned activist on human rights in China, had his contacts examine Sujiatun and the surrounding area over the course of three weeks from 12 March. These contacts produced several reports and photographs from their investigations, which Mr Wu says show no signs of a “concentration camp”. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Mr Manfred Nowak, said in March that he would look into the allegations and submit a report to the Chinese Government if he found that the allegations were well-founded. He has not so far submitted any report. Reputable human rights organisations have issued no public comment to date. (3) My Department has sought information from and exchanged views with other governments, reputable human rights organisations, and the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture. A senior DFAT official also met Mr Kilgour during his recent visit to Australia and discussed the report with him. (4) Yes. (a) My Department raised this issue with China during our annual human rights dialogue on 25 July 2006, and suggested that China address the allegations by allowing an independent, credible investigator unfettered access to facilities of his/her choosing. Australian officials have since reiterated this suggestion to the Chinese. (b) The Chinese said the allegations were fabrications. (5) Yes. The Government strongly opposes China’s ban on Falun Gong and its treatment of Falun Gong practitioners, which we consider breach fundamental human rights, including the rights of assembly and free expression. (a) We have raised China’s treatment of Falun Gong practitioners regularly since Falun Gong was banned in 1999. We have done this through our annual human rights dialogue, through our Embassy in Beijing and during high-level visits. I raised the issue myself during a meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Mr Li Zhaoxing, during his visit to Australia in April this",164,Questions In Writing

(6) No. Australia Post (Question No. 3977) Mr Danby asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 4 September 2006: (1) Did the Minister approve Australia Post’s decision to abolish its economy air parcel service from September 2006; if so, what consultation, if any, was undertaken with export-oriented businesses, such as small publishers, about the effect of this decision upon their profitability; if no consultation was undertaken, why not. (2) If the Minister did not approve the decision referred to in Part 1, will the Minister ask Australia Post to review its decision. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question based on information provided by Australia Post: (1) No. As a Government Business Enterprise, Australia Post’s board of directors and management are responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation and do not require ministerial approval for changes such as this. Australia Post is required, as far as practicable, to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice. Australia Post’s board determines the terms and conditions, including rates of postage, of the services supplied by Australia Post. Australia Post has advised that it undertook extensive market research before making its decision. In relation to the possible impact of the decision on export-oriented businesses, Australia Post has advised that the international parcels business operates in a fully deregulated environment with Australia Post offering a commercial service in competition with a range of other service providers. Post currently has a commercial agreement with the Australian Booksellers Association which provides significant discounts for members on published prices. The current agreement is due to expire at the end of October and negotiations on new contractual arrangements have begun. Other export-oriented businesses with regular international parcel despatches may be in a position to negotiate special contract rates with Australia Post. (2) See the answer to part (1). Sudan (Question No. 3979) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 4 September 2006: (1) Can he confirm reports that (a) China is the largest supplier of arms to Sudan, including assault helicopters, armoured vehicles, trucks and small arms and (b) Sudan continues to use these arms to attack civilian villages in the Darfur region. (2) Can he confirm reports that Chinese oil companies, such as the China National Petroleum Corporation, allow their airfields in Sudan to be used by Sudanese government forces in launching air attacks on villages in Sudan.",165,Questions In Writing
262,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts(3) Can he confirm that China has consistently obstructed all efforts at the United Nations to impose sanctions on Sudan and all other efforts to stop the Sudanese regime’s campaign of genocide in Darfur, which has so far cost an estimated 450,000 lives. (4) What is the Government’s position on the reported actions of the Chinese government in respect of Sudan. (5) What steps has he taken to convey his Government’s views to the Chinese Government. (6) What actions has Australia taken at the United Nations, and elsewhere, to bring to an end the genocidal campaign of the Sudanese regime in Darfur. (1) I am aware of the reports, but cannot confirm the details. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, from 1995 to 2005 most of Sudan’s military arsenal came from Russia and not China. Nevertheless, China is a major arms exporter, and it is widely understood that China is the source, either directly or indirectly, of many of the weapons and other items of equipment employed in the ongoing conflict in Sudan. (2) I am aware of the reports, but cannot confirm them. (3) China has resisted efforts to apply international pressure on the Government of Sudan. But China has allowed the passage of a number of United Nations Security Council resolutions addressing the situation in Darfur by not exercising its veto power. (4) The Government is very concerned about the situation in Darfur. We would be disturbed by any activities which exacerbated the situation. (5) China is well aware of Australia’s views. The Australian Government is a strong advocate of responsible arms exports, including exports with assurances about the end-user and purpose for the export, and has regular exchanges with China on these issues through our bilateral arms control and regional security dialogue. Australia also conducts outreach activities with China on a range of arms control issues, including through the Wassenar Arrangement and the Australia group. (6) Australia is not a member of the United Nations Security Council but we did call for, and have supported, strong Security Council action on Darfur. Australia was active in ensuring the Security Council, through Resolution 1591 of 29 March 2005, implemented an arms embargo in Darfur, established a no-fly zone over Darfur and imposed travel bans and asset freezes on individuals who impede the peace process or commit crimes or atrocities. Australia also supported the UN Security Council’s Resolution 1593 of 31 March 2005 which referred crimes committed in Darfur to the International Criminal Court (ICC), of which Australia was a key proponent. UN Security Council Resolution 1672 of 25 April 2006 imposed financial and travel sanctions on four individuals because of their activities in Darfur. One of those four is a Regional Commander in the Sudanese Air Force. Australia is in the process of implementing these sanctions against those four individuals. The Government welcomes the UN Security Council’s Resolution 1706 of 31 August 2006 calling for the transition of the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) to a United Nations force by no later than 31 December 2006. We call on the Government of Sudan (GoS) to accept United Nations peacekeepers in Darfur and we call on the international community to urge the GoS to accept the transition of AMIS to a United Nations force. Convention on Biological Diversity (Question Nos 3986 to 3988) Mr Price asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, in writing, on 4 September 2006:",166,Questions In Writing
263,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Further to the reply by the Minister for Foreign affairs to question no. 3636 (Hansard, 10 August 2006, page 150): (1) Have there been any meetings to discuss the de facto ban placed on Terminator (seed sterilisation) Technology in 2000 as part of the Convention on Biological Diversity; if so (a) when and (b) did Australia participate; and if so, (i) which Australian departments and agencies participated and (ii) what, if any, instructions were given to Australian representatives; (2) Has Australia responded to the de facto ban on terminator technology, if not, why not; if so, in what way; and (3) Has Australia placed a permanent ban on the research, development and use of Terminator seeds; if not, why not. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (a) The issue of Genetic Use Restriction Technologies (GURTs), sometimes referred to as terminator technologies, was most recently considered under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) during the eighth Conference of the Parties (COP 8), which was held in Brazil from 20-31 March 2006. (b) Yes. (i) The Australian delegation was led by the Department of the Environment and Heritage and included participation by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and the South Australian Department of the Environment and Heritage. (ii) In relation to GURTs, the Australian delegation’s position was to support the existing CBD recommendation made in 2000. (2) There is no international ban or moratorium on the technology under the CBD. COP 8 reaffirmed Decision V/5 of the Fifth CBD Conference of the Parties (COP 5) held in Nairobi, Kenya from 15 26 May 2000. The COP 5 decision recommended that products incorporating such technologies should not be approved by Parties for field testing until appropriate scientific data can justify such testing, and for commercial use until appropriate, authorized and strictly controlled scientific assessments have been carried out. The Gene Technology Act 2000 provides a comprehensive system for regulating genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in Australia, to protect human health and the environment. Any application to release a GURT in Australia would be the subject of a scientific assessment of risks, on a caseby-case basis under the Gene Technology Act 2000, as is the case for any other GMO. This approach is consistent with the recommendations and decisions of the CBD. (3) No. See (2) above. Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (Question No. 4073) Ms Hoare asked the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 5 September 2006: (1) Can he confirm that since September 2001, the upper qualifying income threshold for non-Age Pension recipients for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC) has remained at $50,000 per annum for singles and $80,000 per annum for couples. (2) Is he aware that between the last increase in the upper income threshold for the CSHC in September 2001, and 2003-04, it is estimated that the income level of self-funded retirees rose by an average of 25 percent. (3) Can he confirm whether this rate of increase continued to 2005-06, resulting in an average 46 percent increase in the income of self funded retirees between 2000-01 and 2005-06.",167,Questions In Writing
264,Mr Truss,"The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following an(4) Is he aware that recipients of the CSHC are losing their entitlement as their retirement incomes rise in line with the national average; if so, will he increase the upper qualifying income threshold for CSHC eligibility; if not, why not. The CSHC is one of a small number of Australian Government concession cards that can be issued to people who are not receiving a social security payment, and is intended to support and encourage selfprovision in retirement. The current CSHC income thresholds are $50,000 for singles and $80,000 combined for couples, with no assets test. Almost 85 per cent of people over Age Pension age qualify for an Australian Government concession card under the current arrangements. The CSHC income limits were indexed until 1999, when they were raised significantly, and indexation ceased. This increase to the limits was substantial – from $21,320 to $40,000 for singles, and from $35,620 to $67,000 combined for couples. In July 2001, the income limits were again increased to the current levels. If the CSHC income limits had remained linked to the CPI, they would now be $36,991 for a single person and $61,906 for a couple, far less than the current limits. International Labour Office (Question No. 4104) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in writing, on 6 September 2006: In respect of the International Labour Office:(a) when did the department close its Geneva office; (b) why was the Geneva office closed; (c) when was the decision made to re-open the Geneva office; (d) why was the Geneva office re-opened; (e) how many staff will be employed in the new office; (f) where is the new office located; (g) how was the Director of the new office selected; (h) what is the period of appointment for the Director of the new office; (i) what is the projected operating cost of the new office for each of the next four financial years; and (j) what is the rent payable for the Director’s residence. (a) and (b) The former Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) did not have an office in Geneva. Special Labour Advisers appointed by the Australian Government from 1973 to 1996 were officers of DIR seconded to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva. On2 May 1996 the then Minister for Industrial Relations, the Hon Peter Reith MP, informed the House of Representatives that the Special Labour Adviser would be withdrawn from Geneva as a budget saving measure. (c) (d) and (f) The Department has not reopened or established an office in Geneva. The Australian Government decided in 2003 to engage more closely with the ILO. Against that background, funding was provided by Government through the 2005-06 additional estimates to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (the Department) for the attachment of a Departmental officer to Australia’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva to represent Australia’s interests at the ILO. The funding formed part of the additional funding associated with the Government’s workplace relations reforms. The Departmental officer is attached to Australia’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva. (e) No further staff have been engaged by Australia’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva as a result of the Departmental officer being attached to the Mission. (g) Consistent with the practice adopted in respect of the appointment of Senior Labour Advisers between 1973 and 1996, the Department gave careful consideration to the skills and expertise of senior departmental officers before selecting an officer well qualified to represent Australia’s interests at the ILO.",168,Questions In Writing

266,Mr Andrews,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(h) The appointment is for an initial period of two years with an option to extend to three years. The Departmental officer took up the appointment in August 2006. (i) The projected annual operating cost of the Departmental officer attached to Australia’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva for each of the next three financial years is AUD62,150 per annum (excluding capital establishment costs) or AUD66,250 per annum (including capital establishment costs amortised over a 3 year period). Figures are unavailable for the fourth year as the appointment is for a period of up to three years. Other costs include the officer’s remuneration package and a range of conditions and allowances. These conditions and allowances are consistent with those paid by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to officers posted overseas and vary depending on the officer’s personal circumstances. (j) The annual rent payable for the Departmental officer’s residence is CHF 127,980, which at the current exchange rate is approximately AUD132,000 per annum. This provides accommodation of a standard commensurate with that provided for other Senior Executive Service officers at the Geneva post.

(3) I am aware that the China Family Planning Agency has admitted that some forced abortions were carried out by local officials. I understand the agency promised disciplinary action, but I am not aware whether any punishments have been carried out in these cases.

(5) The Government regularly expresses to China our concerns about continuing shortcomings in China’s legal system, including the lack of judicial independence. We do this through our annual human rights dialogues, and through our Embassy in Beijing. We also regularly raise our concern about China’s use of torture, including to obtain evidence. We did this most recently at our human rights dialogue on 25 July 2006.
