For what reason did the Commandant in Victoria issue the order preventing candidates from seeing their examination papers after they had been handed in ? 2. When was such order rescinded, and when and in what way was such rescinding published ? 3. Can the junior members of Boards of Examination endorse on the report of the Board any opinion adverse to that of the President? 4. Has such an endorsement ever been made? the honourable member's questions are: _ 1. Formerly Commonwealth Military Regulations provided for candidates being allowed to see their answers after correction, but as this provision is now omitted from the syllabus the Commandant presumed the old practice would be discontinued. 2. A verbal order was issued by the Ad jutantGeneral on 20th August, which is now being given effect to by the Commandant. 3. Yes. 4. No instance is known. of Defence, upon notice1. Is not the admission by the Minister (made in answer to questions recently asked by the honourable member for Wannon) that rjjg officers had to wait from three months to two years for completion of their examinations, some explanation of the fact that the Forces are underofficered ? 2. Are not the long delays in examining officers evidence of the inertness of the Examining Board? the honourable member's questions are:1 No. Eveni f an officer had not qualified -in accordance with the regulations, he continues to perform the duty pending examination. 2. No. The cause has already been explained in answer to questions on the subject asked by the honourable member f o i Wannon on the 25th of Defence, upon notice1. When a vacancy has occurred and there is an officer thoroughly qualified to fill it in the same corps should not that qualified officer's commission on promotion be dated back to the date See also reply on which such vacancy occurred? 2. If such a vacancy occurs and an officer qualifies theoretically, for promotion to fill the vacancy, but has to wait for some time before he qualifies practically through no fault of his own, should not his commission on promotion be dated back to the date on which he passed his theoretical examination ? 3. If not, should it under any circumstances bear date later than the date on which he passed his practical examination ? the honourable member's questions are : r. Not necessarily. For instance, circumstances might arise in which a qualified officer was unable to take up duty on the date that the vacancy occurred. Defence, upon notice2. Except under very special circumstances an officer should not receive substantive promotion until he has completed his examination for the rank. This is laid down in the Defence Act, section 21. 3. Yes. There are many circumstances in which this would occur. of Defence, upon notice1. Is it not a fact that in the past two years in the Melbourne district the Scottish Regiment and the Victorian Rifles have been the only corps selected for examination parades, although there are two Militia Regiments of f u l l strength available? 2. Why have these two corps been so often selected ? the honourable member's questions are: 1. No. 2. Because it so happened that the nature and times of their parades fitted in with the requirements of the examinations. Defence, upon notice-r1. Who were the gentlemen appointed to select the mechanics, & c , from the applicants for employment in the Small Arms Factory? 2. To whom should applicants apply ? the honourable member's questions are : 1.

124,Tellers : Mr Josep H Cook (Parramatta,"been there sufficiently long to know how urgent this matter of defence reform really is. I venture to say, also, that however short may have been the period of my administration, I have been at the Department sufficiently long to know that there are a great many things which want righting. In saying so much, I believe that I shall have the cordial concurrence of the public at large. I venture, also, to say that the public will not much longer brook delay in connection with reforming the defence of Australia. Australia is not the only country which is anxious in regard to the subject. The whole civilized world seems to be anxious in reference to tliis question, and appears to 'be straining every nerve to make itself as efficient and scientific in all those engines of war which make for the destruction of human life; all are impelled by one motive-the safety of its several races and peoples. Every nation is arming to the teeth, and there seems to be a mad race between the nations of the world as to who shall get the best engines of destruction and who shall be able first to be in the field when the great arbitrament of war is resorted to. the House with figures proving this to be the case so far as the Continent of Europe is concerned, because honourable members are well aware of what is taking place there. With all this turmoil and trouble going on in every part of the world, there arises the question of our own obligation in respect of the defence of Australia and the great Empire of which it is a part. We are grown to manhood now, and it is time that we looked the. question of defending ourselves fairly and squarely in the face. the last few years the point of view has changed for us. It has changed equally for the Mother Country; indeed, for every portion of the British Empire. Great Britain has settled for us all questions of peace or war, all questions of foreign relations, while we have been left in security to develop the national estate, to pioneer and people this great continent of ours. We have developed an immense trade, and grown rich. So far we have never had to carry a gun on any boat; we have only had to fly the flag for the trade to be absolutely secure. Whilst this has been proceeding we have been enabled to build up a financial and racial fabric which, I hope, in the future will be, as the honourable member for Wentworth pithily put it the other day, a buttress to the Empire, instead of a burden upon it. Naturally, we have to go to Mr Joseph Cook. every part of the world to find markets for our enormous trade. Our Empire is a world-wide one; our trade has world-wide ramifications; and wherever we touch a point to discharge our goods and find a market, there for us is a point of possible frictiona point which may affect profoundly the dispositions we have to make regarding the defence of Australia. While we have been enjoying within our borders all those excellent social conditions which make our state the envy of the world, Great Britain has been largely footing the bill for their preservation. It is time that that condition of things ceased. It is not creditable to us. It is not ministering to our selfrespect. We have set up a White Australia ideal. I hope that that ideal will always be looked to and guarded by all those who have to do with the government of this country. But we are depending for its maintenance upon a country which is not able to close its doors to the coloured labour of the world as we do. We are depending upon a nation which opens its doors wide to the world. I question I need not trouble very much whether we have a right to continue to depend absolutely upon that protection alone while we pursue the ideals that we are able to do here-ideal s of a very different character from theirs. We have the eight-hours' system. That cloes not obtain in Great Britain nearly so generally as it obtains here. Must we longer depend upon the protection of Great Britain for the maintenance of the eight-hours' system while the people of that country are not able to win it for themselves? I have said frequently Within that the question of the defence of Australia is essentially a question for working men. They of all others should take a keen interest in all matters which Hitherto have to do with the guarding of our coasts. It is time, as I have already said, that we stood up to our responsibility in this matter. How stands the case at present? While we have been enjoying all the freedom which has enabled us to build up the prosperity we have, other nations have been busily engaged in multiplying their engines of war and perfecting their war machines generally. In particular three nations call for notice-the United States, Japan and Germany. Each of those nations has developed a powerful navy of its own. The two former are not very far away from our own doors, whilst the latter is causing very much anxiety at Home. Honourable members cannot direct their attention to the Pacific in particular without being struck by the forces which are developing in those waters, and the unequal distribution of those forces. Of course, it is all accounted for by reason of Great Britain depending upon its treaty with Japan. Here is the disposition of the forces in the Pacific so far as I can ascertain. has none; Japan fifteen, and America one. Of armoured cn-isers Great Britain has four, Japan twelve, and the United States eleven. Other types of ship are in proportion. As a matter of fact, we are dependent absolutely upon the treaty with Japan, which I believe will be loyally honoured so long as it continues. parties, as is the case with every other treaty. pends entirely for its security upon treaties, and that is our position at this moment. Having regard to the disposition of armed forces in the Pacific it is time for us to see what is our duty as an integral portion of the Empire. So far as I can ascertain, the waters of the Pacific are now as important from a naval point of view as are the waters of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. I need not multiply quotations from the best authorities to show this. They all concur on this point. I have here a. quotation from Captain Mahan, with which perhaps I need not trouble the House, and which shows that we mugt look to the Pacific for naval developments of a very serious character indeed. offer, the New Zealand offer of a Dreadnought, Sir John Colomb is reported to have saidMuch as he hoped that amity with the United States would be long continued, he declined to base the British naval policy upon pious hopes. With every hope for continued amity they could not ignore the development there, and they must have regard to their own position in the Pacific. Take for another example Japan. . . . He asked his honourable friend not to shirk this question of the future of the Pacific. The Pacific formed one-half of the world of water, and British interests in trade ancl commerce, and OUT hopes and aspirations for the future, were hugely in excess of those of every other nation in the world, and yet they were expected to hold that hemisphere with no primary base. The Power lhat controlled the Pacific one day, would control the Indian Ocean the next. It is to be feared the golden opportunity of facing the question of the British maritime position in the Pacific, and initiating a policy of co-operation to provide for its maintenance will be lost. What is needed there, is a primary naval base for producing and sustaining British predominance of maritime power in that hemisphere. It will take long years to establish, and that is all the more reason for making a real beginning. There are many other statements to the same effect; but I do not wish to multiply quotations. Another fact which we cannot ignore is the existence, not far from our Of battleships Great Britain shores, of 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 of the best trained troops in the world. They belong to a nation ft'hose ideals are, in many respects, as unlike our own as it ispossible for them to be. Outlying territories, unless adequately defended, are, in a sense, a source of weakness. Australia is the most distant, the richest, and, at the same time, the most vulnerable part of theBritish Empire. Half-a-dozen mighty kingdoms could find accommodation on this continent, ancl we are surrounded by nations hungering for room and breathing space. British commerce is world-wide, and the protection of our trade must therefore give us great concern. Many ]aersons have attempted to forecast the strategical necessities of the Empire, and have expressed most confident opinions as to what ought to be done in its defence; but the greatest anxiety on this score obtains in the highest quarters. Mr Haldane, than whom Great Britain has not had a better War Minister, spoke in this way on the subject, only a little while agoI once very rashly said in the House of Commons that I did not know how to forecast the strategical necessities of the Empire; I should not have said it. I meant to speak ironically, but then I am a Scotchman, and the House of Commons does not always understand a ScotchI n discussing, just prior to our man. They said, "" Poor man; if he would only ask the soldiers."" Well, I had asked the soldiers; and it was under a deep sense of depression from the result of my communications that 1 made the incautious remark. I have since considered that question, and I again say to-day, after two years' further consultation with soldiers, that I do not know how to forecast all the possible strategical necessities of this Empire. It is so vast; the permutations and combinations that are conceivable against us are s'> manifold, that I can conceive of a dozen things in which I believe that not even all the resources to which we might attain could cope with the situations that might arise. The right thing has been done by those at the seat of the Empire in consulting as to future action with representatives of its other parts. Sir John Colomb, before the Imperial Defence Conference was held, wrote as follows : The' true answer to New Zealand seems to be this :-We, in islands in the north of one hemisphere, are equally prepared to co-operate with you dwellers in islands in the south of the other,",23,Suspension Of Standing

Mr jfOSEPH COOK I am not discussing the question of whether the standard reached by British blue-jackets is higher or lower than that reached by our own naval men. are the equal of the British men, so much the better. I believe that our naval men .are the equal of any to be found elsewhere, so far as their opportunities for training go. That is all that I desire to say. I believe it will be found that the Australian seamen will develop all those characteristics which have made the. seamen at Home famous. It has been said that the Australians do not take kindly to the sea. I do not believe that statement for a moment. What is lacking in Australia is opportunity and encouragement-the acquirement of that training which has furnished the inestimable material of which the British Navy is composed to-day. I beThe idea dominating the lieve that we shall develop similar material when we provide our boys with similar opportunities.

155,Mr Roberts,"When the Minister sayshe wish honourable members to understand that his statements do not contain a declaration of Ministerial policy? My statements are a declaration of Ministerial policy. All that I have suggested is that upon matters requiring expert knowledge I have adopted the expert opinion of officers .of the Department. probable danger that we have to meet so far as our land forces are concerned? What forces have we at our disposal with which to meet it, and what is the condition of these forces at the present time? gard to the first question-the probable danger that we have to meetI find that there is a considerable amount of misconception. We are generally told that we shall probably be attacked by four unarmoured cruisers landing 1,000 soldiers in Australia. That is one view of the probable danger that we have to face, but it is not all of it. I propose, out of the mouths of Imperial experts, to make the House familiar-with another aspect of this question. We have to do very much more than provide for meeting a danger of that kind. connection I may be permitted to say that experts vary their views from time to timeindeed, defence seems almost to be the one indeterminate science. A military expert must vary his views as circumstances may require, and we must vary our means of defence as the circumstances of the world may necessitate. That is why we find experts to-day expressing an opinion on matters of defence which they shortly afterwards vary, and with very good reason. As an instance of this, I may quote the statement made by Major-General Hutton when he undertook to organize the defence of Australia in 1902. Upon that occasion he saidTt is on the one hand certain that the geographical position of Australia renders it iess liable to aggression from any foreign Power than most parts of the Empire. Only two years later the same distinguished soldier, in his annual report of 1904, saidThe principle in view in thus laying down the above minimum numbers for the Military Forces of the Commonwealth is that a hostile invasion of Australia, with intention to effect permanent territorial occupation, would never be attempted with a less force than from 20,000 to 50,000 well equipped, well trained, and well organized troops."" It is obvious, therefore, that a force at least equal to that proposed is required to insure anv reasonable hope of success. The security by' land of Australia as a whole cannot, moreover, be considered assured without a complete inter-communication between the States, and especially between those vulnerable points on the long coast line of Australia, for which land defence is provided. It is to be hoped, therefore, that as soon as the complete organization and equipment of the Military Forces of the Commonwealth are determined upon the direct communication by railway between Western Australia and the Eastern States may be carried into effect. It may be as well to state at once that a force of the requisite strength organized and capable of taking the field does not at present exist in Australia, and that there are at present What is the no local means of equipping such a force. The organization is incomplete; the Departments necessary for a mobile army have yet to be created; and there are neither sufficient guns, arms, equipment, nor ammunition available. It will therefore be seen that the construction of In rea Trans-Continental Railway would under existing circumstances confer no satisfactory advantage upon Australia in its present condition of military unpreparedness. The most that could be expected from the military situation at present existing would be the concentration of a certain number of armed men, who, without adequate Administrative Departments or the required equipment, would be quite incapable of coping with even an inferior number of an invaders troops, carefully trained, organized and equipped with the latest modern appliances, as they unquestionably would be. It is impossible to view the military situation in Australia, in face of the momentous changes taking place in the balance of power in the East without grave misgivings. In this a It will be seen, therefore, that as far back as 1904 this distinguished soldier saw the changes which were taking place in the Eastern aspect of the International situation, and recognised those changes as being of a very serious character. But I should like to quote an even higher authority upon this question, not as containing a direct statement as to what our theory of attack should be or anything of the kind, but as bearing on the general character of the preparations of Australia for her defence. As late as 1906 the Imperial Defence Committee, while approving of the general lines of the organization which had been laid down for the defence of Australia, went on to advise thatAt the same time it is necessary to extend opportunities of elementary military instruction in various forms to as large a proportion as possible of the population, with a view to rendering military training as universal as circumstances may for the time being permit. . . . In considering this subject it is necessary to draw a clear distinction between hasty raids, dependent for success on surprise and rapidity of execution rather than on the number of troops employed, and larger operations aiming at a prolonged or permanent occupation of Australian territory. . . . The influence of sea power may prolong the period available after the outbreak of a great war for the expansion and training of land forces, and may transfer the :! scene bf the decisive land battles to foreign soil, but it cannot by itself decide the issue of a war for national existence-",28,Suspension Of Standing
156,Mr Joseph Cook,"Certainly not.That is to say, we may not depend alone upon the navy in a war for national existencewhich must in the last resort depend on the action of f u l l y developed citizen forces. The main object of a field force organization of part of the Militia in Australia is to supply the basis for expansion in case of grave national emergency. These are weighty words, and they have not only been uttered for our benefit, but have been acted upon by Great Britain herself. Lately we have seen a complete reorganization of the army, both at Home and in India-a upon the advice which the Imperial Defence Committee gave us in the passage that I have just quoted. but Great Britain also that ordinated as far as is possible, that we should have the^ same standards of arms, ammunition, education, and equipment, and that there should be one Imperial General Staff shaping our war preparations upon a common basis, so that they may be at once available should the Empire as a whole be challenged. I have read to the House, I think that our paramount duty at the moment is to be adequately prepared, and to recognise all the contingencies consequent upon our being part of a world-wide Empire. aims at providing, as far as we may possibly do, for all those contingencies. emphasis upon the matter of preparation because "" adequate preparation is the one essential factor in securing rapid and successful decision."" tion from the report of the Imperial Defence Committee. tion,"" as honourable members will readily see, means long and careful effort in time of peace. of the army must necessarily occupy a great deal of time. a. deficiency of material. is only a matter of price.

That means that we must make our forces capable of immediate mobilization. It means also that we must have officers, non-commissioned officers, and equipment, continually at war strength-whic h is not the position to-day-and that we must be wanting only in men to complete the organization, whenever the need for mobilization arises. If we are to meet such a raid successfully we must have in our own reserves trained men to fill any units that may be ordered out. To reorganization proceeding obtain the best results, therefore, our troops must be trained on a war footing-whic h has not been done up to the present time Not only is this so, -and our reserves must be organized. is most anxious Every man must know what to do, and our forces should be cowhere to go in a time of national emergency. Then, again, behind these, there must be a general trained reserve to meet the immediate wastage of war which, I am told, amounts, in the first six months of a conflict, to about 80 per cent. In this general reserve I am hoping that we shall find in the future a sound and useful place for our In view of the statement that rifle clubsa place which, through no fault of their own, they do not and cannot fill adequately to-day. In a word, the Government, through this B ill , will aim at the creation of a national army, well balanced This Bill in all its parts, and complete, so far as human ingenuity can make it. It will I lay aim at an army that will have its infantry, artillery, light horse, engineers, signallers, telegraphists, army service corps, and army medical corps in their due and That again is a quotaproper proportions. All these again must have their ammunition columns, their trans""Adequate preparaport and supply columns, their field ambulances, and, in the near future, I think, their wireless telegraphy, their aerial The creation of the personnel navigators, and their telephonists. We must have, in short, all the appurWe may readily make good tenances necessary for the successful That, after all, conduct of war in these modern -days, and they must be welded into a mobile, flexible army, ready to move with precision and decision to the attack. We want a homogeneous organization in which every part shall fit into its appointed place, and Parliament will require to back that army, as I am sure it will, generously and fairly. The question Let it be arises, "" H a v e we such an army to-day ?"" I do not know that I need ask it, but the What then answer is that we have not. Indeed, we have nothing like it.

They have never had that advantage before. that the time is too short? no doubt will differ on this as on many other matters. I consider that I am doing what will be necessary for the development of an efficient citizen force for Australia, and the honourable member will find that I have a pretty decent war bill. I have already said that at the age of eighteen years these young men will pass into the adult force. For the first year, that is, until they are nineteen, they will form the second line, as I have indicated. There will be complete equipment on a war footing for all these at the camps of training, so far as technical vehicles and all things necessary for war equipment go. The only articles which we shall not have, and which will require to be mobilized in time of war, will be ordinary transport vehicles. In this respect we intend to follow a good example, which has been set in connection with tbe Territorial Forces at home. They have an advantage over us, however, because they have an expeditionary force equipped at war strength, ready to march instanter wherever it may be called, and that equipment is available for peace training Country. dinary transport to register the vehicles of the country which are necessary for the purpose. ments with private individuals, and, if necessary, to take power to impress into the service of the army private vehicles in time of war.

D o not all the experts say to transport generally, as far as organization is concerned. After these young men have been trained to their twentieth year, the way will be open for them to pass into the militia. We shall require about one-third of the militia strength to be recruited every year; that is our experience so far. There will, therefore, be 8,000 or 9,000 vacancies in the militia every year for these young men if they decide to enter it, and get the fuller pay which a militia man will receive. All my advisers tell me that, in their opinion, there will not be the slightest difficulty in filling up the militia ranks with twenty-year-old men. They tell me that the lads, after completing,their compulsory training, and doing part o? it for nothing, will be glad to receive the higher pay with the better conditions attached to the militia force. There will be abundant opportunities for promotion, I hope, with a scheme of this kind. For the second line alone we shall want 2,000 officers and sergeants from the militiamen. Opportunities will be open for young men in a direction which hitherto has not obtained. I venture to say that as the result of it all there will be a better spirit, a better training, a better equipment, and a better feeling throughout our forces than exist at present. Of course, every year in the Old the lads who do not go into the militia will But we propose for our orpass into the reserve, and will be called upon to register themselves. The difficulty with our voluntary system has been that we We propose to make arrangehave not been able to follow young men when they leave the militia service.

It is, therefore, made compulsory upon young men that between twenty and twenty-six years of age they shall register themselves once a rear at the place where they reside. them to do. In the meantime they will be organized in units as a reserve. If they leave one district and go to another, they must register, and attach themselves to the force there.

The honourable member for Corio has referred to the penalties provided for in the B ill . difficult matter to deal with, and I do not know yet that we have obtained the right solution of the problem. It is a matter upon which we must keep an open mind. Should the provisions imposing penalties be regarded as too drastic, the Government will be ready to review them; but at present we regard our proposals as fair. It is provided that if a boy does not do his training in the first year, he must do it in the second, in addition to the second year's training. second, it accumulates in the t h i r d ; and, finally in the fourth year, when, if it is not done, he is to be regarded as incorrigible, and put into a barracks, or some other place, where he can be compelled to do it under duress. Every man must train, and if he will not do so voluntarily, must be compelled to do so. such as were provided in Ihe previous Bill have been generally looked upon by honourable members as useless. We must compel our youths to go through the prescribed course of training, even, if to do so, we have to place them under arrest. with that difficulty as we meet it ; but the Government have no wish to do violence to their conscience or to their faith.. Registration will take place for the first time at the beginning of the year 1911, and training will commence in July, 1911, in the winter months.

The General Staff will be confined for the moment to Head-quarters. on we hope to be able to extend it to the provinces, and call in the services of some of our best officers in that way. It must continue to expand until, as has been said, we create an organism whose arteries shall spread through the whole army, doing all that is requisite for its advancement. Our aim is the standardization of our men, our arms, our system of education, and our equipment. In other words, it is to provide for complete interchangeability of the army as well as of the navy-interchange ability of every part of the Empire war machine, naval as well as military. That is the ultimate object which we have in view-. Provision for the establishment of a military college, and also for a school of musketry, has been made upon the Estimates.

The possession of the cash is necessary as well as the possession of brains. One is to a great extent useless without the other. Thus it comes about that every country in the world is increasing the cost of its army in order to increase the efficiency of that army. In Great Britain, the Territorial army costs about Â£10 ios. per head per annum ; whilst our present force costs Â£15 7s. 3d. Our total expenditure will increase largely, and our war bill must increase by more than 100 per cent, within the next few years. I anticipate that during the next three or four years our defence bill for naval and military purposes will be about Â£2,500,000 per annum. Even then, I submit, it will be a bill of modest dimensions compared with that of other countries of the world. It will represent about ios. 6d. per head annually, as against 27s. id. per head which is expended by Great Britain. and range of the interests to be protected must determine the extent and cost of our preparations, and viewed from that stand-point, our defence even then, will be very small indeed. trade to be protected, we should have to spend very much more than that. should have to expend Â£5,500,000 if we paid as much per head for defence as does France, Â£4,500,000 if we expended as much per head as does Germany, Â£7,500,000 if we contributed as much per head as does Japan, and ^Â£5,000,000 if we expended as much per head as does Great Britain and the United States. additional expenditure we shall get a navy that will fight well upon the sea and an army that will be fit to fight upon the land. That is the purpose of this Bill, and these are the propositions of the Government. We propose to perfect our present force and to build upon it, adding to its numbers and efficiency by steady and continuous accretions, remembering that it is the trained troops of the world whom we shall eventually have to meet in the great struggle which seems destined to come at some time or other.

It was thought that the matter should be left to the Federal Parliament itself. Sir William Zeal, who was a member of the Convention, felt so strongly on the subject, that he moved an amendment providing that no member of Parliament should, unless he had ceased to be a member for six months, be qualified to accept any office of profit, not even a Judgeship, under the Crown; and, from the records of the Convention, that amendment appears to have been carried by a majority of one.

I desire to emphasize the fact that the question was not whether members of Parliament should have the right to accept such appointments immediately on ceasing to be members, but whether a provision dealing with the matter should be made part of the Constitution. I presume that this amendment must have been negatived in some way, subsequently; because there is no section to' that effect in the Constitution. .history shows that some men of the highest ability would not have found their way to the Bench. point was raised in the course of the debate by Sir Edward Braddon, as shown by the following extract from the report:There might be a member of Parliament admirably suited to some post-mor e fitted for it, in fact, than anybody else available-and yet the Government of the"" day would be precluded from appointing that gentleman for six months, which might mean they would be precluded from making the appointment altogether. that mentioned by Sir Edward Braddon occurred, it would be competent fer the Government to introduce a measure dealing with it. 1 admit that a very strong case was made out by those who were opposing such a provision in the Constitution ; because, as The general trend of the disMr Isaacs pointed out, an Act of Parliament would not have been sufficient to achieve what Sir William Zeal anticipated.

If it is a source of danger to appoint members of Parliament to positions of profit under the Crown, is it not a hundredfold more dangerous to appoint a member of Parliament, he being an active, partisan, to the office of Chief Justice?

240,Mr Glynn,"In South Australia, an ActZeal pointed out is the Victorian law. torney-General has told us that there was a case of the kind in South Australia. Seeing that the Prime Minister voted for Sir William Zeal's proposal, I think it would be wise, now that he has the power, to provide that no member of Parliament shall accept the position of High Commissioner. are not members of Parliament fit for the position, because one of the three gentlemen, whose names have been mentioned is, if not the ablest, one of the ablest public men in Australia. The Other two gentlemen, however, would, I venture to say, never have been suggested had they not been members of Parliament. Under such a provision as I have mentioned, we might lose valuable services now and then; but, on the other hand, it must be admitted that, in the case of the Agents-General particularly, although some very able men have held the position, we have again, and again seen appointments made solely on political grounds. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.43 p.m. at the Convention in favour of the appointment being a non-political one, were the present Prime Minister and the honourable member for Bendigo. Many State Agents General have been appointed as the outcome of the needs of political parties, and I appointments have often turned out well. I do not mean to say that because a man is a member of Parliament it necessarily follows that the appointment would not be a good one. In many instances capable men were appointed, but we ought not to do a thing simoly because of happy accidents. We should rather lav down a general rule which would be for the benefit of the Commonwealth. opportunity was not given to us to discuss the matter on the second reading, so that the feeling of the House might have been tested in Committee by means of an amendment. The House will have no opportunity at this stage of showing by a vote whetlier it favours this proposal or not, but I trust that the other House will insert it in the B ill , so that when it comes back we may have an opportunity of discussing the question fullv , and of voting upon it . [7.49] I also regret that the ""gaggerites"" destroyed our opportunity to talk on the second reading of the B ill . I regard this as one of the most important measures ever brought before this House. I do not think my honourable friends on the Government side have taken it seriously enough, or grasped its wonderful purport. It provides for the appointment of a man who will have control, not merely of ,Â£250,000,000 of debts, but eventually, perhaps, of Â£500,000,000 or I do not mean to say that there Â£600,000,000 because if it has taken Â£250,000,000 of debts to place here a population of 4,300,000, it will take over Â£500,000,000 to put a population of 8,000,000 in Australia. That is a serious matter, which Australia ought to have it* ablest financial man to manage. I am sorry the Australian people do not look at the matter from a different stand-point, because there is no doubt that you can get so heavily into debt that it will eventually mean liquidation. There is no difference in that regard between a Government and an individual, for the Government is only a multiplied number of individuals. I recognise that in this country the less you know about doing anything the better qualified you are to be in Parliament. However, I urged the House some time ago to establish a building in London that would be'the centre of Australian trade and commerce. I wanted a structure, something like some of the American States have in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, to be a sort of rallying place for Australians. am prepared to admit that the I wanted, not a little building of two or three stories, but one of twelve or fifteen stories high, with the right honourable member for East Sydney installed in it, because when he was in London in the Jubilee year, he was, according to the American papers, one of the great attractions of the whole universe. When the Government proposed last year to purchase a building, they went to Trafalgar Square, away from the finanI regret that a fuller cial centre of London. Australia must be in the financial centre of London, and not in the theatrical part. We do not require to build where the theatres are. I know that the Prime Minister was not responsible for that proposal, but unfortunately in Australia public men talk about being guided by the experts. My experience has taught me that the expert is a man who knows nothing about anything. Only to-day I have heard that we are to spend Â£3,750,000 on an army and navy, or a navy alone.

Every one of the great millionaires of America started by buying a bank. Mr E. H .

Because he recognised that it is impossible to operate any great potential activity without having control over a banking institution..

Let us have no doubt about this matter. have failed to reach the pinnacle of financial fame, although they have struggled to rlo so, because they were unable to control a bank. become millionaires through' securing control of banking corporations, why should not Australia have a banking institution of her own, and so operate her great potential activities? to do with the question? great deal to do with the question. Here we have a country with a population of 4,300,000 and a debt of Â£270,000,000, including'thc debts of the municipalities, those for waterworks, and everything for which the States are responsible to English and Australian lenders. I maintain that of that Â£110,000,000 which has been borrowed by the Australian States, Â£75,000,000 has been a genuine ""fake""a "" f a k e "" that would make a blackfellow blush if he knew that his seven-year-old boy had carried out finance on the same basis. hold that Â£15,000,000 has been utilized to pay interest on the debts; Â£15,000,000 has been utilized to eke out revenue; Â£15,000,000 more has been utilized in buying back land after selling the assets of this great Commonwealth at a low price and treating the receipts as revenue. And this is called finance!

Honourable members opposite can gag me down if they like. The crowd cried out for Barrabas, and crucified our Saviour.. At certain seasons of the year millions of Australian money are sent to London by means of. time drafts and bills of exchange. This-' money is taken out of circulation in Australia, and is lent out upon call loans; be-cause it must always be ready to be sent back to the Australian banks when they want it. If we had our own institution in London instead of having our . stock operated by a bank that has no interest in us, we should inscribe our own stock in our own bank, and could sell it in denominations as low as Â£ 5 or Â£ r o to the public. In the past, when the Australian Hundreds of men in Australia States have floated loans at a lower rate of interest than their organized credit warranted, in nine cases out of ten they have had to suffer huge discounts, which If men in America, have really -became part of the permanent debt. ' Say that the unorganized credit of the States, was only sufficiently strong to float a loan at 3! per cent, at par. If a State floated at 3 per cent., it must take Â£ 9 3 cash for Â£100 worth of stock. That would mean that on a ,Â£2,000,000 liability, the State would receive only Â£1,860,000; and the .Â£140,000 discount would be added to the principal amount on which interest would have to be paid. Therefore, while the State would pay Â£ 3 4s. 66. on .Â£1,860,000 which it borrowed, it would pay the remaining 5s. 6d. on the Â£140,000 ; which would really mean that it was paying 34 per cent, for the loan. I thought, that the High Commissioner in London would operate a bank and would look after Australian loans. Having a deep interest in his own country, he would see that our financing was done to the best advantage. This House makes it a great boast that we I have here business men of experience, and I thought that they' would be willing to help me to put something in this Bill that would mean business. But, no.

I believe that it is in the highest degree important that we should have a High Commissioner in London who will speak in the name of Australia. But I do hope that as a consequence of the passing of the Bill, and of the appointment that will follow, we shall secure a corresponding decrease, in the amount expended by the individual States in London. There is not the slightest doubt that when we entered into Federation and assumed the responsibility of establishing nn additional Parliament most persons anticipated that therewould be a corresponding decrease in State expenditure; biit that anticipation has not been realized. Bill is simply to be passed in order to allow another appointment of a high character to be made and thereby increase the existing expenditure in London, the House ought to pause. Bill was the proper time for the Government to reveal the nature of the negotiations which were proceeding with the States in order to secure what, in my opinion, is 3 most desirable objective. Apart from the mere statement that such negotiations were proceeding, the Minister of External of the State expenditure in London. correspondence showed such an indication on the part of certain of the States. the flimsiest justification which we could have for sanctioning an appointment of this kind. If it involves the expenditure of Â£40,000 or Â£50,000 a year in addition to the present expenditure upon the representation of the States in London, the Bill ought not to pass. If it means that Australia will be able to speak through one mouthpiece instead of six mouthpieces, the Bill ought to pass. But if it means the establishment of an additional expensive institution in London, then iu the interests of Australia's financial prospects it ought not to be permitted.

Dealing with that arrangement it is due to the Government that I should say that I have no sympathy with those who allege that in entering into negotiations with the representatives of the States at the recent Premiers' Conference they lowered in any way the dignity I agree entirely wilh the Prime Minister that the State Premiers and the State and Commonwealth Parliaments are alike the servants of the people. It is desirable that both parties should recognise that it is their termine how those debts could be duty fo promote the interests of the country by every means in their power, and that they should co-operate with each other with that end in view. I consider that the Conference which has resulted in the agreement laid on the table of the House by the Prime Minister has borne most satisfactory fruit. I recognise that the Government have not pleased all sections of the House, or of the -public, by doing what has been done. But they have gained much. have gained that genuine feeling of cooperation, that spirit of accommodation between the State Premiers and the representatives of the Commonwealth, which, on former occasions, was so conspicuouslyabsent. question of motives. I am told that "" it is al! a political game.'' factory to find that the representatives of the States and of the Commonwealth have been able to arrive at certain definite conclusions. Much has been gained by reason of the fact that for the first time the representatives of the States have unanimously subscribed to proposals which the Prime Minister has recommended to this Parliament for acceptance. We thus know thc minimum amount which the State Premiers think it is necessary' that the Commonwealth should annually return to them from Customs and Excise revenue. These are great gains, and the proposals are such as will provide the basis, at least, of a satisfactory settlement of this intricate question. I do not say that we can accept those proposals in their entirety, but at least they provide us with a starting point from which we may be able to formulate an acceptable arrangement. It has been urged on many occasions that the method of settlement of thefinancialrelations of the Commonwealth to the States provided by the Constitution is unsatisfactory. Every one must admit that. But the reason of this is plain. When the Constitution was framed, there was an absence of data on which to base any scheme which would be satisfactory of this Parliament. alike to the States and the Commonwealth. The indebtedness of the various States, in proportions fer capita which differed so widely one from the other, rendered it almost impossible to deconsolidated without unfair conditions being imposed upon some States as -against others. With all the wisdom commanded by our representatives at the Federal Convention, it was impossible for them to formulate a. satisfactory scheme for all time, and one which would meet the varying conditions of the States. That fact is recognised in the agreement which has been submitted by the Prime Minister. Its preamble statesFor the first time they That the financial relations of the Federal and State Governments, which under thc Constitution were determined only in part,and for a term of years, should he placed upon a sound and permanent basis. That is an admission that the financial relations of the Commonwealth and States had been determined only in part, and were still open to consideration. The first clause of the agreement is an acknowledgment that it is the intention of the Constitution to provide for the consolidation and transfer of the State debts. This is an admission which is of infinite value, because it has now been placed upon record by all the parties to the proposed agreement that the intention of the Constitution is that the State debts shall be assumed by tlie Commonwealth, and shall thereafter be managed by the Commonwealth on behalf of the States. I have already remarked that the difficulty which confronted the framers of the Constitution was due to the uncertainty which then existed, and that as a result the financial provisions of the Constitution were incomplete, and, in some respects, unsatisfactory. It seems tome that the duty now devolves upon this House of completing the work which was begun by the framers of our Constitution, but which, owing to the circumstances,they were unable satisfactorily to complete. The question of determining the future financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth is not one which should-be-",47,Deakin

Unless it is so treated, there is grave danger that unsatisfactory results may ensue. I have heard it stated that the Braddon section of the Constitution imposes upon the Commonwealth the duty of recognising for all time the claim of the States to participate in the revenue collected from Customs and Excise. Let us for a moment review the history of thc nnancial provisions of the Constitution, and especially of the Braddon section. In 1891, the first Federal Convention was held, at which a Constitution Bill was drafted, mainly, I believe, by Sir Samuel Griffith and some of his colleagues on the High Court Bench. Sir Samuel Griffith then pointed out thatThe great difficulty Customs revenue of the Colonies in all cases forms a very large share of the means of meeting the expenses of the Government, and as we should take over only a very small part of the expenditure, the Commonwealth would start with 'an enormous annual surplus of many millions which it could not retain or expend, but must return to the different Slates. on the Finance Committee of the Convention, saidThe Convention recognised that the Federal Parliament, ivith experience of the working of the Federal Tariff, would have a solid foundation to build upon which was lacking to the Convention. Speaking at the Adelaide Convention in 1897, Sir William McMillan also said that he believed the only way to settle the problem of distribution was to leave it to the Federal -Parliament as "" the great negotiator."" The right honourable member for East Sydney saidl i e objected to fixing any minimum return or lo loading the Commonwealth with the debts. New South Wales was prepared, with the odds against her, to trust the fiscal question to the Federal Parliament, but she was not prepared to give to. thc Commonwealth burdens which would compel a high Tariff. During the sittings of the Convention at Adelaide, and elsewhere, there was always manifested a feeling that so long as the States were responsible for the interest on their debts, and that interest formed a part of their expenditure, they must necessarily obtain from the Commonwealth Government a large amount. That was the dominating idea, and the remarks which I have quoted were made on the assumption that the debts were still to be retained by the States, and that they would have to find the interest payable upon them, as they had done prior to Federation. At the Adelaide sittings of the Convention, our late Speaker proposed the adoption of a sliding scale. He urged that a per capita distribution of revenue and expenditure was the fairest and the most federal system to adopt; and that it was necessary to protect the States as long as they had obligations in connection with their debts, l n proposing a sliding scale and the adoption of the per capita system, however, he never for a moment attempted to limit the expenditure of the Commonwealth. He left the question perfectly open. It was not until the last day of the sittings of the Convention in 1898 that the matter was finally disposed of. The old difficulty then presented itself once more. Jealousy is that the between the States, as well as on rhe part of Free Traders, on the one hand, and of Protectionists on the other, caused a feeling of uncertainty, and, above all, of distrust of the Commonwealth, to prevail, with the result lhat Sir Edward Braddon moved his famous clause. The clause as originally proposed provided that out of the net Customs and Excise revenue not more than one-twentieth should be spent by the Commonwealth in the exercise of its original powers; and not more than fourtwentieths on the transferred services, the remaining three-fourtht to be distributed among the States. That astounding proposition was carried hy 21 votes io 18, and later Sir Edward Braddon consented to simplify the clause by omitting the provision distinguishing between the different kinds of expenditure, and enacting that the Commonwealth should receive one-fourth of its net Customs and Excise revenue to provide for all its services. That is the history of the Braddon section. It was on the face of it a most crude and incomplete arrangement. It could not work satisfactorily, since it placed the Commonwealth in the position of having to impose taxation to the extent of Â£ 4 0 0 to secure for itself revenue to the amount of Â£ 1 0 0 , and to give to the States the remaining Â£ 3 0 0 , which possibly they did not require. It has been alleged, both in the press and in other quarters, that the Braddon clause was passed by the people, and that it was subsequently amended, so that its continuance was limited to a period of not more than ten years, by a Conference of Premiers who had no authority to make",48,Deakin

The but the facts are that after the clause had first clause of the agreement contains the' been passed by the Convention it was put followingto the people at the first referendum, and was adopted: It was not adopted by New South Wales. majority, but not by the required majority, of the people of New South Wales. the people of Queensland; it was not submitted to them. jected are right, and so am I . It is true, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, that the question was not submitted to the people of Queensland at the first referendum, because that State was not a party to the Convention. It was adopted by the people of New South Wales, but by an insufficient majority. After the poll in that State, however, the right honourable member for East Sydneyproposed that the Braddon clause should be deleted from the Constitution Bill. convened a Conference of Premiers at Melbourne, and there the question was discussed, with the result that the Conference agreed to allow the clause as it stood to remain, but with the proviso that it should have a. currency of not more than ten years. With the clause as so amended the Bill was again submitted to a referendum of the people, and was unquestionably accepted. The fact that the Braddon section, limited in its duration to ten years, is in the Constitution by the will of the people, and that it has been left to us to complete the work which the Convention, because of the want of data, was unable to satisfactorily carry out, sliould induce us to approach this subject as I believe the members of the Conference approached it, with a desire to make an arrangement which will be just and acceptable to the States on the one hand, and to the Commonwealth on the other. this arrangement enable us to go in that direction? I listened with interest, as I think most honourable members did, to the Prime Minister's opening address. honourable gentleman struck the true note when he said that the Commonwealth and the States have only one interest in common, That is a widely enterand that is the interest of Australia ; and, so far as I can see, that interest has been conserved up to a certain point, by the A prominent arrangement which has been come to.' Thc That to f u l f i l the intention of the Constitution by providing for the consolidation and transfer uf State debts, and in order to insure the most profitable management of future loans by the establishment of one Australian Stock a complete investigation of this most important subject shall be undertaken forthwith by the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States. This investigation shall include the question of the actual cost to the States of transferred properties as defrayed out of loan or revenue moneys. That, it seems to me, is not consistent with the introductory clause. It deals with the part of the Constitution that is imperfect but does not propose to remove tbe imperfection, and only proposes that' it be referred for further investigation by the Governments of thc Commonwealth and the States. ' The imperfect part is that dealing with thc transfer of the debts, because there is no adequate provision made to that end. The next clause deals with another subjectThat in order to give freedom to the CommonHe wealth in levying duties of Customs and Excise, and to assure to thc States a certain annual income, the Commonwealth shall, after the first day of July, One thousand sine hundred and ten, pay monthly to the States a sum calculated it the' rate of One pound five shillings per annum per head of population according to the latest statistics of the Commonwealth. That is a portion of the Constitution ' which, I hold, is, under the Braddon section, settled. After 1910 this Parliament, as representing the Commonwealth, has a perfect right and freedom to levy duties as it may see fit, and to assure the States r.n annual income without any alteration of the Constitution. It seems to me that tlie agreement in one respect goes too far, while in another respect it does not go far enough; and the question I put to myself is, "" Now that the Parliament has. this matter in its hands, what can it do to perfect the proposal, and make it attain the object, which, I How far cloes am sure, we all have in view, namely, a satisfactory and permanent settlement of this knotty question?"" I may be permitted to refer in this connection to the The propositions which I had thc honour to make in this House in1906. I then proposed a scheme which, on the face of it, seemed complicated, but which, under-",49,Deakin

306,Mr Harper,"Thos e who have interstood as I believe a number of honourable members now understand it, is simplicity itself. trespass on the patience of honourable members by going into tbe details of the proposed scheme; but I shall remind the House of a few points, and show what it proposed to do, and what it would have done had it been adopted. So far as my observation goes, the scheme has stood the test of criticism for three years; but, unfortunately, it apparently did not commend itself for some reason or other to most of the Premiers of the States. may say, however, that immediately after the delivery of m y speech I received an approving letter from Mr Kidston; and, a few weeks later, he also sent me a report of his Budget speech. referring to my proposals, Mr Kidston said :He hns proposed certain provisions which make his scheme worthy of careful 'consideration, both by the State and Federal Parliaments. After describing the scheme pretty f u l l y, he went on to say :There-* aie many other matters involved in such a settlement of the financial problems of the Federation, wbich need not be discussed now, but whatever difficulties Mr Harper's scheme may present, it has at least this to recommend it-it would end the feeling of insecurity which now prevails,and restore financial stability to the States. Even the great disparity which now exists between the fer cafiia indebtedness of the various States, would largely disappear during the twenty-five years of the operation of this scheme. Mr Kidston and others expressed approval j but my ictea was not adopted. Wbat would that scheme have done? It would have secured a fair settlement of the obligations of the States to the Commonwealth, and of the Commonwealth to the States, by doing what? for a. starting point a return to the States of Â£ 6 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 annually, as three-fourths of the Customs ancl Excise revenue based on four years' average returns. difference between the amount, which had which Commonwealth, and the interest on the debts, which the States themselves were paying, was Â£ 1 , 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 . in 1906; and up to 1910 the States had to make that interest good. After 1910, and for twenty years, the amount of the difference was to be diminished annually by the cumulative rate of 5 per cent, per annum, so that in 1911 the States would pay Â£ 9 0 , 0 0 0 less, in the next year Â£ 1 8 0 , 0 0 0 less, and so on, until at the end of the twenty years the Commonwealth would I am not going to waste time or have assumed the responsibility for the payment of the whole of the interest on the debts, the States would have possession of their railways and other public works represented by their debts, and the Commonwealth would have practically endowed the States for all time with Â£230,000,000 , the annual value of which, at the rate of interest they were paying their creditors, was : Â£8,500,000. That is to say, the payment 'by the States for twenty years of the inI terest they would have had to pay to their creditors for all time if there had been no Federation, would leave them free from any further charge, and in possession of their railways and public works. In that speech, Could there be anything more liberal or fair? The point, which seems to have bulked so largely from time to time in the minds of many of the representatives of the States-that they were entitled, owing to increased population, to a larger share than, the sum I have fixed to start withI had conceded because the rebate annually of 5 per cent, cumulative was just about the amount that would he contributed by three-fourths of Customs and Excise by the anticipated additional population based on the experience of the average of the last thirty years. So that practically at the end of the time they would have had the financial benefits of the Braddon section for twenty years, .although it would have been repealed. They would have had their properties For nothing, the debts would have been assumed by the Commonwealth, and no friction whatever would have been caused with regard to the States' income or expenditure. Honourable members will see that it makes no difference to the States whether they get It assumed Â£ 6 , 5 0 0 , 0 00 or Â£ 5 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , as is now proposed to be paid to them under the new arrangement, and pay the difference out of their resources to their creditors, or whether The the Commonwealth retains the 'Â£6,500,000 or Â£ 5 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , assumes the debts, and obbeen payable to the States, but tains from the States a sufficient sum annuwould be retained by the ally to make up the difference. It is a mere matter of accounts. This proposal to take over the debts, which is spoken of everyWe were then where as a matter of enormous difficulty and importance, is simply a transfer of bookkeepinga transfer from one account to another. That is to say, the Commonwealth would assume the obligation to meet the interest on the debts, on the other hand it would retain whatever proportion was to be paid to the States, and that improper motives in any action that they amount would go towards the payment of have taken. the interest. make up the balance for a given time.

314,Mr Harper,"It is the figure given bywas a boom year, so far as the Commonwealth revenue was concerned. It was the biggest year we had. amount received was much above the average. It was so large as to be almost equal to the amount of interest paid. But, taking the revenue amount of Â£8,884,596, and putting on the other side the interest on State debts, Â£9,634,026, that makes the balance ' Â£749,430, whicli the States supplied from their own revenues. the same in. both cases. The reason is, of course plain : that the States, ever since the Commonwealth has l;een establishedand I suppose before that time-hav e been mixing up their money, just as many people do; and those who do so generally get into a fog. The money which they have been receiving from public works, such as railways, has been mixed up in their general revenue; and the amount received from the Commonwealth ha? been mixed up in the same way. Out of the total, they paid so much to their creditors ' for interest. But, as a matter of fact, if they had reduced the matter to simple -elements, that they could have said to the Commonwealth, "" You owe us Â£8,844,596, and we owe our creditors Â£9,634,026; we will send you a cheque for Â£749,430, and you will pay the creditors."" That is what might easily have been done. All through these years, the States, so far as concerns their ordinary expenditure for education, police, law, and all internal administration which they were carrying on, have no: been benefited one penny by what they got from the Commonwealth, because it all went to pay their creditors, and generally out of their other resources something additional had to be paid in the same direction. sales. that was so. I think honourable members can see tiiat our task should be comparatively easy. I do not think there is any doubt, if one reads the history of the negotiations, as to what the intentions of the Convention and the people were-that in granting to this Parliament the absolute, supreme, and exclusive control of taxation by means of Customs and Excise, the obligation was implied that we should see that the needs of the States were properly attended to, and that their obligations were fairly met. about that, I .say that it is our duty on the one hand to see that the obligations Of course, the of the States are fairly met, and that it is their duty to make no demands that they ought not to make upon the Commonwealth. Therefore, I have no ""difficulty in saying that, so far as the arrangement made by the Government-is concerned, I am perfectly prepared to support fhe second reading of the B ill ; but I shall propose certain alterations which will carry But the net balance . is out the principles, and bring about the results, which I sought to attain by the scheme submitted hy me in 1906-that is to say, that the States shall be relieved of every shilling that they are entitled to be relieved of ; that the Commonwealth shall assume the entire obligation for the debts of the States, and that at the end of a certain period, the States will be in possession of an endowment, not of Â£233,000,000 , but of Â£249,000,600; and, therefore of a permanent annuitv of something like Â£9,000,000. That can. be done by the very simple expedient of accepting the 25s. per capita as an obligation upon this Commonwealth until such they would . have found time as the number of people of the Commonwealth wiil, at 25s. per head, return Â£9,000,000, which is about the amount of interest payable. that obligation in the Constitution. could be carried out without amending the Constitution; though I am prepared to amend it, and I think the argument of my honourable friend the Prime Minister is right, that if we are going into an arrangement of this sort, we are entitled to satisfy all parties ot our bona fides, and to make sure that this question shall not come up again if we can avoid it. Unfortunately, we have not the Bill before us; and I do not know exactly what its form will be. But this That being the position, is my first suggestion : We should, I think, grant to the States 25s. per head from the ist July, 1910, and until such 1 time as tbe population of the Commonwealth amounts to 7,200,000. another way. cause the time is uncertain. tion.

323,Mr King O'malley,"I would soonersection about it. The proposal has this effect: that it winds up the business, because it provides the money, at 25s. per capita, to meet the obligation which the Commonwealth would then have assumed. the honourable member do in regard to the debts of the States accumulating in the meantime ? that question just now. One problem at .'1 time is quite enough. I may deal with the question of future borrowing later on. 1 am dealing with this matter as a concrete entity. There is a certain amount of indebtedness existing at the present moment for which tbe States are liable, and on account of which they have to pay, in round figures, Â£9,000,006 annually, in the shape of interest. My problem is to meet their position by taking over that debt, the Commonwealth assuming the debt and giving to the States all the public works and all the other amenities that they have obtained from the use of the borrowed money; because Â£170,000,000 of the debt is represented by railways, and the rest is represented by a variety of other works. We give all these assets to' the States, and assume the whole of their debts, and we saj to them, ""We will allow you 25s. per head of what we collect as revenue, and we \yill allow you that amount until such time as the population of Australia is sufficient to yield the amount necessary to pay the interest on your debts."" Then we would cease to make any further contribution, because the Commonwealth would stand in the position in which the States are now. It would have the debts and they would have the assets worth Â£250,000,000. with an endowment of Â£250,000,000, which is of the annual value of Â£9,000,000, they must have very extraordinary ideas indeed if they think that they have a right to demand anything more. I would be content to leave the matter to posterity, but if this Parliament, in its wisdom, either now or later, says that at the end of the time it will give the States so much a head of their population it can do so. My own opinion is that the States are not entitled to make the request, but there may be some reason, of which I am not aware, why some consideration should be shown to them beyond the marvellous proposal to give them practically an endowment of Â£250,000,000, and a permanent annuity of Â£[9,000,000. The Commonwealth will have the debts,, and they will be left with all the properties. If that is not a sufficient endowment,. I do not know what is. I may refer here to the very different treatment meted out by would the Dominion of Canada to its Provinces. In that country they have a very smalt debt because they have no railways. a big railway. position as it exists. At present they have private railways, the capital of which is about Â£300,000,000. The debt of Canada is less than Â£100,000,000. A little while ago the honourable member for Darwin referred to the position of Canada and the United States, and talked about the States of the Commonwealth owing Â£250,000,000. Reckoning our debts in the same way as Canada's, we only owe Â£80,000,000 whereas Canada owes Â£90,000,000, and the capital of our Government railways amounts to ,Â£170,000,000. enormous canal system. ing anything which is extraneous to my subject. I am dealing with the question of railways. We have no canals, but we have railways, and I am .comparing railways with railways. When the four Provinces united in 1867 the Dominion took, over all the debts amounting to something under Â£20,000,000, and acquired the exclusive right to levy Customs anS Excise duties. So far it has not imposed any taxation other than Customs and Excise duties. What arrangement did it make with the Provinces ? It gave the Provinces If the States are started 80 cents, that is, 3s. 4d. per head of the population. That is all that it has paid.

340,Mr Harper,"Unde r the Constituwealth in the form of Customs and Excise revenue, all of which, and more, has gone to their creditors. If that we should provide for future debts, let him make a proposal for the payment to the States after the population of the Commonwealth reaches 7,200,000 of so much a. head, such as was made in the Canadian scheme. I , however, prefer to leave that to those who come after us. Wisdom will not die with us. Those who will govern the country thirty years hence will, I trust, be as fair-minded and as reasonable as we are, and will have a knowledge of the then existing facts. We cannot read the future, or foretell what changes may arise twenty or thirty years hence. We do not know what is in front of us. We do not know what will have to be spent on naval and military defence, or on old-age pensions, which this year will cost about Â£ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0; and, according to Mr Knibbs' calculation, will cost vastly more should the population increase to the number I have mentioned. The Commonwealth will have to provide for these pensions, and at the same time return 25s. per capita to the States. I am content with that, because the State and Commonwealth Governments are servants of the one people. There is a debt which involves an outlay in interest of Â£9,000,000 a year. It will make no difference to the people whether it is paid by the Commonwealth or by the State Governments, but in the practical working out of our financial affairs it is all important and absolutely necessary that the Commonwealth should take over the debts and be responsible for the payment of the interest on them. In doing that we should be giving the States for all time a permanent endowment of Â£250,000,000, and they would have no cause of complaint. point as to the time when the per capita allowance of 25s. per head shall cease, the Treasurer, at page 6 of his paper, dealing with the Conference, sets out an estimate made by the Treasury Department. Starting with an estimated population in 1910-11 of 4,435,000, andinio2o-i ' of 5,238,000, that allows, as the honourable gentleman explained, fer an advance of about 2 per cent, per annum. I consider that a low rate of advance. For some time we made an advance in population of only 1.50 per cent., but in the eighties, up to 1890, our advance was as high as 3.80 per cent, per annum. might easily again become as high as 3 per cent. I have carried on the right honourable gentleman's calculation on tlie basis my honourable friend thinks of a 2 per cent, advance, and I ' find that in 1930-31 our population would be 6,186,000, and in 1940-1, it would be 7,300,000. It would, therefore, on that estimate, be thirty years before this change would take place. That is to say, the States would have 25s. per capita assured to them until 1940. I have also worked out the calculation on the basis of an advance of 3 per cent. I should say that immigration almost ceased for a time, and from 1868 up till last year Ihe balance of immigrants over emigrants for all the States was only 750,000. That is the net increase due to immigration that we had in forty years. We had in the same period a natural increase of population of 2,200,000. We are looking forward to an increase in our population from immigration, and I think that an advance at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum might easily be accomplished. Should that be the case the desired time will arrive in 1930-1. We shall in twenty years, on the basis of a 3 per cent, advance in population have a population of 7,624,000; or, in thirty, years, if our advance were only 2 per cent., 7,300,000 as estimated by the Treasurer. That is what we must look forward to. Now, with regard to the future debts, I think honourable members will agree that it is axiomatic that if the Commonwealth takes over the debts of the States it must take over all their debts. Having done so it must be self-evident that we cannot allow the States to go on borrowing independently as they have done in the past. Mr W. H . IRVINE -They would not go free; they would bear the same burden as before. tinue to borrow as they chose without any restriction, they would not only increase their indebtedness, and of course, thereby diminish the Commonwealth security, but they would also enter into the money market against the Commonwealth Government, who would have to renew all their old debts. It. is a self-evident proposition that if we take over the debts of the Statesi-and they admit in this document that that is the intention expressed in the Constitution-w e must have some arrangement as to future borrowing, We cannot, in dealing with the Governments of these It sovereign States, say "" You are not to bor-",56,Dkdte R Etainet> The Thnee Poubths Beloscino To The States And Paid The Interest To Creoitobs Revenue
341,Referring To The Mr Harper,"T f they were to conTOW."" It would be madness to suppose such a thing. The States are only beginning their development, and State Governments must borrow. That is one consideration which makes me all the more anxious that we should arrive at some sound system of finance. Seeing that, I believe for good and not for evil, in Australia, we have decided that all such means of communication as railways shall be constructed by and continued under the control of the States, if the State Governever period was necessary on that basis to ments were to go on as in the past, borrowing and never paying off any debt, a time would arrive when they would no -longer be able to borrow or would have accumulated a greater indebtedness per head of population than almost any other nation in the world. of England is .Â£1,500,000,000. but that is not a debt debited to the State. the annuities would be based 011 such a If in Canada the railway indebtedness were added to the indebtedness of the State, the people of the Dominion would be a very much more heavily indebted community than are the people of Australia. I ara dealing now with what we have to look forward to. My proposal was, that in future there should be an arrangement made by the constitution, of a body absolutely independent of this and of the State Parliaments,as independent of either as is the High Court, and with a similar tenure of office. The members of this body might be called Debt Commissioners or Finance Commissioners ; the name is immaterial. Such a body should be constituted of capable reliable experts, who should have imposed on them not only the duty of renewing.all these State loans as they fall due and arrange for the payment of interest, but also offindingthe ""money requiredby the State Governments for reproductive purposes in future. They should have no right to refuse money to a State Govei'nment. ment, in making application for a loan, should make themselves responsible for the payment of interest to the Debt Commissioners, and for the establishment of a sinking fund, say, of one-half per cent., so that in time the new debts would be automatically paid off. Under my scheme I would make any new debts which the State Governments incur repayable to the Commonwealth by terminating annuities over a period of years. The money would be. borrowed for the State Governments by the Commonwealth Commission at cost, and they would have all the advantages of the market, Tf, for instance), it were proposed to float a 3 per cent, loan for Victoria at Â£ 9 6 , which would be Â£ 4 short of par, the Debt Commissioners would borrow the money, and would get repayments of interest at 3 per cent, on each Â£ 1 0 0 from the State Governments, plus one-half per cent, towards a sinking fund, which repayments would run over sixty or seventy years, or whatwork off the loan. on the investment. monwealth interest would be fixed at 3 per cent. If the money were borrowed for the construction of a railway the State Government might say that the railway, as part of its working expenses, should be responsible for 3} per cent, per annum, and payment and run over sixty or seventy years, or whatever the exact period might be according to an actuarial calculation. These remarks apply to debts incurred in future. As to the redemption of the existing debts taken over by the Commonwealth, these would, I anticipate, be provided for in time by a saving of, say, Â£ per cent., which I anticipate we should be able to make if we took over the State debts. Money is now costing the States on the average 3.6 per cent-, so that if we borrowed at par at 3 per cent'., we should be able to establish a sinking fund for the extinction of the existing debts from the difference. The States would provide thc Commonwealth with a sinking fund for the liquidation of their future debts, and with savings in interest on past debts, it might be that in years to come we would have Â£500,000,000 worth of public works, without any material addition to the debt at present existing. A State Governmember think that the saving of J per cent, is rather too much to expect? increasing population that we anticipate, our public works ought lo become immensely remunerative.

348,Mr Fishes,"Would the honorablewhen the Federal Convention met, and which was a disturbing element when the financial arrangement embodied in the Constitution was arrived at, that we could convert the State debts by one huge operation, is an absolutely impracticable one. We must wait until they fall due. The Treasurer, while in London, found-and the Agent-General for New South Wales also wrote a paper to the same effect-that after the Commonwealth stock had been fairly established, we ought to be able to procure money at par for 3 per cent. If we succeeded in doing that, we should effect a saving as compared with the rate which is now being paid by the States of .6 per cent. If the money thus saved were re-invested, it would-in sixty-four ox sixty-five yearsbe sufficient to wipe out the whole of our indebtedness of Â£^240,000,000. statement the other evening, honourable members opposite ridiculed it. saving which can be effected represents f, per cent. were re-invested, it would take about 100 years to liquidate our indebtedness. contingencies. Of course, any saving effected by the Commonwealth would represent an advantage. During the next twentyyears, loans aggregating Â£^148,000,000 will have to' be renewed, and the States may, if they retain the responsibility of their debts, not be able to reborrow upon such good terms as they borrowed originally. In other words, they may not be able to renew their loans even at the present rates, and the rate of interest, tion of liberality to the States as they could instead of averaging 3.6 per cent., may go up to 4 per cent. Buti f the Commonwealth creates a body which will have this Parliament behind it, and arranges for the conversion of the debts as they fall due, it will be able to effect that conversion on the best possible terms. It will have no competitors from Australia in the money-market, whereas for manv years there have been six competitors from this country. The Commissioners will have the money in hand, and will be able to say to our bondholders, "" You have been receiving interest at the rate of 4 per cent., but we can now borrow at 3 per cent. We will issue Commonwealth stock to you at 3 per cent, with, ['3']perhaps, a half-year's interest in addition; but if you do not choose to accept it in lieu of your present bonds, we will pay you off."" Under such circumstances, the probability is that the bondholders would accept the Commonwealth stock. The arrangement would be a purely business one; and it is the duty of the Commonwealth to adopt some such plan. Of course, the Parliament would have no veto over any new debts contracted by the States in conformity with such an arrangement. The Commissioners would have laid upon them the statutory duty of finding loan moneys for the States, consistently, of course, with the condition of the money market at the time. But an independent body, such as I have outlined, would have no feeling in this matter. They would have to find the money for the States, which, in turn, would have to guarantee interest upon the moneys so raised. Tn formulating this scheme, I recognised just one other difficulty. I foresaw the possibility of one State considering _ that the Commissioners were disadvantaging it for the purpose of advantaging another State. Accordingly, I provided for the creation of a very high tribunal, whose duty it would be to arbitrate in such cases. Briefly, the substance of my scheme is that the Commonwealth should take over all the State debts, and that, concurrently with that operation, it should make a per capita grant to the States. I think that by so doing the Commonwealth would be behaving very liberally to them. I do not think that in the near future the States' share of the Customs and Excise revenue will exceed Â£""6,500,000. But it must be recollected that during the current year, old-age pensions will absorb ;Â£i,500,600. It will thus be seen that the Prime Minister and his colleagues have gone as far in the direcsafely go. too far. are practically completing the work of the Federal Convention, which, necessarily, had to leave it incomplete. The honourable member for Gwydir has interjected that the Prime Minister has agreed to give the States too much. In the circumstances. I do not think that he has, provided that the agreement terminates when the Commonwealth is receiving from Customs and Excise only a sufficient sum to meet the whole interest upon the State debts.",58,Dkdte R Etainet> The Thnee Poubths Beloscino To The States And Paid The Interest To Creoitobs Revenue

It would secure to the States a -per capita payment of 25s. per annum for twenty, or it may be thirty years, or, in other words, as long as they had any obligation to meet in the shape of interest on their existing debts. I propose that the Commonwealth shall say to the States, "" We will take over your debts and pay tbe interest. We have agreed to give you annually Â£""5,500,000. We will put that against the amount to be paid as interest and you will make good the balance. When that has been done for twenty, or it may be thirty years, you will have been freed of the whole of your existing debts, and you will not have paid more than you are paying your creditors now by way of interest."" all their assets left to them. I think the representatives of the States have failed to realize. Commonwealth, by reason of its superior financial powers will be able, without adding one penny to the existing burdens of the people, to pay off the whole of the transferred debts in time.

The States would retain their railways and other assets resulting from their expenditure of loan moneys, and by paying interest for a certain number of years on the transdebts, and we have in the agreement before ferred debts-interes t which they would pay for all time unless they were relieved in the way I propose-the whole of their existing liability would be paid off, because corollary to that surely is that we cannot we should be able to effect savings which they could not possibly make. It seems to me to 'be as simple as the rule of three, and I fail to see why the States, if they are prepared to allow their debts to be transferred to the Commonwealth, should raise any objection to some regulation and control of future borrowing on their part.

[131]-2 . I am going to vote for the second reading of the Bill, because I believe the arrangement made to be a good one, as far as it goes, though it does not cover the whole case. Does any one say that my liberty of judgment, as a representative of the people, is to be impaired because a certain arrangement has been come to between certain gentlemen outside? Some of those gentlemen are influential and potential; and I commend the Prime' Minister for his eminent wisdom and tact in working with them; but surely this Parliament is the place in which to decide the question so long as it I have never been able to is within our power to do so. The second reading ought to be carried for the reasons I have stated j but I shall hold myself perfectly free in Committee to deal with the matter in such a way as to make the arrangement fair and more acceptable to the people of the country.

I accept this arrangement for twenty or thirty years; and I think that the Premiers would be very foolish men not to accept it. None of the present Premiers will be alive thirty years hence-though , perhaps, that is not a reason why they should sacrifice the interests of posterity, as they see them, or why we should do so in effecting and satisfactory, may become an awful bone of contention.

Curiously enough stimulants and narcotics are the most stable items in the Tariff; our income frem other items fluctuates in the most remarkable way, but I find that, for five years, the revenue from whisky, tobacco, and so forth, ranged from 22s. to 23s. per head. members ought to realize what that means, If the arrangement is an indefinite one, it ineans that, so long as the duties on stimulants and narcotics are maintained, and the habits of the people remain the same, there will be a mortgage of that revenue to the States. The other part of the Tariff is, as I have said, variable and uncertain, and could be supplemented in any way this Government think fit. There was one passage in the Prime Minister's speech with which I am afraid I am not sufficiently optimistic to agree. The honourable gentleman said that, if the proposed arrangement were made part of the Constitution, the latter could be altered clearly understa'id the position. The Goby the same power that had entered into the agreement. I do not think, however, that the Prime Minister, when he fully considers the matter, will maintain that an alteration would be easy under such cirnearer settlement, and my proposals deal cumstances. It might be felt that the arrangement imposed a great strain cn the Commonwealth, and that a reduction of the payment to the States was desirable; but we must not forget that immense interests might have been created. The expenditure of the States would doubtless be built on the subvention; and we all know how hard it is even for an individual who has been in receipt of ^Â£500 a year to adapt himself to a reduced income of Â£""300. Will the Prime Minister say that, under such circumstances, the necessary majority of the people in the necessary majority of the States could be obtained to alter the Constitution? Would it not be maintained by those interested, and who, perhaps, were less Australian than provincial, that there was a breach of faith? I feel confident that that wculd be the result; and, therefore, I think it would be the much easier way to adopt my suggestion-to let the States have the payment on their own terms of 25s. fer cafita, with the proposed limitation. Mr Harfer. be time for all parties to adjust themselves to the conditions. The States would This never have got into extravagant habits, because, as I pointed out, up till now, and always during the arrangement, they would practically be reaping no benefit from the fer cafita allowance so far as their ordinary expenditure is concerned. If , at the end of the time, they got the 25s. fer cafita, with no deduction, the natural result would be extravagance, and, in addition, those who imposed the taxes would have no power, over them. Honourable Thus we should have the extraordinary result of one body imposing taxes, and another body spending the money so raised. Looking at the matter from every standpoint, I say, "" L e t us act as wise men."" It would be a matter of much regret to me if this House considered that I was embarrassing the Government in any way. was quite right when he said that this should not be regarded as a party question. tion, and I do not treat it as such. Let us vernment had to accept the invitation to the Premiers' Conference. They were wise; and have done good work. They have brought the question perceptibly with their arrangement and say "" Yes, we accept that arrangement, with the further proviso that, instead of treating the' taking over of the debts as a matter for further inquiry, we complete the transaction in one act."" I think I have shown good reasons for saying that there is no need for further inquiry, once the amount which we have to pay to the States has been -fixed. Let us, therefore, complete the transaction and put it all before the people by submitting new sections to supersede the old financial sections of the Constitution. In that way we shall complete this business and have done with it for all time. might deal with the point that it is most difficult to alter the ' Constitution, because three of the lesser States might have only one-fourth of the population, and yet might prevent the majority from securing an alteration.

Let honourable members not oppose the arrangement, either as proposed or as suggested to be amended, simply because it comes from the other side of the House; but let us all, as members of this great Parliament, which has the fortunes of Australia in its hands, act together in this matter, which is the most important of all, and put aside for the time being all party feeling, saying "" Come, let us reason together ; let us settle what is the right thing to be done, what is fair and liberal, and what will be the best for Australia.""

It appears that those quotations are not sufficient to make the whole statement perfectly clear, and that Commenting upon this, Mr Graham points it was inconvenient at the time for the out: honourable member to read all the figures, or for other honourable members to have to consumption, listen to them.

The suggestion of the Lords of the Treasury is that we should adopt for future Australian coins the wording already adopted on the Australian sovereign and half-sovereign with which we are familiar. That meets the wishes of honourable members since it contains the abbreviation ""Ind. I m p . "" which, however it may sound, means Emperor of India. In these circumstances, a happy solution has been reached. [10.32] I wish to call the attention of the Attorney-General to the action of New South Wales and Victoria with regard to potatoes. I shall quote from an article which appeared in to-day's Age, in order to show that the Commonwealth Government have made, a mistake in not administering the Quarantine Act in such a way that the States shall not quarrel and fight each other. The Age says:Some mild comments were made by the Minister of Agriculture yesterday respecting the unsatisfactory reply of the New South Wales Min. ister to his telegraphed inquiry as to when New South Wales would remove the prohibition against the admission of Victorian potatoes to lhat State. In his telegram Mr Graham stated that merchants were much concerned about the retention of the prohibition, and that Victoria had complied with all the provisions agreed to at the recent conference.

396,,"Mr KINGO ' MALLEY (Darwin)products of other States. I trust that the Attorney-General will at once look into the matter, and will insist that the Commonwealth shall exercise its absolute sovereign power, and not permit a State to interfere with Inter-State trade and commerce. Commonwealth Government that in the United States, when a great disaster has overtaken the producers of a certain portion of the country, the Federal Government places a certain amount on the Estimates to be distributed amongst the sufferers. That is to say, the Government grants a limited amount of compensation. remember when great floods came down the Ohio valley and destroyed the crops of a great number of people. The United States Government sent special trains from Kansas, Missouri, ancl other States, laden with corn, seeds, and material to enable the producers to start again. I think the Commonwealth Government ought to put an amount on the Estimates to compensate the Tasmanian producers who have suffered from the unfortunate trouble that has overtaken them. If Federation does not mean the strong helping the weak, what is the use of it? At any rate, the Attorney General should insist that this miserable, parochial, provincial interference with trade and commerce shall be stopped at once. difficulty in regard to the matter mentioned by the honourable member for Darwin has arisen in consequence of the fact that when the former Deakin Government brought forward a provision in the Quarantine Bill relating to animals and plants, they were not allowed to carry their proposal. But now that the Prime Minister has a considerable majority behind him, I trust that he will bring forward an amendment of the Quarantine Act, taking f u l l power to the Commonwealth in regard to the quarantining of plants and produce. Federation was brought about for the purpose of establishing Inter-State Free Trade. At the present time, we have not Inter-State Free Trade, but Inter-State prohibition. The crops of one State are prohibited because there is a surplus of produce in other States. The pretext is that diseased potatoes must be prohibited; but, as a matter of fact, the importation of absolutely sound potatoes is being stopped. prohibit the spread of disease. the spread of disease must be checked ; but I venture to say that if there was a case of small-pox in Melbourne, this city would not be completely isolated, and Melbourne people would not be prohibited from travelling to other States. Inasmuch as we have hundreds of tons of good potatoes in 1 also wish to point out to the Tasmania, I do not see why they should be excluded from Victoria and New South Wales markets. We have, in fact, hundreds of tons of potatoes produced in districts where there is no disease whatever. Yet they cannot be sent to Victoria at the present time. In my opinion, these States have taken up their present attitude simply I can because their own producers have a f u l l crop, and do not want to have their monopoly broken down. I regret that I was not in the chamber on Friday last when allusion was made to the death of the late Sir Thomas Bent. I was at the moment receiving a deputation of my constituents outside. Otherwise, T should have added my quota to the memory of a great Australian. I knew Sir Thomas Bent-o r rather Tom Bent, as Ave always called him-for over twenty years. With the exception of the Prime Minister, I think that my intimacy with him extended over a longer period than did that of any other member of this House. He was a man of great decision of character. Let me give an instance. At the present time, we have admission cards, by means of which citizens are accommodated in seats in the galleries of this Chamber. They were introduced while Sir 'rjiomas Bent was Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly; and the system was very soon adopted all over Australia. I endeavoured to introduce this method of admission during the Speakership of a previous occupant of the chair; but he could not see the advantage of it. I became familiar with the system years before in London. When Sir Thomas Bent became Speaker, I showed it to him, and in less than five minutes, he had decided to adopt the card method. He sent for the late Mr W. V . Robinson, then Clerk of the Legislative Assembly, and ordered 1,000 cards to be printed forthwith. The same decision of character enabled him to face many great difficulties. Shortly before the crash of the boom came, he had been injured by a stone which fel l from a portion of this building, which is State must now being supported by timber. He was involved in difficulties which clung to him throughout the greater part of the remainder of his life. At this period, I went",63,Adjournment Coinage Inscription Potat O Blight

When there was a danger of his being made insolvent, he was urged to take advantage of the Act which allowed a. person to compromise with his creditors. But he said, "" No; if I go insolvent, I shall be compelled to do so, but I will not of my own accord. I will do the best I can to pay off my creditors."" When I was leader of the unemployed for close on twelve years, I often went to Tom ""Bent for help. On one occasion, he sent up 10 tons of potatoes, of which I superintended the distribution amongst the unemployed. Another fact that has to be mentioned in his honour is that he was one of those who prevented the Melbourne Tramway Company from securing a monopoly for all time. In this matter, he acted in conjunction with the late Mr Godfrey Downes Carter. Through their instrumentality, the lease of the comless I know to express one's feelings, but pany was restricted to thirty-three years. Mr Carter lost his seat; but, nevertheless, without paying a tribute to the memory of the Tramway Company was prevented from securing a monopoly over the streets of Melbourne, from which only a revolution could have shifted them. Another thing that should be mentioned is in relation to the Brighton Tramway. When he asked me for my vote in connection with it, I said, "" I will give it, if you will secure to the workmen eight hours a day, six days a week work, and a minimum of Â£ 2 a week pay.' 1 -He said, "" I will not do it. I think that every man engaged on that work is worth 7s. a day. I will agree to the insertion of a clause providing for the payment of 42s. a week for six days of eight hours each."" The clause was carried, and when the Legislative Council wanted to throw it out he said, ""No. I gave my promise that the Bill would contain the clause. If you will not pass the Bill with the clause, drop it . "" That clause enunciated-for the first time in the history of the world, I believe-the principle of six working days bf eight hours each at 7s. a day. Well do I remember the time when I was making a collection for a member. Knowing how severely Mr Bent had been hit I would not ask him for a subscription, and passed him by. Having learnt from the conversation of other members that I was making a collection, he said, "" Maloney, why did you not ask me for a contribution?"" I replied, "" Mr Bent, I knew that you had been hit too hard, and, therefore, I would not ask you."" ""Look here, my boy,"" he said, taking a sovereign out of his pocket, "" you must take this to the man,' and if 1 were not placed as I am, you could have Â£100 as easily as Â£ 1 . "" I want to impress upon you, Mr Speaker/ that it was with the greatest difficulty that I obtained can . Gillies. I had to insist upon the coffin being opened in order to. get the cast taken. When men loom largely in our Australian firmament, whether it be in the far west or on the sun-dried plains of the centre, or in the northern part of New South Wales, there should be some means by which we could take a cast of their faces so that in the future if it is desired to raise mementoes to them we should have casts available, and the sculptor could prepare for us works which would live much longer than any products of the art of the portrait painter. Words are useI could not allow this opportunity to pass Mr Bent. As a personal friend, I loved him; as a man, when he once gave his word ha kept it, and I can d""ily say of him as a real good Democrat, "" Peace to his ashes, and may God rest his soul."" ter) [10.46] -If I had been in my place in the House last week it would have been my melancholy duty to have expressed our sentiments in regard to the sudden decease bf the late Premier of Victoria; but that duty having been fully and admirably discharged by my honourable colleague, any further tribute would be merely personal. May I say to the honourable member for Darwin that the Quarantine law which is merely exclusive and prohibitive in its character, even if extended, would not affect his particular case,' but that all the proceedings in regard to it are receiving the closest attention of the Attorney-General. We have put ourselves in communication with the States, and are keeping in touch with the matter at every turn. Whenever it is possible that any influence can be exercised, even, as he is aware, were it only a personal influence, I shall endeavour to exercise it on behalf of any who are suffering without justification.
