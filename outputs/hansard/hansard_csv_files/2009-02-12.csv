225,The Speaker,"I say to the member forThursday, 12 February 2009 ----Kalgoorlie Electorate: Alcohol Abuse hol is playing a greater role in social disruption. In my Kimberley towns, as a result of alcohol consumption we are seeing violent assaults, domestic violence, child abuse, child neglect and four out of 10 births affected by foetal alcohol syndrome. Western Australian governments of the last few years have suddenly realised this is going on-it has been happening since the seventies-and they are now putting curbs in place. The wisdom, decided in Fitzroy Crossing, for instance, of limiting the sale of take-away alcohol to that containing nothing in excess of 2.7 per cent alcohol is impacting on the whole town. The result is that the problem drinkers have now moved on to other towns across the Kimberley. The plan now is to impose the same idea on Halls Creek. People of course simply move on if they have a drinking problem and have difficulty in accessing alcohol. They move to other towns and they take the problem there. The police in the prohibited town are of course very happy because they do not have the incidents. Putting ad hoc bans in place in towns because it seems like a good idea at the time, an idea held by some of the people, is not satisfactory. If these preventive measures are put in place in some of my towns, why not put the same restrictions in place in suburban Perth and see how the populace likes it? In addition to that, we are seeing the ad hoc closure of licensed premises if events such as funerals take place because of the violence as a result of the combination of skin groups coming together and the consumption of alcohol. In place of these ad hoc restrictions I propose, across the state, the introduction of a licence to drink. For many years we have realised the danger of motor vehicles. We have had licences to drive and have insisted that people so licensed are instructed in the process of driving a dangerous motor vehicle. I propose that the same idea be adopted in relation to the purchase and consumption of alcohol and that all persons legally entitled to do so carry identification and a card which says they continue to be entitled to do so. Any offences that they commit and are found guilty of would result in the taking away of their licence to purchase and consume alcohol. In the long term this would be the only way to put an effective law in place that did not find the innocent disrupted and the guilty moved on to another town. Something must be done. The ad hoc arrangements which have now been put in place in the Kimberley by the Western Australian government will not work in the long term. We need to be very sure that, instead of shunting the problem elsewhere, we address the problem for all time across the state, especially in the areas where it is causing a problem.

The partnership between the local community and my office made for a very constructive day. More than 70 active community members attended the forum, which included people with disabilities, parents, carers and service providers. A series of syndicate discussions were held, each facilitated by an elected chair and assisted by a secretary, to ensure that each community member had a proper opportunity to have their views noted. A number of community members who are actively engaged in the disability sector were not able to attend on the day. However, we ensured that they had the opportunity to complete written questionnaires, all of which were included in our final submission. The outcome of the forum was very informative, and at times the process was very emotional and very tense. The main points arising from the forum included access, accommodation, education, employment, finance, health, transport, volunteers and a whole-of-life approach for people with disabilities. Besides these obvious outcomes, on the day I received numerous comments from people who attended about how pleased they were that the federal government had taken this initiative, and they hoped that their comments as they applied to the south-west of Sydney and the disability sector generally would be taken into consideration. Further, it was strongly felt that this type of forum should be held on an annual basis in order to monitor and review the implementation of the National Disability Strategy. The forum highlighted to me once again the strength of the community, not only of those who attended but also those who assisted in the organisation of the day. The forum acted as a positive exercise to reinforce and to strengthen the disability networks that apply throughout the south-west of Sydney. Quite frankly it showed once again the spirit of those who live and work with disabilities, and they showed themselves in such a way that we should do what we can to support them now and into the future. Casey Electorate: Mr Cliff Dohle Dohle, who passed away on 2 February. Cliff was a Lilydale resident. He was a great Australian. He was someone who served this nation with distinction. He was a helicopter pilot in Vietnam; he was a helicopter pilot in the Battle of Long Tan. In 2006, after the 40th Anniversary of Long Tan Day, I spoke in the Main Committee about Cliff’s magnificent contribution. All members are familiar with the Battle of Long Tan. It is the battle that Vietnam Veterans Day is named after. On that day when 6RAR were confronted with an overwhelming force of the Vietcong in a rubber plantation just a short way from Nui Dat, Australian helicopter pilots Cliff Dohle and others resupplied 6RAR at the critical time of the battle. Had they not done so we would be remembering Long Tan in very different terms today. Cliff is one of the great heroes of that time. He was part of a generation that served Australia so very well. He passed away just over a week ago, and his wife, Joan, and his children, Helen, Peter and Lisa, remembered his great contribution at a very touching funeral service in Seville. The Australian nation and this parliament owe much to the Cliff Dohles who served this country with such distinction. We owe much to that generation who fought in Vietnam to MAIN COMMITTEE",222,Constituency Statements

His contribution as a member of the Air Force is very much part of our history-history we should remember and commemorate. (Time expired) Port Adelaide Electorate: Community Food SA Inc. not-for profit-community centre, Community Food SA Inc. Community Food SA is a fantastic hub that provides low-cost food and groceries to low-income families and individuals in Adelaide, with a focus on the north-western and north-eastern suburbs. Established in 1989, Community Food SA has generously served the public for almost two decades and has around 80 committed volunteers offering affordable groceries for new arrivals, the unemployed, people with disabilities and pensioners. I am very proud of South Australia’s volunteer participation rate, sitting at around 600,000 active volunteers or about 50 per cent of the South Australian adult population. I think this says something about the spirit of our southern state. Community Food SA volunteers have also been acknowledged with several awards for service to the community, including the Australia Day Award and Citizen of the Year by the Port Adelaide Enfield Council. The food centre also offers opportunities for work experience to those in the community who would otherwise be excluded from practical experience in a busy work environment, making the participants more likely to find paid work as a result. The true litmus test is the high patronage levels at the centre’s Cromwell Road premises. Approximately 1,500 people visit the food outlet at Kilburn each week, which services around 500 to 600 families. Practical everyday items are available like fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, dairy products and fresh bread at lower resale amounts than at the average supermarket, allowing families to purchase what they need, not just what they can afford. This also provides shoppers with the option to buy healthier choices like fresh fruit and produce that they may otherwise not be able to afford. The centre has many other benefits, including the incorporation of Arnolds Cafe, a low-cost cafe with a family-friendly atmosphere providing opportunities for members of the community to meet other locals, make new friends and establish important social support networks. For many low-income families, the shopping experience can bring on feelings of anxiety and despair-the stress of examining budgets on a daily basis and relying on the generosity of others to make ends meet. The community food centre helps ease some of the burdens on households by incorporating other practical initiatives like courses and demonstrations on cooking nutritious meals on a budget and managing family finances. Often the quickest and cheapest meals are not the most nutritious or, in the long term, in the health interests of the consumer. This cooking program helps to improve eating options for families. The successful Community Food SA Inc. model is a great asset to the local community in and around the electorate of Port Adelaide and one that I would recommend other jurisdictions around the country emulate to benefit those who are most in need of assistance and support. MAIN COMMITTEE",223,Constituency Statements
230,Mr Butler (Port Adelaide) (9.39 Am),"I would like to share today the success story of aNational Service tional servicemen’s plaque at Stroud conducted by Jim Olsen, President of the Dungog National Servicemen Association’s sub-branch. I was proud to participate in honouring those sons of Stroud who had served our nation well as national servicemen from 1951 to 1972. I congratulate John Bowen and Jim Bratfield for the work that they have done in organising the funding and research for the memorial. National service was certainly not popular. The wearing of a uniform and regulation haircuts was always a battle-most conscripts hated being lumped together and made to look alike-but we see them now as proud old blokes on parade wearing their national service gong on a blue jacket over grey trousers, wearing the tie and the black beret and belonging together. How ironic that the majority now believe that national service should be reintroduced for their sons and grandsons to instil discipline. When you look back at the history of conscription, one thing does stand out-that is, every young Australian who donned the uniform, be it conscription or regular, served with absolute distinction. The roll of honour is long and very distinguished. Between 1951 and 1972, of the 287,000 young men called up for service in the Navy, Army and Air Force, sadly 212 died on active service-two in Borneo and 210 in Vietnam-and 1,279 were wounded. The majority of these Nashos posted to fighting battalions did not stay behind in Australia when their unit was posted to Vietnam. They trained with them and they died with them. The courage and skill of the Vietnam diggers came to the fore on 18 August 1966 in Long Tan. Of the 124 diggers of D company, 6RAR, 64 were Nashos and 60 Regulars. Death did not discriminate. Of the 18 military personnel killed in the Battle of Long Tan, 11 were Nashos and seven were Regulars. Later that year the diggers triumphed in the battles at Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral. They fought together and they died together as one in these enormous battles. For those who did not have the opportunity to participate in active service, let me say that without their service we as an Australian force fighting overseas would not have survived. No matter where they served, they made many sacrifices: families, girlfriends, jobs, income. This was recognised some years back with the introduction of the national service medal, and they should be very, very proud to wear it. It is good and well for diggers to meet at times like those, to look back at their achievements and the history and be able to say, ‘Together then, together again.’ I look forward to addressing our national servicemen this anniversary day, Saturday, 14 February at Foster, and paying my respects to these sons of Australia. Makin Electorate: Mr Don Lindner legendary Australian Rules footballer and a South Australian icon. Sadly, Don Lindner passed away suddenly on New Year’s Eve while celebrating with his wife Jan and some friends. He was 73 years of age. Don Lindner began his league football career in 1954, aged 19, with the North Adelaide Football Club. He retired from league football in 1970 and at that stage had played around 289 league games, including having represented South Australia 16 times. Amongst his many football achievements, he was a joint winner of the 1967 Magarey Medal. He was selected for the all-Australian side of 1961, he captained North Adelaide from 1963 to 1969 and he also coached the team from 1963 to 1966. In 2002, Don was an inaugural inductee into the South Australian Football Hall of Fame. MAIN COMMITTEE",224,Constituency Statements

232,Mr Zappia (Makin) (9.45 Am),"I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Don Lindner, aDon Lindner was particularly renowned for his sensational high marking. In speaking at his funeral, South Australia’s greatest footballer, Barrie Robran, remarked that, in his opinion, Don Lindner was the best high marker to play the sport. I know that anyone who has seen Don Lindner play would not disagree with that statement. Football today has changed markedly from the way it was played in the 1950s and 1960s, so it is very difficult to draw comparisons between footballers of that era and footballers of today. I have no doubt, however, that if there had been a national football competition similar to the AFL when Don Lindner was playing, his would be a household name not only in South Australia but throughout Australia. Don Lindner was a dominant character both on the field and off the field. To quote Graham Cornes in the Adelaide Advertiser on 3 January 2009: Never was there a character larger than life itself, more confident in his ability and more striking in his persona … You knew when Don was in the room. People looked up to Don Lindner, both literally and metaphorically. To many he was affectionately referred to ‘ Sir Donald’ or simply ‘the Don’. Off the field, Don Lindner was a successful livestock agent, managing the family business known as the House of Lindner. Through that business, he also became a South Australian identity in the livestock and farming communities. He continued to manage the business until the end. It became clear from listening to the many speakers at his funeral service that Don Lindner enjoyed life to the full and, equally, brought so much enjoyment to others. He entertained football fans and inspired young footballers, including the great Barrie Robran, who I understand went to North Adelaide from Whyalla in 1966 as a young, promising footballer to play with his then football hero. On Friday, 9 January, Don Lindner was given a fitting send-off with around 1,500 people, including many distinguished South Australians, attending his funeral service at Immanuel College. To his wife Jan, his family members and his colleagues and supporters at the North Adelaide Football Club, I extend my sympathies and express my personal sadness at the passing of Don Lindner. Forrest Electorate: Ms Claire Davies Ms MARINO (Forrest) (9.48 am)-I wish to acknowledge the life of a beautiful little girl in my electorate of Forrest and pay tribute to her strength and generosity. Claire Davies was a brave 13-year-old girl from Capel who suffered from a complex cyanotic heart disease. Claire died in her sleep early on Saturday morning, 7 February, at home, surrounded by her close family. Her funeral is today, Thursday, 12 February, at the community hall in Capel. She will be farewelled by her close family: her father, Steve; her mother, Vicki; her older sisters, Cecelia and Bronwyn; and her 12-year-old brother, Mostyn. Claire defied the odds since being diagnosed with an extremely rare heart disease when she was just six weeks old. Claire packed a lot of activities into her short life. She played piano and was head girl at her school, Capel Primary School, in 2007. In 2008, she championed a number of events. She survived her fifth open heart surgery in January, a 12-hour surgical marathon that claimed her right leg and left her in a coma for two weeks, and she was chosen to be the Channel7 Regional Telethon child in the telethon held in October 2008. She graciously took on the role and represented sick children throughout Western Australia. I am told she also encouraged all regional areas to get behind her. She was excited to be part of the teleMAIN COMMITTEE thon fundraising event, and saw her wish come true when more than $7 million was raised for telethon. Claire was the junior bridesmaid at her sister Bronwyn’s wedding that took place on the very same weekend as the 2008 Channel7 telethon. Claire would have turned 14 next month, on 9 March. The South West and telethon communities are in mourning at the very sad passing of Claire, and a public funeral is being catered for to honour her very short but special life. In keeping with Claire’s generosity of spirit, the family asked that instead of sending flowers, people could make donations to the cardiology unit at Princess Margaret Hospital, HeartKids WA, Make-a-Wish Foundation and Ronald McDonald House. My thoughts and condolences go out to Steve, Vicki, Cecelia, Bronwyn and Mostyn for their loss, the loss of a much loved, courageous and precious daughter and sister. Ballarat Electorate: Sebastopol College Ms KING (Ballarat) (9.50 am)-I want to put on record my support for and recognition of one of the schools in my electorate, Sebastopol College. There was a fairly awful incident that occurred at Sebastopol College last Friday, one which made the national news-the stabbing of one of the students. I do not wish to dwell on the incident that occurred there at all, but I do want to put on record that in the time that I have been involved in the school-some nine or so years now-I can say that the events that happened on Friday bear no resemblance to the school that I have seen develop and grow under the very fantastic principalship of Garry Taylor. It is really an absolutely terrific school. The school has close to 1,000 students, and every time. I have been into the school or interacted with students outside the school they have shown themselves to be a respectful, energetic, interested and terrific group of young people. The principal, Garry Taylor, is probably one of the best secondary school principals I have seen across the country. I am extremely biased, but Garry has really done a fantastic job in leading his team of teachers in growing and developing this school. The school has been absolutely active in pursuing government funding of late. They have had some fantastic announcements and there is another one soon to come. They have been a recipient of the computers in schools fund-195 new computers will be going into Sebastopol College-and I would say that probably once every three weeks, Allan Dennis, from the school, has rung my office to make sure that they were going to get the funding for this program. They have been absolutely determined to increase the number of computers at their school. I am also particularly pleased that they are one of the recipients of the Local Schools Working Together program. That program has sought to encourage schools to work together with their local communities to develop shared education facilities, and $2.476 million has been allocated to Sebastopol College as the host school-alongside Redan and Sebastopol primary schools-to develop a community hub in this very, very important area of my electorate. I really want to reiterate that this is a fantastic school. The students have worked incredibly hard to make sure that people in the district know what a terrific school it is. It is host to a thousand school students. It was once a much smaller school and, every time. I go to their assemblies each year, there is more and more that is on show, whether it is their drama and performance, their hospitality, their engineering trades areas, some of their academic and sporting qualifications or the Army cadets program that they have in the school. All of it shows that the students are a great credit to the school. I really do want to put on record my support for the MAIN COMMITTEE school. It was a terrible incident that occurred last Friday, but I know that it does not in any way reflect the strength and good conduct of Sebastopol College generally. Egypt: Poverty took during the Christmas break. I took this study tour because I was inspired here, at a prayer breakfast, by a woman who came along and spoke about poverty in Egypt. As many people in this House know, I have travelled the length and breadth of this country on foot and I have seen some of the poverty in some of the outback areas of Australia but, I have to tell you, I have seen nothing like the things I saw in the tips there in Egypt. I would just, in this brief moment, like to say a few things about that, let alone the poverty in Peru and Nepal. I travelled to the rubbish tips with a lady that goes by the name of Mama Maggie. We wandered into a house with 10 children and the mother living there. The place is two metres by two metres, a tin shanty. I walked in, and in this room there was a bed, some cardboard boxes against the wall which had all their worldly possessions, and an LP gas bottle which they use for cooking. Many of the kids in Cairo suffer from burns as a result of bumping the cooker during the night, because they have no water and no electricity. I stepped outside and saw a plastic bowl covered in rats, and that bowl had the water in it that they use for drinking, washing themselves and mixing into some sort of porridge that they share and eat for the week. I scrubbed the kids’ feet along with Mama Maggie. We scrubbed their feet and their hands. I cleaned and dressed some of their sores. She then read them a passage from the Bible and we provided each of the kids, after washing their faces as well, with a pair of plastic shoes and a little parcel of food the size of two hands that was going to feed this family for the next two weeks. The reason why I speak about this and why I continue to speak about my adventures during the Christmas break is that I want to inspire other members in this place, when they have the opportunity to travel overseas, to not just meet with the dignitaries in those countries but also travel to some of the poverty stricken places and do some first hand work with some of the NGOs, whether it be the medical organisations, the Red Cross, Rotary et cetera or some of the religious organisations. See the poverty first hand and get involved. Do some building, do some reading in the schools or help out in the hospitals. See these things first hand. I think people can come to this place and lobby us as much as they like, but when you have smelt the smells of these places and worked with the people in these places and seen it first hand, it really does affect the way that you think about things. I cannot help but think that I make a much better politician for having had that experience, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do exactly the same and, when they get these opportunities to travel overseas, to do that. Don’t just take notes but also get heavily involved and have some hands-on experience. Volunteer Grants Program Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (9.57 am)-Under the Australian government’s Volunteer Grants Program, my electorate of Calwell received a total of $91,262 in funding which was allocated across 24 local community groups. The range of successful groups gives a valuable snapshot of the extent of community activity and interest in my electorate of Calwell. Overall, Calwell is not a wealthy electorate if measured in dollars or property values, but it is extremely rich in social capital-the invaluable qualities of compassion, caring for community, interest in helping others and working together for the greater good. MAIN COMMITTEE",225,Constituency Statements
233,Mr Farmer (Macarthur) (9.53 Am),"I want to speak briefly about a study tour that IAmongst the grant recipients, we have groups dedicated to the preservation of the local history, culture and natural heritage of the area such as the Broadmeadows Historical Society and the Friends of Woodlands Historic Park. We also have groups providing sporting activities for a range of age groups such as the Donnybrook Cricket Club, the Gladstone Park Tennis Club, the Hume City Swimming Club, the Archery in Schools Program, the Sunbury Little Athletics Centre and the Hume University of the Third Age, which offers a terrific weight-training program for older people. We have multicultural groups promoting mutual support and harmony through diversity such as the Community in Harmony group, the Meadow Heights Turkish Women’s Association, the St Addai Community Society, the St Oprahaa Association and the Shranish Association as well as groups offering spiritual support and well-being, including the North Victorian Buddhist Association and the Sunbury Baptist Church. Of course, we also have a wide range of general service organisations that offer so much to the community at large through fundraising, emergency services, practical assistance and skills development for their members. These include the Campbellfield Lions, the Clarkfield Fire Brigade, the Full Gas Peddlers, Networking Women, the North Metro Region Girl Guides, the Sunbury Girl Guides, the Craigieburn and District First Response Team, the Craigieburn Scout Group and the Craigieburn Rover Crew. There are many more vibrant and hard working community organisations in Calwell, and unfortunately not all of them were able to receive grants under the Volunteer Grants Program. I wish, however, to acknowledge their importance nonetheless. I wish to congratulate those groups who were successful in this round, and while the grants are relatively small amounts of money they will hopefully make a real difference, enabling groups to purchase vital basic equipment, relieve the burden of fuel costs and improve the services community groups can offer to their members and to the communities they serve. The additional value of the grants is the recognition they offer to those who invest so much of their time, energy, skills and dedication to keeping these organisations running. I also congratulate the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs for initiating this terrific program which supports the not-for-profit sector at its most grassroots and arguably most important level. 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. Victorian Bushfire Victims Debate resumed from 11 February, on motion by Ms Gillard: That the House: (1) extends its deepest sympathies to families and loved ones of those Australians killed in the weekend’s tragic bushfires in Victoria; (2) records its deep regret at the human injury, the loss of property and the destruction of communities caused by the weekend’s fires; (3) praises the work of emergency services, volunteers and community members in assisting friends and neighbours in this time of need; and (4) acknowledges the profound impact on those communities affected and the role of governments and the Australian community in assisting their recovery and rebuilding. MAIN COMMITTEE",228,Constituency Statements
234,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"Order! In accordance with standing orderDeputy Prime Minister. I am so sorry for all the families who have lost loved ones in these fires. I know the thoughts of all my constituents in Lyons are with the victims. They would want me to pass on their condolences and their sympathy to their fellow Australians in Victoria. To the survivors I say: do not feel guilty. I saw television footage this morning of a counsellor talking of people coming down from the fire affected areas feeling guilty because they had survived. They should not think that way. There is always a reason for survival, and really their job now is to rebuild and renew in the memory of those who have perished. I know they will always have challenging moments. Most of them have lost houses and will have difficult memories, but we know that time heals. Soon, after the last fire in Victoria is put out, the big job of rebuilding Victoria will begin. Bushfires are a fact of life in Australia. They have always been with us, but I certainly do not think anybody was ready for the speed and ferocity that drove those fires that caught so many people unprepared. It is unimaginable what those people went through. I do not think we will ever really know the feelings of the survivors who somehow managed, phoenix like, to rise from those ashes and the devastation of their world. It is not something that one would ever forget; the effects will certainly haunt those survivors for many years. We need to remember that and ensure that there is assistance for them into the future. This terrible event will leave the survivors, the emergency service workers and every affected person emotionally, if not physically-certainly many suffered physically, as we know-affected. The recovery process must start, and they will need our help in that. Because of the scale of this disaster, there need to be changes to the way we look at and live in fire prone areas. I am sure that we will be forced to reassess how best to face this sort of challenge in the future. I see some of those questions starting to emerge in the media this morning. It was interesting last night listening to the member for Lingiari speak of his experience of arriving in Darwin just after the cyclone, where all the new houses were built with cyclone shelters. Whether we look at fire shelters and community shelters is something for us to consider in the future. I sat on the Canberra bushfire inquiry and, apart from the possible use of shelters, one thing that stood out was looking at the way, and where, houses should be built. I remember seeing the fires along the east coast of Tasmania in 2006. As I drove through a day later I saw many signs, such as ‘do not defend’, warning fire crews of an impossible driveway to get a tanker in and out of and of the subsequent danger. Warnings not to defend some of those areas were given by the higher authorities. These are decisions that many people do not think about until we have these sorts of events. The issue of preburning fuel or reduction burning-I think ‘prescriptive burning’ is another term that is used-is also an issue on which we need to have public debate. Firefighters have said that, if there have been reduction burns and you set up a mosaic type pattern across your forest areas and you keep a record of that, it is even better for fire management. When a very fast-moving fire hits where there has been a reduction of fuel two years before, that fire will slow down, and that gives firefighters an opportunity to build their lines and back-burn to meet the fire as it comes towards them. These are things that need to be a part of the science MAIN COMMITTEE",229,Condolences
235,Mr Adams (Lyons) (10.00 Am),"I rise to speak on the condolence motion moved by theof building into the future, and we need to consider them more than we have done, possibly, in the past. These Victorian fires are a harsh and grim reminder of the 1967 bushfires in Tasmania, which claimed about 61 lives. Coincidentally, they started on the same day, 7 February, and I understand the situation was similar, with many fires racing and joining together. The wind, temperature and dryness were right for limiting the chances of survival. Temperatures may have reached up to 3,000 degrees, as has been shown by the melting of metal on some cars. That is an incredible temperature, one which we just cannot imagine coming from a bushfire. In the 1967 bushfires, a former Hobart couple were burnt out and lost their home in Fern Tree, which is one of the suburbs at the foot of the mountain at the back of Hobart. Exactly 42 years later they were in Kinglake and they were lucky to survive-but, with terrible fortune, they lost their home. They decided to leave 10 or 15 minutes before their house was completely destroyed and they managed to shelter at the fire station until the worse had past. This couple are, I think, now in their 80s, and 42 years ago they went through a similar experience. I have had a report from the timber communities in Tasmania of the terribly sad news from the Tasmanian Forest Festival Committee that Errol and Harley Morgan’s lives have been lost in the fires in Victoria. Errol and Harley were regular travellers from Victoria to Tasmania to support the festival’s chainsaw carving events down in the forest areas of southern Tasmania. There must be thousands of such stories across Australia this week, and people will mourn for their friends and relatives for a long time to come. We had terrible fires on the east coast of Tasmania in 2006-in Scamander, in the areas of St Helens and St Mary’s and in the Fingal Valley where many houses were destroyed but, fortunately, there was no loss of life thanks to the effort of so many volunteer firefighters, including my then staff member, Ian Gabites and one of my best mates, Fred Hannam. However, in the clean-up, a young forestry worker was killed. He died when a large tree that had been burnt out at the bottom fell onto his ute. He was one of about three or four in a family from the Fingal Valley. So the aftermath can be as deadly as some of the fires. One needs to be vigilant when doing these clean-ups because there are probably many trees still standing which are not standing by very much. Last week’s disaster must be the worse in the history of Australia and it is difficult to come to terms with it. To open the Australian newspaper this morning and see the photographs of those young people was a very sad thing for me. I participated in the parliament’s inquiry into the Canberra bushfires. I believe there are some connections between those fires and the Victorian fires and, like the previous reports and royal commissions that have been undertaken over the years in Australia, I think there is a lot of information there that could also be useful. I have been very proud to be a member of the parliament this week. I think the parliament has acquitted itself in a magnificent way. It is a credit to every member and a credit to the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business in the House for negotiating things that allowed members to deal with their electorates and which allowed every member to express their concerns. I think we as the parliament have done ourselves very proud this week, and I am very honoured to be a part of it. MAIN COMMITTEE I think Phil Cheney has read the situation correctly. With these current unstable weather conditions and the build-up of fuel over many years in heavily wooded areas, there is bound to be a point when disaster will hit. The ferocity of the fires appears to be due to very high temperatures and strong winds. The other, very sad part of all this is the fact that some of these fires were deliberately lit. No wonder so many people died and so much property has been destroyed. Of course, it is always easy in hindsight to put together reasons for disaster, but we now need to ensure that it never happens again on the scale that we have just seen. But the immediate danger has not yet passed. Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, we know that in your state there are still fires burning to a great extent. I saw some reports this morning of concern that two fires might join together and create even more havoc. I should mention the emergency services. The Tasmania Fire Service and their equipment are in Victoria. The defence forces and other communities are fighting those fires, and they need to be commended for all the work that they have done. I certainly hope that there is counselling and good support for these people who have experienced some difficult work. It is after the fires have gone, the funds have been distributed, the houses have been rebuilt and some semblance of order returns, that the whole trauma of the experience may hit again and again. We have seen this, of course, in Defence Force personnel and we saw it in Tasmania, and I saw it in my electorate, after the Port Arthur massacre. We still see it on the east coast of Tasmania after the fires there. The horror of those memories can sometimes creep back. Then, more than at any other time, we need the funds and the assistance for those trauma victims. There was a very good project post the 2006 fires in Tasmania. A book was put together called Regenerate, for the regeneration of the communities and the forests, involving many people, including the University of Tasmania through the Launceston campus. There was a lot of very good work done on the social need of rebuilding communities as well as the physical rebuilding. I commend that work. A professor involved in the project went to a conference in Scotland, with which I was able to assist slightly, and was able to investigate on an international level some of the issues that communities need to face after such dramatic events. I think there is a new role for volunteers to play. Maybe some of the survivors might be able to develop survival plans; those who have managed to survive these fires may have some very good information that they can pass on-some very critical lessons may be learnt. No two fires are ever the same, but there are many things to learn from each fire and from its survivors. The support we have seen from many Australians and from many people all over the world has been amazing. The Tasmanian state member for Lyons, Heather Butler, who grew up around Marysville and went on her honeymoon there and loved its beauty and tranquillity, was so distressed by what she saw the other day that she got together with all the other politicians in Tasmania and organised a clothes collection. Within minutes the news went out and supplies started to come in. My staff tell me that yesterday two rooms at my offices were totally packed with contributions and more was still coming in. Most of this clothing was brand new, sorted and packed according to age and gender. The people of Lyons know what fire is like. They know what community is all about and how to work in times of adversity. They give and they give, and I am told that it is the same right around the state of Tasmania. MAIN COMMITTEE In times like this, politics and rivalries are forgotten and people show their care and concern for those who have lost so much. I had forest contractors ringing me the day before yesterday to offer their rigs and bulldozers and so on to help start the clean-up in Victoria and make areas safe. They were willing to volunteer their work and their gear, and I think the state government was looking at whether they could ferry them across Bass Strait to assist. I am sure many other Australians are doing exactly the same. I also want to pay tribute to ABC Radio. I believe they are the key to keeping information flowing in the fire areas. When television, mobile phones and power failures halt information flow just about altogether, most people have a hand-held battery radio. I have listened to some of the early fire reports as they were being received; information from the SES and fire authorities was coming through. About two weeks ago I was in the southern part of Tasmania and we had a horrific storm. The place where I was staying lost its power and I had no power source but a battery-operated radio and the local ABC. The main highway between Hobart and Launceston was cut because of a major fire, and about 25 power poles came down, bringing down all the wiring. My wife was driving south and I was trying to get information, which was difficult, but of course that was supplied by the ABC. I also remember the great role that Tim Cox and his crew played at St Marys during the fires in Tasmania in 2006. SoI send a special thank you to the ABC for the work they have done in these fires as well. Australia was built on adversity and Australians, whether from Indigenous or European stock, can survive most awful situations-whether it is a natural disaster, a personal one or a financial one. Once again I see us rising to help the country get back on its feet, and I am sure that all the goodwill that we are feeling in this parliament and that we are feeling coming from right around Australia will help those people in Victoria, will help us cope, and will help Victoria to rebuild and help the people to put their lives somewhat back together. condolence. It is very hard to know what to make of a tragedy of the scale of what we have witnessed with Victoria’s bushfires. Several hundred people taken in the blink of an eye: how do we rationalise it? How do we come to terms with it? How do we make sense of it? Sometimes there is simply no explanation-no cause, no effect, at times no-one to blame. Sometimes in this great south land of rugged mountain ranges, of droughts and flooding rains, indeed a land of fire, sometimes things go horribly wrong. With thousands homeless, hundreds perished, the images are reminiscent of a battlefield. Having been in the civil war in Bougainville and having seen the effects of a battlefield on the town of Arawa-a town of 30,000 almost wiped off the map-these are first scenes I have seen in Australia that come close to the horror of what a civil war can deliver. Families have perished together. We have seen dreadful and haunting photographs of small children, mums, dads and grandparents; images of charred swings floating in the breeze, looking down on a charred, barren and black landscape. Amidst the horror and tragedy, there are stories of great courage, as there always are: of CFA volunteers, of neighbours people hardly knew, of safety, of survival, of families coming together to defend one house-watching their own homes perish but knowing that, staying together united, they could survive. My heart goes out to those who are surviving, to those who are fighting the fires, and to the men and women of 4 CER as they work to provide logistics and other engineering support to assist with fighting this most dreadful fire. MAIN COMMITTEE",230,Condolences
236,Mr Robert (Fadden) (10.22 Am),"I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for this motion ofLet me continue to encourage all Australians to give as they have so generously done. Donations can be made at any of our major financial institutions, at the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, who are an incredible organisation, and at Bunnings. So many tens of millions of dollars have already been provided by generous Australians and businesses, which is even more noteworthy considering the difficult economic conditions the nation finds itself in. I am so encouraged to hear the member for Lyons speak of what politicians are doing in Tasmania and, whilst I am sure the inconvenience of his office filled with clothes will quickly pass, the gesture of what his office has done will last a lifetime. Let me also encourage all Australians to be prepared. Kyle Watson, who lives in my electorate, is a co-founder of the Foundation of Public Safety Professionals. A public safety professional has put together documentation on how to put together a family safety plan. I spoke to Kyle yesterday. I certainly apologised to him for not making sure his work was more publicly known. Kyle’s mother has lost her home twice due to bushfires. As a public safety professional, he has put together a family safety plan, a four or five page document, that helps families plan for cyclones, flooding, fire, hazardous spills, earthquakes, tsunamis and storms. I will certainly endeavour to get this to every member of parliament so they can use it as they wish. In the midst of the tragedy my personal faith in God somehow does not provide a full explanation. But it does let me know that he comes to us as a fellow sufferer through his son Jesus. It is what the apostle Paul refers to as entering into the fellowship of suffering. One day in heaven we may understand all things but right now, in these dark days, it is a great consolation to know that in the midst of it, whilst we cannot understand all things and what has happened is beyond understanding and the death of families and small children in an horrific fire is something so difficult to comprehend, I know that our God is with us and shares our pain. Let me conclude by looking at Ecclesiastes chapter 3, which I will paraphrase. There is a time for everything and a season for every activity under the sun. There is a time to be born; there is a time to plant; there is a time to weep; there will be a time to laugh; there is a time to mourn; there will be a time to dance; there has been a time to scatter stones; there will be a time to gather them; there is a time to embrace; there is a time to search; there is a time to keep; there is a time to love; there is a time for peace. Right now there is a time to heal and there will be-and I know this parliament commits itself to-a time to build. me say from the outset, I have listened to so many of the speakers in respect to this motion and there is not much that can be said that has not already been said, but I certainly associate myself with the remarks of each and every one of the members of the House who have spoken on the matter. In years to come stories will be told, books will be written and perhaps even films will be made about the horrors and the heroism of the bushfires that are still burning in Victoria. Saturday7 February 2009 will become entrenched in the Australian story. By all accounts and from listening to members of this place who spoke with personal knowledge, the bushfires which raged mercilessly through Victoria, taking with them so many lives, were simply unimaginable-but they were real. No one could have been prepared for such a tragedy because never before have the weather conditions associated with those fires been the same. MAIN COMMITTEE",233,Condolences
237,Mr Zappia (Makin) (10.28 Am),"I too associate myself with this condolence motion. LetComing from a state that is prone to devastating bushfires, South Australia, I can empathise with the people of Victoria. However, given the magnitude of the Victorian fires, I can only begin to imagine what it must have been like. On Saturday as I watched the television footage of what was unfolding, my heart sank. Saturday was also an extremely hot day in Adelaide. I would step outside just to see and feel the hot northerly wind blowing through Adelaide to try and get an understanding of what it must have been like in Victoria at that time with the bushfires raging. My thoughts immediately went back to the Bali bombings and New York on September 11, 2001-an inferno, no escape and so many innocent lives lost. I try to imagine what it must have been like for the victims, for the survivors and for the families and friends of both. The thoughts are unthinkable. These are or were fellow Australians and more than 180 of them are now deceased. These are 180 fellow Australians who had families, who had dreams, who had lives to live and who were contributing to the social prosperity of their local communities and to that of our nation-who lost their lives in such a horrific way. Bushfires are not new to Australia. Our country has a long history of them, but never before have they been of the kind that occurred on this occasion. Sadly, the complete picture is yet to be revealed and the death toll is expected to rise. Other members have expressed their gratitude to the rescue workers, one and all, and to all the organisations and to each and every individual who in their own ways participated in the rescue operations and to the subsequent support services. I add my gratitude to all of those people. I also now especially acknowledge the forensic police officers, the defence personnel and the firefighters who have the traumatic job of recovering bodies, identifying them, reconstructing the death scene and notifying family members. It must be a gut-wrenching task. We can rebuild the homes, the farms and the buildings that were lost on Saturday, but we cannot rebuild the lives that were lost. Nor can we ever fully restore the lives of the family members and friends of those who died. At times like this, that phrase ‘if only’ will be asked over and over again by those who survived the ordeal and by the families and friends of those who did not. But nothing will change what has come to pass. Our thoughts must now turn to those who need our help and to whom help can be provided. I have every faith that all Australians will respond to that call, as so many have already done. As a South Australian I support and was heartened by the immediate South Australian government response of a $1 million donation to the Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund and to the deployment to Victoria last Sunday of 70 South Australian Country Fire Service volunteers and staff. On Sunday evening at Adelaide airport I briefly spoke with South Australian Country Fire Service chief Euan Fergusson; the logistics officer, Arthur Tindall, who I have known for many years; and the South Australian Minister for Emergency Services, Michael Wright, who were there overseeing the departure of the South Australians. It was good to see them there. It restores your faith in human behaviour. We always spar with Victoria on a whole range of other matters, but you know when the chips are down that is when your true character emerges and that is when you really see what people are made of. I can assure all Victorians that at times like this the people of South Australia are with them 100 per cent. As with any human tragedy-and I was pleased to hear the member for Fadden quote a biblical passage in respect of this very point-there is a time for grieving and there is a time for rebuilding. Right now communities in Victoria are grieving and the people of Australia MAIN COMMITTEE grieve with them, as we also grieve for the people of North Queensland who have been through their own nightmare in the form of floods. I know I speak on behalf of all of my South Australian colleagues in this place and I believe I speak on behalf of all South Australians in expressing to the people who survived this ordeal, to the relatives and friends of those who did not and to the communities who lost their mates our profound sorrow for what you have been through in your suffering and in what you will live through in the days, months and years ahead. Our thoughts and prayers are with you all. Dr NELSON (Bradfield) (10.34 am)-The Greek dramatist Aeschylus wrote: … pain that cannot forget Falls drop by drop upon the heart, But in our sleep, against our will, Comes wisdom through the awful grace of God. It was the late Robert Kennedy who evoked the memory of Aeschylus after the tragedy of the assassination of Martin Luther King. But here we are in 2009, in our own country, with all Australians wanting to put their arms, collectively and individually, around Victorians who have lost their loved ones, their identity, their meaning and their homes in what is the worse natural disaster that has beset this nation since the arrival of our European ancestors. It is a deep, permeating pain that will go through not only the lives of those who have been directly affected but also through the volunteers, the CFA, the emergency workers, all of those police officers, the forensics, the army people and every single person who, directly and indirectly, is involved in trying to come to terms with this in a very practical and, indeed, emotional way. We who are quite distant from it have had many images presented to us over the last few days via photographs, film and descriptions: a man and a woman described lying next to one another with their dog, found deceased; a man standing on a roof in a pair of shorts, hosing the roof to protect children in the dwelling; the image-which we understand was taken in burn-offs in the previous week-of the CFA firefighter holding the paw of a koala bear and giving it a drink. Whilst that image is not directly, I understand, part of this tragedy itself, it is nonetheless saying something about the sort of people that we want to be. There was also the image of the panel van, its driver having driven, obviously in desperation, from the home to the dam’s edge. We understand that the driver and any other occupants are yet to be found. There are so many images that those of us who have never experienced anything like this cannot even begin to understand. I have had the privilege to be in this parliament for almost 13 years, and I must say that I regard the speech given by the member for McMillan as the finest that I have heard. It was not necessarily the most erudite or anything like that, but it was the most moving, graphic, and sincere depiction of what has been endured, and is being endured, by these people. I also have an extraordinarily high regard for the contributions made by all other members of the parliament, and I think that it says a lot about the men and women who represent people the length and breadth of this country, irrespective of their political party, that our parliament has tried to rise-and has risen-to the occasion during these heinous events. I would also like to pay tribute to Fran Bailey, the member for McEwen-as others on both sides have done-for what she has been doing, and is doing, for her own community through all of this. MAIN COMMITTEE One of those people who appear to have been lost in the fire at Marysville is Dr Ken Rowe. I knew him very well and held him in extremely high regard. His wife has arranged for a memorial service to be conducted for him in Melbourne on Tuesday morning. I understand that his motor vehicle was found adjacent to their home in Marysville, and he is presumed by his wife and those who love him to have died in the fire. Ken Rowe was the head of standards and development at the Australian Council for Educational Research, a man of emotional and intellectual depth that I have rarely encountered. When I was Minister for Education, Science and Training, I described him as ‘ Mr Common Sense’. Amongst other things, he chaired the national inquiry into literacy. He will be greatly missed by people in the educational community. The reforms in schooling and teacher training in particular which were initiated by the previous government and, to its great credit, have been taken up by the new government are in no small way informed by the work of Dr Ken Rowe. The other observation that others have made, which I would reinforce, is that it seems that those who have so little to give are the ones who have given the most. In terms of shaping us as a people, whether as individuals or as a nation, as tragic as all of this is, it is not so much what happens to us as individuals or to our country that determines our value and our worth; it is how we deal with it. What we have seen over the last week is the very best in human beings, the very best in the ideals that we have as Australians of the sort of people that we want to be. I would also make the observation, which I think was made by the member for McMillan and also some others, that we are going through an enormous period of change in our world. It is a world frequently characterised by fundamentalist intolerance, by what appears to be unprecedented global economic uncertainty and by technological change. The very graphic reminder that we have had in all of this is that, irrespective of our sophistication and technological advances, there is little at times that we can do against the fury of nature, but in all of this what we need most is one another, the resource of our personal relationships and the belief in one another and that we can support one another and face our adversities. In my own electorate of Bradfield, we, like many other Australians, live in and very close to bushland. In Hornsby, the Lane Cove National Park and the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park are bushland, and fires are a part of the community in which we live. But, unlike these communities that were affected, we are not living at the end of isolated roads. We live close to sophistication. We have had fires, particularly in 1994, which have certainly threatened homes and lives, but nothing like this. Whilst the debate continues about whether you stay or whether you go-and the royal commission and other inquiries will establish whether or not that has been the right advice-I suspect from a distance from this that it is the right advice for ordinary fires, but by all accounts this was no ordinary fire. AndI am mindful of the fact that the fires continue. On behalf of the people in my community, from Willoughby, Chatswood, Pymble, Gordon, Roseville, St Ives, Hornsby, Asquith, Waitara, Wahroonga, Warrawee and all of the communities that I am privileged to represent: there is an enormous repository of grief and goodwill for the people of Victoria. There is, I know, an enormous generosity in my community. On behalf of the people whom I represent, I send condolences-and, indeed, we will send money and other resources, as we have already begun to do-to the people of Victoria. MAIN COMMITTEE We are who we are, and we are defined and shaped in no small way by our adversities. Whether as individuals, as I said, or indeed as a nation, it is how we will deal with this. I would also like to thank all of my colleagues across both sides of the House for the way in which the parliament has been conducted this week. things that seem important, the things that we convince ourselves are important: a larger house, a bigger plasma TV, a faster car, the latest boat, another investment property, a more prestigious school for the kids. These are all tangible, material and quantifiable but never sufficient. Equally, nations and governments can be distracted by these same things, but then there are moments in one’s life, as there are moments in a nation’s history, where the haze of such distraction gives way to a moment of realisation. It is that moment when you look at your wife, your children, your parents or your brothers and sisters and you know that you would do everything in your power to protect them. That moment of realisation came for most people across this nation as we looked on at the devastation wrought by the bushfires that have claimed the lives and property of so many Victorians. Kinglake, St Andrews, Humevale, Strathewen, Flowerdale, Marysville, Steels Creek, Callignee-last week these were names to be found on maps of places that many of us have never visited. Today these are the names of communities that the nation has embraced in mourning. Images of the scarred, almost wintry landscapes, of the anguish on people’s faces, will be forever etched in our memories. As the survivors walk through the burnt out shells of their family homes, or drive along roads lined with charcoal-black tree stumps and smouldering wrecks of cars, they must now contemplate the task of rebuilding their lives. For each of these people, there is a sense of loss so deep and profound that I cannot begin to imagine how they are feeling. More chilling is the montage of faces of the victims of this calamity: a beautiful young girl with a vivacious smile-someone’s daughter; a middle-aged man with the creases on his face that come from a life of hard work-someone’s husband and father; an elderly woman with a gentle smile-someone’s mother and grandmother. These faces remind us of the arbitrary nature of the death and destruction meted out by these fires. We look at these faces and we reflect upon how lucky we are and how much we have to be thankful for. It is trite but true to say that we do not appreciate what we have until it is lost, or at least under threat. At the moment the number of deaths from the Victorian bushfires stands at 181, with an unfortunate expectation that this number will be revised upwards. There are at least 20 people who have been admitted to hospital with serious burns and 570 people who have sustained injuries. Of course, we should not forget that some of these fires continue to rage. I live in a region susceptible to the ravages of bushfire, on the western outskirts of Sydney at the foot of the Blue Mountains World Heritage area. My community knows only too well how vulnerable we all are to such a disaster. On behalf of my local community, I say to the people and families who have been affected by these fires, losing their property or their loved ones, that you are in our thoughts and our prayers. For the majority of the nation there is a sense of helplessness as we can only watch the devastation unfold from a distance. For us here in parliament, we have an obligation to articulate and convey the heartfelt sympathy and solidarity that our respective communities have for the people of Victoria and to help to rally the support of our communities in helping to MAIN COMMITTEE",234,Condolences
238,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay) (10.44 Am),"We can sometimes become distracted by therebuild those villages and towns shattered by the bushfires. Not all of us can be there fighting the fires or providing the community services and trauma counselling at the front line, but I know there are many individuals from my community donating money, blood, toys and clothes to try and give our fellow countrymen and countrywomen in Victoria a helping hand. I urge all Australians to make a contribution to our national effort to confront this crisis and rebuild the lives and communities of those affected by these fires. I think it speaks to the character of the Australian people that in times of need we are able to put aside our differences and the distractions of our day-to-day concerns and roll up our sleeves and pitch in. Even in the midst of a global economic downturn where people face the prospect of a global recession and ever-growing economic and job insecurity, there are millions of Australians digging deep into their pockets to give what they can. I understand that the Victorian Red Cross fund, established to help victims of the fires, has already received more than $50 million in contributions and that the overall national fundraising effort has already eclipsed the amount raised in response to the 2004 tsunami. These figures are set to increase after tonight’s telethon and Friday night’s charity AFL match. While the spirit of Australian mateship is on display in the actions of Australians all around this country dipping into their pockets, we are still only beginning to hear of the many acts of heroism that have been carried out by Australians at the scenes of this tragedy. There are of course many hundreds of brave men and women battling the fires head-on. Our volunteer firefighters are the real heroes of this tragedy. They were the first to don their overalls and pick up a hose, some losing their own homes while they saved the homes of others. They are an army battered and blackened and exhausted but which fights on. These heroes are everyday members of their communities who feel they have a duty to protect the homes and the lives of their friends and families, and they have been out in the heat and the wind, subjecting themselves and their families to the threat of the very loss that they are fighting so hard to prevent. I would like to place on the record my deep admiration for those men and women of the CFA and all the other emergency personnel, and I wish them well in their ongoing fight against these fires. I would also like to acknowledge the efforts of members of the New South Wales State Emergency Service and the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, who have also been sending crews down to Victoria to help their Victorian colleagues. This is a busy time for the RFS, which is also fighting fire fronts in the north and south of New South Wales, and I would particularly like to recognise the efforts of those RFS brigades from my local district who travelled to the Peats Ridge fire on the Central Coast on Saturday morning and did not leave until Sunday night. Like members of the CFA, these are everyday, local people who, as volunteers, answer the call to fight a fire at any time of the day or night and then front up for work the next morning. They kiss their families goodbye knowing full well that they may not come back. These volunteers are truly inspirational people. They have my gratitude and I know that they have the gratitude of my local community for the important and selfless work that they undertake. We hope that the herculean efforts of our firefighters will soon prevail over the remaining fires. When the haze of these fires clears and the full extent of the destruction of this disaster becomes clear, we must not allow ourselves to lose sight of the things that matter most: our families, our friends and our communities. These fires have exacted a huge damage toll, but even their awesome power cannot extinguish or suppress the indefatigable hope that lies at the MAIN COMMITTEE very core of our national spirit. Let us remember the contributions of those lost and those who have given so much to mitigate these losses. Let us honour their lives and their contributions by mustering the very best values and instincts of our people to rebuild our communities and unite the nation in the knowledge that we will not be defeated. We are a resilient people and we will weather the storms, the floods and the fires that come our way, as we will always chip in to help one of our own in need. Ms COLLINS (Franklin) (10.54 am)-This is one motion I cannot really say I am glad to speak on because it is about an appalling event that all of us wish had not happened, but it has and it still is happening. SoI am adding my voice on behalf of my constituents to all those members who have already spoken so eloquently, many of them struggling with their emotions. I congratulate my colleagues on both sides of the House for the way in which the parliament has been conducted this past week. I take particular note of the member for McMillan, whose words truly moved everybody in the chamber on that day. What a privilege it was to be there listening to his speech. As we continue to put on record our own condolences, we know the toll keeps rising. At present we have 181 deaths and hundreds injured. We know that these fires have destroyed more than 900 homes so far. We know many small towns and hamlets have been completely destroyed. What a terrible tragedy. It is truly just horrendous. Most of us will never know what it must feel like-we will never know the terror. How horrific the events of that fateful day, how people must have felt and how terrible the shock, the pain and the confusion of the days that follow. Our thoughts are with the people who have lost their loved ones and the people who are yet to find out about their nearest and dearest and are still waiting-the anguish must be unbearable. Our thoughts are also with those who have lost their homes and those who are wondering why they were lucky and spared. All the different emotions, all these different experiences, but people need to know in Victoria that Australians around the country are clearly showing that they are not alone. We care. We will do whatever it takes to assist and we will provide the support and practical assistance that they need as they rebuild their lives, their homes and their communities. Australia, while large in land, is just a small community and as so many people have been directly affected by this event, there are so many more across this nation who have some connection to this terrible tragedy-a family member, a friend, a friend of a friend-it makes it very personal for so many Victorians and Australians. As this tragedy unfolds, as the dreadful loss of lives continues to rise, we brace ourselves each day as we turn to the news and we see that more and more names have been added to those who have died. It gets worse, it gets more personal and we all begin to wonder why and how. We may never learn all the answers to the questions but we will try to find them. I commend the Victorian government for holding a royal commission into these fires. We owe it to those who have been touched and those who have died. May their losses never be in vain; may these events never be repeated. Over the past few days my electorate office in Hobart like, I am sure, many others around the country has been inundated with people dropping off donations for the victims. They are calling asking what to donate; where they can make their donation of cash. In my electorate we are also hearing from those who need to talk to somebody about this horrendous event because for many it is bringing back memories of bushfire events passed. In Tasmania, ironiMAIN COMMITTEE cally, on exactly that same day, 7 February, but in 1967, 42 years ago, many in my electorate were affected by their own terrible tragedy. The day is known in Tasmania as Black Tuesday and at that time it was the biggest loss of life from any disaster in any one day in this country. They were the most deadly bushfires that Tasmania had ever faced. They left 62 people dead, 900 injured and 7,000 homeless. There were 125 separate fire fronts that burnt through southern Tasmania. They burnt some 264,000 hectares of land in southern Tasmania, all in just five hours. The worse of these fires was the Hobart fire, which encroached upon the city and affected the people in my electorate. Fifty-two people, most from my electorate, died on that day. The property loss was extensive, with 1,293 homes and over 1,700 other buildings destroyed. The fires destroyed 80 bridges, 4,800 sections of powerlines, 1,500 motor vehicles and over 100 other structures. The destruction was absolute. It was estimated that 62,000 livestock were destroyed, and the damage that day in Tasmania amounted to $45 million. That was in 1967 Australian dollar figures. My own family was touched by these bushfires that day. The town of Snug, south of Hobart, was badly damaged, and my father’s house was completely burnt down. Unfortunately, my father died just a few years later, when I was very young, and those treasured photos are even harder to come by because of that day. But fortunately it was only one day and there was welcome rain that extinguished the flames. Of course, this natural disaster in Victoria is so much worse as it is on a much greater scale, with the worse possible factor-that is, the number of lives that have been lost. We know from our experience in Tasmania that the effects of such devastation last not just days and weeks but years and decades as people deal with the impact, the memories of those they have lost and the memories and the ongoing injuries, both physical and mental, of those who survive. We know that many people around Australia, particularly young children, will be traumatised by the vision and the photos of this terrible event-there are so many lives, so many people, so much to grieve for. It is truly important that we continue to provide support for those affected in these days and the weeks, the months and the years ahead. These scars will last a lifetime. But as this nation deals with this awful of event we have also seen great generosity and that great Australian spirit shine through. Many parallels can be drawn from Australia’s natural disasters, for one consistent theme is the generosity of Australians. The amount of money being donated is just phenomenal, and we have heard today that it is over $50 million. Each and every person is thinking, ‘What can I do? How can I help?’ The response from people across this nation is palpable. From small communities to some of Australia’s largest cities and corporations, both young and old want to help. I have heard of young children emptying their piggy banks and taking them and donating them to those who need it most. I have heard of others donating large sums of money that they really cannot afford but are thinking, ‘I’m much better off than those who have nothing.’ This amazing generosity warms my heart. As I have mentioned, at a local level there have been heart-warming gestures from people who want to assist where they can. At five o’clock yesterday afternoon my electorate office was inundated with clothing, toiletries, toys for children and many kind words. You literally cannot move. You can see from the photos that the boxes are up this high. I thank each and every one of my constituents who thought about someone else’s situation and who selflessly gave to ease a stranger’s burden. One constituent, a retired builder from Lauderdale, wanted to offer his services to help rebuild the homes that have been lost in the fire. Another example MAIN COMMITTEE of generosity is that of a resident who has offered up his home for accommodation for those who have lost their own homes. I would also like to single out a special volunteer organisation that has helped many Australians over the past four decades with both financial and moral support through times of natural disaster. The Snug District Disaster Appeal Committee was formed after the ‘67 bushfires in Tasmania, and 42 years on they are still helping Australians who have been confronted by extraordinary circumstances. In 1967, the residents of Snug felt the wave of support and generosity from those across the country, and this support helped them through their dark times. So in 1968, the small community wanted to repay this generosity after experiencing their own adversity. They vowed to help any future victims of natural disasters in Australiaand that is just what they are doing today in Snug. Phyl Norton is President of the Snug District Disaster Appeal Committee, and she speaks with some experience when it comes to surviving devastating bushfire. Her message to those in Victoria is simple. She said, ‘You grow by coping and you learn the value of the people.’ It seems that this natural disaster has touched many of us in a way that is unprecedented. Those who have lost so much over the past few days should be reassured that they have the support of a nation well and truly behind them. Two days ago, a Tasmanian multiagency task force made the trip across Bass Strait to help fight the fires that still burned out of control. I was on the plane early Monday morning with many of these people. They all wanted to help. I was told there was no shortage of people willing to volunteer to go to Victoria. Whether they be career firefighters or volunteer firefighters, they all want to help. A total of 93 experienced forest fire fighters, in particular, from Tasmania have joined many others from across the nation. They have now been dispatched north-east of Melbourne to work on two major fires. Tasmania’s fire management agencies have also transported light tankers and support vehicles. They were delivered across Bass Strait on the Spirit of Tasmania. I want to place on record my appreciation of the efforts of all the fire men and women and all the defence and emergency services personnel who have done great deeds over the past few days and who are stilling working to protect lives and property as we speak. For we know the danger is not over. We thank them. AndI thank the many volunteers and community organisations who are on the ground delivering assistance to those who need it. Many of them have been touched themselves, and yet they are out there helping others. Finally, on behalf of the communities and the good people of Franklin, I extend my heartfelt condolences to all those affected. My empathy goes to those who are grieving and my best wishes go to those still fighting the fires. May they stay safe. My hopes, prayers and thoughts are with Victorians as they deal with the enormity of this disaster. my colleague from Tasmania, the member for Franklin. You have touched our hearts. I know that this catastrophe has brought back memories to you, and I think that by sharing those with us and the nation we better appreciate what this means. It is not just about the now; it is certainly about the future as well. I congratulate you and thank you for sharing that with us. It is a strange coincidence that I was once a member of the Franklin community. On7 February 1967, on Black Tuesday in Tasmania, I was in high school and I was a member of my MAIN COMMITTEE",238,Condolences
239,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (11.07 Am),"I acknowledge the most moving speech oflocal Scout group. I was let out of school and I went to help fight the fires on Risdon Hill, near Warrane. I was young, and I did not fully appreciate the extent of what was happeninguntil later, of course. The fear and the terror that is associated with a raging bushfire came to me personally as, unfortunately, I wandered away from a group that I was helping to fight the fire, and I was left behind. As I made my way out, I remember the fear and the horror, and fortunately they came back and got me. I remember going to the top of Tranmere Hill, and I looked over the beautiful valley of Rokeby, which is deep in the electorate of Franklin. I saw a car driving along Rokeby Road, and I saw the fire pass it-it was that fast. As I say, I was young and I did not understand the extent and the technicalities involved in that fire, but the desolation was enormous, the loss of life was enormous, and the scars and the memories still live on. You have reminded us of that. So, in the light of my boyhood experience, I can only just begin to understand, to try and appreciate what has happened in Victoria. I want to speak on behalf of the people of my electorate on the north-west coast of Tassie, the west coast and King Island. Like all members in this House, as the member for Franklin reminded us, we have been inundated with phone calls and materials to try and do something in our own small way, to try to support in not just a physical sense but also an emotional sense the people of Victoria who have been so seriously affected by this. What on earth can you do but say, ‘We’re with you’? We have been overwhelmed, like most members in this House, and in fact we cannot get into our office now. There are not enough containers on the wharf at the moment to get the gear out of Tassie. So we are trying to find big containers-not boxes, but shipping containers. We are very grateful to all those people involved in the logistical movement of goods across the strait for their support. We had about 600 bags of donated goods in our office and we are begging people now to please consider donating toiletries, money and blood. So it is ironic, and in a sense pretty apt, that we share the one blood, and they are going to need it into the future. I want to place on the record our sincere condolences from the communities that I am proud to represent, and from my family and my staff as well. Again, we can only just begin to appreciate what it means to these families. I remember hearing the words from John Forrest, the member for Mallee, whom I share a committee with. With his engineering expertise he was demonstrating to us, amongst the sadness, his description of what happens in a normal bushfire and then his assessment of what was happening in this one. It was absolutely frightening but he did make an extraordinary statement, which was reiterated by the member for MacMillan in his very moving speech, saying that the Australian dream for so many can only happen and can only take place in an environment that has to have fire and that is the continent we live in and we have to share this continent. We as a civilisation and as a people have to come to terms with that. I can make no judgment at this time-nor can any of us, and nor should we-about how and why this happened as it did, but we have to do something if we are going to live amongst it and we have to learn to cope with it. This seems to have been a most extraordinary situation that has led to this destruction and decimation. So we feel for all those people in Victoria who have been affected by thisindeed, it is very much the whole state. Australia is a small place, as one of our colleagues pointed out, we all know someone who has been involved. The member for Franklin pointed out that firefighting crews from Tasmania, particularly from her area and mine, are well MAIN COMMITTEE skilled in trying to fight fires, as they are throughout most of Australia, and have all descended with their expertise and goodwill into Victoria. We wish them well. We thank all those employers, who are members of the community, for their goodwill and generosity towards those people who have volunteered their services. We expect those who can help in any way possible-whether they be institutions, agencies or whatever-to do the right thing by these people affected because, after all, the economy and our agencies exist for people, and we need to remember that. In the email that was forwarded to all members in this House by a Mr Steve Lewis, an engine driver from New South Wales, he said that he did not know how to express what he felt as an Australian and as an individual about the tragedy in Victoria, and he made the comment that he was proud of this parliament and how we have conducted ourselves. I have to sayand we tend to forget this-that this parliament is full of people who represent communities. Listening to our colleagues in this House talk about their communities, I felt so proud of them because they know their communities. That is why they are there. They did what they do best: they really represented them. I honour them and I thank them. But I did think, when I read the email from Mr Lewis, that he eloquently explained what he meant and felt, and he could have done it in this place, because he too belongs to a community, and when our community needs us we all rise to that occasion. If this has done anything apart from sharing the terrible loss, it has brought us together. We do have a spirit in this country which is very giving and which is very willing, and I am very proud to be part of that. So, on behalf of the people of Braddon, in the north-west of Tassie: my heartfelt condolences to all those who have been affected and touched by these terrible, terrible fires. We give a commitment along with this parliament that we will not forget about it in two weeks or three weeks time. We have got to do our bit. We know what it is like in Tassie. We are there for the long haul not just the short haul. To all those affected by this: I wish you well into the future. Ms McKEW (Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare) (11.16 am)-It is not my intention to take up much of the Committee’s time, but I do want to join my parliamentary colleagues in recording my sorrow and my solidarity with those many thousands of families in Victoria whose lives have been so bitterly transformed by the most destructive natural disaster in our history. Like many others, we watch each news bulletin, each newspaper edition, and the tragedy deepens. This morning on the front page of the Daily Telegraph there was that stark number: 300. Each day we consider the stories, the detail. I think the sorrow is in the detail: the excruciating way that so many faced their last minutes, how mothers attempted to protect their children, to save animals, to do anything to survive, and the selflessness of those who moved heaven and earth to save the lives and property of others. For so many-too many-it has been an experience that brings us back to primal basics. How many would have offered up a final prayer: ‘Just let me live. Let my family survive.’ I sense that there is a shocked stillness across the country this week. You can certainly feel it here in the nation’s parliament, and elsewhere, as we all try to absorb what has happened. That is an almost impossible task. As we look at those photos of families, of young children, of grandparents in happier times, we think of lives cut short by a brutal act of nature. Three MAIN COMMITTEE schools have burnt to the ground, teachers have been lost, and there is the news today that one of the country’s most respected educational researchers, Dr Ken Rowe, is missing. Children are resilient, but many will never forget the playmate they have lost. For some who have survived but lost a partner, friends or neighbours, along with property and muchloved animals, there will be a life, but it will be a deeply altered life. This is hard to say, but I think for some it will be contemptible to hear the oft repeated phrase, ‘It’s time for the healing to begin.’ This is a banal sentiment, and it misunderstands the nature of unbearable loss. No parent or grandparent ever truly recovers from the death of a young child. As the poet Wordsworth said, albeit in a different context, there are ‘thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears’. I know, as well, that we all feel so much for the professionals, the police, the victim identification teams and the others who now have the hard task of minutely combing through the destruction to look for bodies. What shocking sights they must confront. They are trained for this, of course, but how many of them must be asking: how could this happen? How could so many die such gruesome deaths? This numbs us. The scale of it seems too much. But alongside this, as so many of my colleagues in this House have remarked this week, we are a practical people. We are responsive and we have a lot of grit. I have felt immensely proud to be a member of this parliament this week as we have all said in unison that we will do whatever it takes to rebuild those communities in Victoria. I would also like to record the generosity of many thousands of people in my own community of Bennelong, in the north-west of Sydney, who are giving money, sending clothes and donating blood. I would like to thank the many businesses who have made large donations and to record in particular the comments from the manager of the North Epping branch of the Bendigo Community Bank, Sharyn Hubert. The bank plays a marvellous role in my community, promoting social capital and community partnerships, so it was not surprising to hear Sharyn say this week that the bank had been flat out. She told my office that one lady came into the bank the other day in tears. She was an artist and had spent a lot of time in some of the affected areas of Victoria, and she said: ‘I can’t afford much, but this is all I have to give.’ Another local resident came in yesterday and donated $5,000-just one individual. I would also like to put on record my thanks to the Child Care Centres Association of Victoria for their offer of help in wanting to restore a level of normalcy to the lives of children as quickly as possible. The CAA have been working to identify vacancies in suburbs and county areas to help with families who may have relocated. Equally, at an institutional level, I am very pleased to see the fast and flexible response of the National Childcare Accreditation Council. They are moving on a range of initiatives-phoning validators and moderators to see if they are safe and checking various services. Finally, as someone who has spent most of my professional life working for the national broadcaster, it has been so heartening to hear so many of my colleagues commend the unique role of the ABC, and ABC Radio in particular. Just think about this: here we are in the 21st century, talking about digital platforms and the vast reach of the internet, but at a time of crisis all you need to stay connected to the outside world is a battery charged $10 transistor tuned to your local ABC. It is old technology, but what a lifeline it is. What a treasure. I am sure Managing Director Mark Scott has taken note. I support the motion. MAIN COMMITTEE Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister for Youth and Minister for Sport) (11.23 am)-I rise to also support this motion and extend my own deep condolences to all of those that have been affected by these terrible fires. I rise to acknowledge all of those we have lost, all of those who are now suffering and all of those who have so tragically lost their lives. To be perfectly honest, despite all of the television footage, the newspaper articles and the photographs, I still cannot truly imagine it. I cannot imagine the panic. I cannot imagine the confusion. Do we go? Do we stay? I cannot imagine the fear of waiting and being completely helpless. In some cases I still get goose bumps thinking that so many of my fellow Australians have gone through this in recent days. I rise today to say to them: I am sorry. I am so sorry that good Australian families-mums, dads and kids-had to go through these terrible times. I say this on behalf of the people of Adelaide, who I am privileged enough to represent in this place and who, like all of us, have been touched. Like so many, they have dug deep and donated. They have gone out of their way to offer whatever it is that they can do to help, to be of some assistance during this time, and I thank the good people of Adelaide for those efforts as well. Many speakers before me have expressed the horror far more eloquently than I will even attempt to do of what has happened in recent days and I commend all of those speakers to the House. Like those who have spoken before me, I think it is something that can really unite this parliament and it has been a good thing to see everybody standing together. As members of this parliament we are saying to all of those suffering that we will support them however we can and that we will be there with them to undertake the very tough task of rebuilding these communities. We have also heard many stories of Australian heroes over the last few days, whether it be the amazing volunteers in the CFA who put themselves in harm’s way and often sacrificed much in their own lives in order to go out there and do what they could to protect others, whether it be the role that the police have played or whether it be all of those who, even now, have the darkest of tasks of going in to those communities in the victim recovery units. There are all of those in the Red Cross who are working so very hard and who sprang into action without having to be asked twice. There are the heroic community members, who we have read stories about, who have stepped up to help each other, to help their neighbours and to do what they can. There are the strong family members who are now having to be there to support others through this incredibly tough emotional time and there are the kind strangers, those people who have stepped up to help people whom they have never met but who are members of their communities and who they want to help. This has reiterated for me that in times of hardship Australians stand up. That is something tremendous about our character. There are thousands of stories that have already emerged about different groups of Australians standing up and doing what they can. It is not my intention to outline all of these to the House but I did want to talk about one particular area. It is often said that sport holds a special place in our national identity and we talk about being a sports mad country. Some people focus on it and, I know, deride sport saying it is all just a game, just a bit of fun, that people look at perhaps on weekends. WhatI want to outline and show some examples of is that sportspeople have been standing up and sending a very clear message that they want to be an important part of this community and to do what they can in times of hardship and tragedy. We have seen several examples of that in recent days. MAIN COMMITTEE In my home town of Adelaide, just a couple of days ago, we saw Cricket Australia raise a staggering $6 million in one cricket match to go towards supporting the Red Cross Bushfire Appeal. There was the moving image of the Australian and New Zealand players heads bowed in a minute of absolute silence. It is not often you get silence on the hill at Adelaide Oval, but the whole community stood in solidarity and it moved us all. Then there was the $6 million raised from the players donating their match fees, from the money from everyone who attended the game and paid for the car park which was donated towards this appeal, and from the people who went around with buckets at the time. Over $6 million raised is truly staggering and a fine contribution. We have seen the Football Federation of Australia donate $100,000 to the appeal and it will provide replacement football equipment to the schools and to the junior football clubs when needed. Last night we saw the Socceroos take on Japan in their World Cup qualifying match wearing their black armbands but also showing their international solidarity with buckets going through the Japanese crowd raising money for the bushfire appeal to help to rebuild. In addition, the Football Federation has put in place arrangements to raise money and show respect at the A League semifinals this weekend. The AFL has also stepped up. They have moved the first blockbuster of the season between Essendon and the Western Bulldogs on Friday night to the Telstra Dome. It is expected that ticket sales will also raise over $1 million with other measures to follow. There are many other examples. In rugby league, the NRL and the ARL are providing an initial $100,000 upfront as well as providing $70,000 in partnerships with Lifeline and the Melbourne Royal Children’s Hospital burns unit. The Australian Olympic Committee has pledged $100,000, with countless sports and teams across the country willing to step up. I should also say that, with the cricket team, it was not just that they managed to raise $6 million in a night; Ricky Ponting and the boys also were adamant that they wanted to travel up to the bushfire affected area and go out there to show their support and do what they could to support the local communities. I think that in times of tragedy, in times when there is no one thing that can be done to make things right or to set things back on the right path, sometimes having our national heroes, those people that we look up to in different fields, come up and put themselves out of their way to show that they are there to support local communities is incredibly important. From golf, Craig Parry and Nick O’Hearn will each donate $200,000, which will come from the annual charity event in the US. I know that women’s golf is also expressing support, with money for every birdie and money from a number of different events going forward. They are lucky I am not playing, because that would not be particularly helpful! The V8 Supercars have donated $100,000, and there are many, many other examples. Netball Australia has committed to fundraising. The Australian Rugby Union will be coordinating efforts at future Super 14 games. Basketball Australia has donated $10,000 and will be paying respects at upcoming games. Hockey Australia took up a collection at the Kookaburras match. Bowls Australia will be using their marquee bowling event to support the appeal. Equestrian Australia are collecting donations and coordinating practical assistance for the horse owners who need support at this difficult time. Rowing Australia are collecting donations. Gymnastics Australia, Tennis Australia and Motorcycling Australia are all developing ways in which they too can assist. MAIN COMMITTEE This support is not limited to just the national sporting organisations. Individual teams and individual players are stepping up right around Australia to say, ‘We want to do what we can to help in this terrible time’-the Perth Wildcats, the Richmond Football Club, the Melbourne Storm, the Brisbane Broncos, the Newcastle Knights, the Wests Tigers, the Gold Coast Titans and the Canberra Raiders have all stepped forward and made remarkable efforts. I am sure that there are many, many more that I have left off this list. This generosity of sport continues at the grassroots level. Particularly for the children who have gone through these recent times, we want to return some element of normality to their lives just as soon as we can. That is going to take a long time and it is going to take big efforts, but it may be helped by something like a local sporting club donating some equipment so that they can go out and play, so that they can just have a little bit of being children and doing what comes naturally. We know that no one sector or organisation can make this all go away, as much as I am sure we all wish it would. But we also know that in times of sorrow and in times of national tragedy there are heroes right across Australia who stand up. There are countless heroes across Australia today, as there will be tomorrow and in the days that follow. In standing to place on the record my deep sympathies and condolences for all of those affected by those fires, I also say thank you to Australian sport for standing up when we need you. Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (11.33 am)-I rise to support the condolence motion moved by the Deputy Prime Minister in this House and to extend, on behalf of my community, our deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones of the Australians killed in the weekend’s tragic bushfires. I also want to record our deep regret at the human injury, the loss of property and the destruction of communities caused by those fires. I particularly want to praise the work of emergency services-the volunteers and community members who are out there assisting friends, colleagues, neighbours and, as the minister indicated, even strangers in this time of need. I also want to acknowledge the profound impact on those communities affected and the role the government can take with the Australian community in assisting that recovery and rebuilding. I agonised for a while about whether I would participate in this condolence motion debate. The reason I did was because I just could not imagine what I could put on the record to add to the words of the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and, most significantly, those members representing Victorian seats whose communities were directly affected by what happened. It was very difficult for me to consider what I would say. I come from a community that is, on occasion, touched by fire, as every community in Australia is. I come from a community that has dealt with its own disasters since the early days of its inception, and, at this moment, I want to acknowledge that the local people in my area have put together a tremendous effort to stand beside their friends, colleagues and countrymen in Victoria. I think they do that because we come from a place where we have experienced disaster, particularly in the mining industry. In the very early days, we lost 81 men in the Bulli Colliery gas explosion in 1887. We lost 96 men and boys, some as young as 14 and 15, in the Mount Kembla Colliery explosion in 1902. We lost 14 miners at the Appin mine explosion in 1979. The reason I hesitate to speak on motions like this is that I was 17 at the time of the 1979 explosion and living on the Appin mine site-my father was the electrical engineer in chargeMAIN COMMITTEE when it occurred. The night of the disaster, we were at a school dance and driving home the son of one of the miners killed. I am profoundly aware of how, as a community, you rarely raise your eyes beyond those immediate to you and your concerns for them in the early days of something like that. There is a level of bemusement about what is going on beyond the immediate challenges that you face. But I also know how profoundly important are the messages of support, the physical efforts of your countrymen around Australia in saying that they want to not only offer comfort, but also physical support in the difficult days you face after something like that. The size of this fire disaster is incomprehensible and many in here have expressed their absolute commitment to working through not only these difficult initial days but also the longer term. SoI decided I would speak and that I would speak on behalf of my community, just to report to the people of Victoria the efforts that are going on in Wollongong to provide that support to them. In the days since the original motion, the list has been constantly added to, so I will work through it as quickly as I can. I want to acknowledge that I know we are not unique in this; I know the communities of every member of this parliament are out there doing exactly the same thing. That is what makes us a tremendous nation. I want to acknowledge i98, one of the local radio stations. Marty and Erica have a bushfire appeal going. They write on their website: The people of Wollongong have responded INCREDIBLY-as always-we are just blown away. On Monday Feb 16 at 8 am Marty and myselfthis is Erica speakingMatthew Murrell… and John Noble… will leave Wollongong for Victoria, and the central warehouse of the Salvos Stores in Melbourne. We will then be broadcasting live from either Bendigo or Traralgon on Tuesday morning, before making our way back to Wollongong. They are urging listeners to gather up: … unwanted or unused clothing, toys, kitchenware, toiletries, linen, furniture, electrical & white goods and other household itemsand they have some businesses that are offering their assistance. Murrells Freight in Port Kembla, MJ Rowles locations around the Illawarra, Wollongong Mini Storage and South Coast Hire are all chipping in to help with that particular concern. All of my local media-the WIN TV reporters, the Illawarra Mercury, ABC radio and both of the commercial radio stations-are advertising to people on how to donate, and I think that is particularly important. Our other radio station, 96.5 Wave FM, have a bushfire appeal on as well. Their website says: Greg, Dave and Jade from WAVE FM’s Bigger Breakfast have pledged to stay on air non-stop for 50 They are asking people to call in during this 50-hour marathon bushfire appeal and make donations. They are also urging people to lodge donations through the Red Cross website. They list some local businesses that are also assisting, and I want to let people know who is participating. The Caltex service stations at Unanderra and Albion Park will donate 1c from every litre of petrol sold during the 50-hour appeal. You can have your car washed at Bonnet to Boot and they will donate all the proceeds to the appeal. Laura Dean Financial Solutions will donate $25 to the appeal for every couple who attends their mortgage seminar. Tony from MAIN COMMITTEE Gold City Jewellers in Westfield Figtree is donating 10 per cent of the proceeds from every purchase made during the 50-hour appeal. Michael from All Care Computers will donate $10 per job booked during the marathon. Em Gees Hair Design in Oak Flats are donating $1 from every service. Voluptuous Ladies on George Street, Warilla will give 20 per cent of all their sales and 10 per cent for every handbag they sell to the appeal. Network Video in Dapto will be donating all their takings to the appeal. That is a tremendous effort from a wide variety of local businesses. A lot of churches and community groups are getting on board and doing what they can. The Catholic Bishop of Wollongong, Peter Ingham, is working with Catholic bishops from Melbourne, Ballarat, Bendigo and Sale to see what the dioceses in Wollongong can do to assist down there. I am sure they will appreciate that, because he is a lovely gentleman and a wonderful local person. Of course, he is sending his prayers to those affected by the bushfires and encouraging tax deductible donations through the Catholic Archbishops Charitable Fund Bushfire Appeal or the St Vincent de Paul Society. The Wollongong City Council are encouraging staff to donate and they will match those donations. They are also allowing staff time off to go and give blood-another very sensible, practical initiative to help out. Other councils in my region are doing similar things. There was a New South Wales Electrical Trades Union biennial conference held in Wollongong this week. They passed the bucket around to delegates and raised $25,000. ETU Secretary, Bernie Riordan, indicated that eight of their members had lost everything in the fires while another two had been hospitalised with serious burns. The membership at that conference were very keen to provide support. The Figtree Anglican Church is holding a memorial service in remembrance of the victims. The senior minister, Reverend Ian Barnett, said that the service will provide an opportunity for people, regardless of their religious denomination, to reflect and pray. The church is in the process of establishing partnerships with some of the towns and local churches to provide assistance. David De Santi and Russell Hannah from the Illawarra Folk Club are organising a bush dance and concert for the appeal at which performers are donating their services. The cost of entry, $10 for adults and $5 for children, will go to the appeal. The University of Wollongong staff and students are having a bushfire relief cricket match. They make no guarantees about the quality of the cricket, but they are sure that they will get lots of support from those at the campus coming along and making donations. Congratulations to Toby Kell, Nick Rouen and Clinton Mead for organising that. BlueScope Steel, one of our big local employers, have announced today that they are donating $1 million in steel products and building solutions to help rebuild communities, which is a tremendous initiative on their behalf. My commendations go to them. BlueScope Steel’s Managing Director and CEO, Paul O’Malley, said that the company was also encouraging its 20,000 employees worldwide to donate to the Red Cross Victorian Bushfire Appeal. I have been advised that 19 South Coast clubs have to date pledged $60,000 on behalf of members, complementing a Clubs NSW appeal. The Australian Workers Union Port Kembla branch secretary, Andy Gillespie, reports that they have donated $10,000 to the appeal. They are encouraging other unions, companies and employment groups to do likewise. He said, ‘We can’t bring people back, but hopefully we can help rebuild people’s lives.’ MAIN COMMITTEE Today in the Illawarra Mercury there is a photo representing all those different groups. I also acknowledge the many students passing buckets around at schools today and over the week as well as our very important volunteer organisations like the Salvos and St Vinnies and so forth, who are doing what they can. I hope that we can continue in our efforts to convey our words of support to the people of Victoria and, more importantly, to reflect to them the views of our community, and our love, our concern, our support and our determination to do what we can to assist them in these very difficult times. I commend the condolence motion to the Committee. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (11.45 am)-I wish to join my parliamentary colleagues in expressing my sympathy and sorrow and to extend solidarity and support for the people, families and communities suffering as a result of the horrific Victorian bushfires. I do so in my own name and for all the people in Page, the area that I represent, who have been touched deeply by this terrible tragedy. When I listened the other day to the member for McMillan as he spoke on the tragedy that is happening in Victoria, I felt that he spoke so elegantly. I felt that he spoke for all of us. This week, parliament is a different place, as is our whole nation. We are subdued. Things that have seemed urgent and important have been relegated to a different order of priority. DareI say it, we have been nicer to each other, realising the fragility of life. People are grieving, and grief is a very individual thing. People must be allowed to grieve in their time and in their way. We can simply support those who are still facing the bushfire crisis-the crisis is still there. We can support those who are into the recovery and reconstruction phasereconstructing their communities and their lives. In the face of mass atrocity, it is never quite possible to go back to what was, but it is possible to recreate that sense of community that people are feeling they have lost at the moment. These wildfires have touched all communities across Australia. A local member of my community has tragically lost three family members, and I express my deepest sympathy to him. My electorate of Page in the Northern Rivers has responded wonderfully with donations of cash, blood and goods. Our local firefighters have also gone down to Victoria. As a community, all of us have a need to give in the face of these tragedies and a need to act in the face of helplessness. We are giving generously right across Australia. I say thank you to all those who are helping, to all the wonderful volunteers and to all the wonderful Aussies. It makes me feel proud to be an Aussie at a time like this, just seeing how we respond. Our local volunteers just get in-they do not say anything; they roll up their sleeves and get on with the job. I pledge my solidarity and support for the long haul to the people whose lives have been directly and indirectly impacted. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (11.48 am)-I join with my colleagues in sharing the grief of the many Australians who have lost family, neighbours and loved ones in this tragedy, which has unfolded over the last week in Victoria. I, like all of us, watched with shock and horror as the events unfolded and as the number of deaths rose. I remember waking on Sunday morning to hear of 15 dead. It seemed that, between the news broadcasts, the numbers rose very quickly. While we look now at an official death toll of 181, we know that those numbers will rise in coming weeks and perhaps even months. Australia is, as we all know, an extraordinary country. While perhaps our newer Australians do not fully recognise our connection to the land in the way that our Indigenous Australians MAIN COMMITTEE do, the land is very much in us. I, like many of us, love our land. I love its ruggedness. I love our sun ravaged landscape. I love the eucalypt forest-the smell of it and the look of it. I love those jagged trees. They are an incredibly beautiful aspect of the landscape and they are now part of the Australian psyche. But it seems that, every 40 years or so, mother nature reminds us just how small we are on the face of this land-which of course is tens of thousands of years old-and reminds us that, no matter how we aim to tame this land, we never really will. This land-the size of it, the age of it and the power of it-will at times overwhelm us, as it has done in the preceding week. That does not make it any less painful; perhaps it makes it more so. As we seek to live in and enjoy the wonders of this land, we should remember it can be taken from us at any time. As we count the rising costs, there are many who are already pointing the finger. I deliberately do not want to do that today. In fact, I deliberately wanted to say that it is not the time for that. It is not the time for looking at who got it right and who got it wrong. It is well and truly a time for us to pull together and work in the interests of those who have so much to recover. There is so much repairing to be done in those fractured communities. I, like all my colleagues, encourage all Australians not to forget quickly how much work we have to do. At the moment we are all pulling together. Extraordinary donations are being made. There is a queue to give blood at the Red Cross. Australia is very good at pulling together at times like this. The need for blood will go on for several months because burns victims require substantial amounts of blood. So the need for us to support victims and keep this tragedy in our minds will go on for several months. In four weeks time, eight weeks time and 12 weeks time we must reflect on how well Australia has responded in the short term, and I encourage us all to continue that response in the long term. I commend the motion to the House. Ms CAMPBELL (Bass) (11.52 am)-Much has been said in this House about the tragedy which unfolded in Victoria earlier this month, and I rise to add my voice to the condolence motion. The sheer scale and horror of the tragedy are beyond comprehension for most of us and beyond words for all of us. To those who have lost loved ones-be they family, friends, neighbours or workmates-I offer my deepest condolences. The people of this great nation and, in particular, the people of Bass are with you. To those who escaped the horror but lost their homes, farms, property and stock, we will help you rebuild. To those who are injured and, in some instances, fighting for their lives, you are in our collective prayers. I do not pretend to understand what it is like to be left with nothing but the clothes in which you are standing. All we can do is offer our support-practical and emotional-and that is what we are doing. When the Deputy Prime Minister addressed the House as the scale of the destruction was becoming known and understood, she said: Just as the strength of our communities ensured many survived these very devastating events, it will be that strength and that resilience of the Australian community that will help our fellow citizens rebuild. I have witnessed first hand how true that is. Though separated by Bass Strait, Tasmania is one with Victoria. The community of Northern Tasmania has opened its collective heart, home and wallet to those Victorians left devastated by these blazes-which, it should be remembered, continue to burn. Lin Thorp and Heather Butler, from the Tasmanian government, swung into action, and parliamentarians from both sides of the political sphere opened their offices and MAIN COMMITTEE offered their staff to assist in any way possible. What followed overwhelmed and humbled me. My office, just one of many political offices in Launceston, was in the end overflowing with donations. My staff tell me of receiving phone call after phone call from people pledging what they could and apologising that they could not give more. Car after car pulled up out the front and unloaded. Children gave toys for those children who were left with nothing. One little girl somewhat reluctantly let go of a large pink gorilla. I only wish I could be there to see the expression on the face of the child who receives it. There is something truly wonderful about being an Australian. We are a diverse people and there is really no such thing as a typical Australian. Having said that, the generosity and the response to the bushfire crisis truly is typically Australian. We are a people who, when the chips are down, pull together. Our capacity to embrace our neighbours, workmates, friends, family and complete strangers is what makes this the great nation that it is. The people of Northern Tasmania gave more than simply clothes and household items. Radio station LA FM launched an appeal for cash donations. Six hours after it began, almost $100,000 had been raised. Such is the generosity of northern Tasmanians. That figure is now close to $135,000. It is testimony to the sheer passion of Mel Hope, Greg Allan and Lee Dixon. My office was contacted by local builder Ross Clark. Rather than just donating, which his wife had already done, Mr Clark wanted to help rebuild. He had the capacity to pull together plumbers, electricians and fellow builders and head north to help with the initial relief effort. That level of commitment to our fellow Australians is absolutely outstanding. So great was the response to the plea for clothes and household items that, as I said, my office was full to overflowing. My staff rang local removals and shipping companies, asking for boxes to be donated so that the assembled army of volunteers could sort through the piles of donations and box and label them. Not one of them said no-Ridgeway, Watkins, Grace and Atkins all came through with storage boxes. Not one of those who were contacted hesitated. Each and every one asked what more they could do. This is such typically Australian behaviour. To each of those companies I say thank you. The ladies at NoniB pulled together brand-new clothes and offered storage space. I thank them also. Neil Pitt’s Menswear brought around brand-new clothes. Next door to my office is Cleo Bagland, from which we received boxes and jumpers-such generosity. A woman named Karen and her two sons were visiting from Victoria. They called into my office and worked tirelessly all day sorting and packing donations. So too did Michele Savill and Judy Spear, two lovely ladies from the West Tamar Council, volunteer their time to pack and sort. Gordon Pope worked all day and was back early this morning to continue the effort. Leigh Stevenson, Lance Coral and Greg Cooper worked and worked and worked. To each of them. I say thank you. This is the kind of response that this unparalleled disaster has brought out in communities across Northern Tasmania and throughout the country. There is a cliche for which I make no apologies: I am proud to be an Australian. I am proud to stand in this place representing Australians who have dug deep over the last few days. Yes, there have been tears shed-many of them my own. My staff have leaned on each other for support when there was nothing else to do except stand in bewilderment, shake their heads and ask over and over again: ‘How?’ To the men and women of Victoria, we stand with you. From Bass in Tasmania, to the far reaches of this great country, we are with you. I echo the Prime Minister’s sentiments: we will MAIN COMMITTEE stay with you as long as it takes. To the Tasmanian firefighters who did not hesitate to make the flight north, thank you and godspeed. Forestry Tasmania and the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania have offered support and the expertise of contractors. I say thank you to them also. The Premier of Tasmania, David Bartlett, announced yesterday that the Tasmanian government would be providing up to $1 million to the Victorian Bushfire Recovery Fund. The state government will contribute $250,000 in the first instance and then match dollar for dollar, up to $1 million, the cash contributions made to the Lions, Apex and Rotary clubs. My Tasmanian parliamentary colleagues and I have collected and will make a contribution. It is the very least we can do. I thank Senator Carol Brown and Dick Adams, whose offices have coordinated the appeal. Let us not forget what has prompted this overwhelming response. The Prime Minister described it as ‘mass murder’. There is no other description for what has occurred here. As a nation, I think we accept that we live in a magnificent country but one which, nonetheless, is prone to all the extremes nature has to offer. What we cannot and should not accept is that someone would deliberately inflict this kind of suffering on communities. We ask our firefighters to protect us and they do, often risking their own lives. There are no words strong enough to condemn those who have done this. To the men and women who will for the weeks and months ahead sift through the remains of people’s lives and what have now become crime scenes, I offer my thanks. Your task is unenviable yet necessary. There have been tales of heroism emerging from the horror which continues to unfold across Victoria, and there will surely be more examples of the strength of the human spirit. As a nation, we must embrace and celebrate them. They provide support and encouragement when it is most needed. We may waver and question how much more as a nation we can take. In those dark moments we must rally, we must lean on our friends and our family, and we must be sure in the knowledge that we will go on. As a nation, we will emerge stronger and more unified from this. We will learn and apply that knowledge when once again we are confronted with nature’s fury. I join those from both sides of the House in condemning the actions of those who are responsible for this tragedy and in praising the ongoing efforts of those who continue to battle the blazes. I commend the motion to the House. members to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places.

242,Mr Robert (Fadden) (12.02 Pm),"On indulgence: it is hard to know what to make ofhomes taken in the blink of an eye, in the north 62 per cent of Queensland is under water and the parts that are not under water are in drought. I live in the seat of Fadden. It is the fastest growing electorate in the nation, as one would expect with it covering the Gold Coast. I live in the middle of the two great tempests of fire and flood that scourge our land. In my military days, I lived in the north and experienced the monsoon and all its volumes of water. We truly are a land of rugged mountain ranges, drought and flooding rains. Residents of the north prepare for the monsoon. It is part of their way of life. In military days gone by, I trained at Tully. Having parachuted into a swamp because of the metres and metres of rain-the deluge-that the place gets, I understand well how the north understands and prepares for this. But, every now and then, the heavens open up and there is a tempest and squalls greater than anyone would expect. The rivers rise, the creeks burst and the towns are flooded. And while the north prepares for the monsoon and the rains-part of the great charm of the area is that it is wet and that it has a significant wet period; that is part of what makes it a great tourism area-when the heavens explode in such a mighty way and the rivers run deep and wide and 60 per cent of Queensland floods, what becomes part of a way of life can quickly turn into horror. My thoughts go to those communities in North Queensland and parts of north Australia, including the electorate of Kennedy, who are struggling in dreadfully wet conditions and who have been cut off for weeks and weeks on end. Only now are some roads beginning to open. Families have had no fresh food for many weeks, and there has been difficulty in providing them with services and amenities due the overwhelming volume of water. While the dam wall of the Burdekin is an impressive sight at flood, that impression fades when such a degree of water spills over and impacts our communities. Like in the horrific bushfires of Victoria, there are some great heroes amongst the tragedy of this story. Those who have gone from house to house seeking to provide support need truck drivers, who are moving forward despite the deluge to provide food, clothing and essentials. There are emergency service personnel who are doing enormous hours to ensure that people are fine and well taken care of. It is fitting that we acknowledge the volume of water, the hardship and the fact that 62 per cent of the great state of Queensland is literally under water. I will finish by looking at what Ecclesiastes says in the Bible, in chapter 3. When King Solomon was reflecting on his life and all that he went through, he said: ‘There is a time for everything and a season for every activity under the sun. There is a time to be born, there is a time to plant, there is a time to weep and’-if I can paraphrase-’there will be a time to laugh. There is a time to mourn. There will be again a time to dance. It is now a time of scattering stones; there will be a time to gather them. It is a time to embrace. There will be a time to mend. There is a time to love. There is a time for peace. There is a time to heal.’ I think I can speak for all parliamentarians, as we look at what is happening with the floods in the north of Queensland, when I say: there will be a time to build and rebuild. North Queensland floods. But I need to start, on indulgence, by talking about the bushfire victims briefly because they have impacted the whole of this country in a way I do not think we have seen in the past, because it is the worse natural disaster we have experienced in this country.

I was talking to a man on the way down here on Sunday evening, and he said: ‘Give me cyclones and flooding rains any day compared to the bushfires and the scenes that we saw on television.’ The community in Cairns and the tropical Far North have opened their hearts and are donating money, and I congratulate those members of the local community who are doing that. I encourage others who have not yet done so to also open their hearts and make contributions to the bushfire appeals and also to the flood appeals. My main focus here today, though, is to talk about the floods in Far North Queensland, in the gulf, because that is the area that I represent. Honourable members might not realise, but there have been two cyclones across the north this year. We had Cyclone Charlotte on 12 January, which came across the gulf between Kowanyama and Normanton with winds of between 120 and 130 kilometres an hour, and we had Cyclone Ellie, which crossed the coast around Mission Beach on 2 February. Neither of those brought great destructive winds to local communities, but they brought flooding rains-flooding rains that have endured since early January. Effectively, as the member for Kennedy eloquently outlined in the House the other day, communities in his electorate have been cut off for long, long periods of timemost of this year. Not only communities in the gulf but, since the second cyclone, also the communities that I represent in Cairns have been cut off for extended periods of time-more than a week. Luckily, just the other day we had the roads open and trucks are again able to roll through. So there has been extensive flooding all across the north, and the statistics show that 62 per cent of the state has been declared a disaster zone. We have 36 council areas that have now been declared disasters. The damage bill will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. And the risk of flooding is not over. As people in the north know and understand, February is our wettest month of the year, and we are yet to get halfway through it, so we face in the future the potential for greater flooding and more downpours. In my own community, last Saturday night we had almost 200 millimetres of rainfall in less than an hour. I was driving home that evening from the Taipans basketball game, and it was quite amazing to have the windscreen wipers on full bore and to be flat out seeing the road in front of me. We drove very slowly, but driving in a dark night in heavy torrential rain while being able to see floodwaters poses great risks to people in my part of the world. These are some of the things that people up there put up with. They know that they need to respond to the weather appropriately. Tragically, we have lost lives in this flood. We have lost at least four lives. I think that is from people being washed off floodways. There is still a man who is yet to be found who was washed away around Tully last weekend, a young child was taken up around the Daintree and others, sadly, have been washed down stormwater drains. So we need to be prepared to make sure that we can respond to the weather conditions that we face during these difficult times. The loss of life is nothing compared to the loss of life in Victoria but, for those families and those individuals who have been impacted, the loss of life is still tragic. As I said, the Far North is being inundated with water. I was looking at the synoptic chart before coming in here. We now have a low sitting up around Bowen, and the monsoon trough is still positioned across Northern Australia. There is a real risk and threat that the floods will be back later this week, with the potential for the region again to be cut off. MAIN COMMITTEE Some of the things that obviously impact on people are houses being flooded and lives lost when people are washed away in floodwaters and the like. But one of the things that are often not seen is the impact on small businesses, whether they are farming businesses or small retailers. What happens when we have floods in the Far North is that the Bruce Highway gets cut. At Ingham it was cut for more than a week. In Cairns, the shelves on the supermarkets became empty. Coles and Woollies looked to bring goods in on barges and to fly goods in, but the shelves still became empty with the population base that we have up there. It is a major regional city. There were also farmers who could not get produce out. Pawpaws, mangoes, longans and other tropical fruits-they could not get them down south. Those farmers have a potential loss of income if that road stays closed for an extended period of time. Luckily, the road has now opened up. We have had a convoy of trucks rolling in. But we need to continue to work to upgrade the Bruce Highway. It is something that I campaigned strongly for in the lead-up to my election, and I am pleased to say that we are getting on with building a new bridge over the Mulgrave River. The works at Tully have finished early, but we need to do more around Ingham and Burdekin. The government has a $2.2 billion commitment to upgrade the Bruce Highway and a $1.1 billion commitment to upgrade the Bruce Highway between Sarina and Cairns. We need to make sure that those works continue to flow. We need to invest in and upgrade areas like the Gairloch floodway. We need to make sure we continue to work on the areas around Ingham and Innisfail in the future because the economic impacts of road closure are huge and so are the social impacts. People need to come to Townsville at times for medical purposes. What happens when the road is cut is that people cannot get through for medical purposes either. So there is not only an economic impact; there are social and community impacts from having a road closed. But I am pleased to be part of a government that is committed to infrastructure investment and is working hard to upgrade the Bruce Highway. The other thing we are in desperate need of in the Far North in Cairns is a new council disaster coordination centre. The centre as it is currently established on Anderson Street is in an area that can be flooded and that can be impacted by a tsunami, if one were to strike. We do need a new disaster centre in Cairns, in the Far North. The council has put in a submission to the new community fund established by the government last year and, as part of our stimulus package, we are hoping to add another $500 million to that. It would be a welcome commitment if delivered in my region. The centre would be an education or multipurpose centre, but in times of cyclones or other natural disasters it would act as the disaster coordination centre and the centre of relief coordination in Cairns, in the Far North. I just want to speak very briefly about some of the other things that the government has done already to respond to the flood victims. We have made available Defence Force aircraft such as Black Hawks. The Treasurer was up there on the weekend assessing the situation and determining the support that we could provide. We have airlifted in aviation fuel and the military has provided fuel drops. I spoke to the Prime Minister earlier in the week about the opportunity to use military aircraft to assist some of the farmers. I am pleased to report that he cut through the red tape. I had a commitment from him that if Emergency Management Queensland made a request to the federal government, he would look to make military aircraft available to do that. The MAIN COMMITTEE roads are open, which is good news, but the use of these aircraft is something that we could possibly look to in the future. Payments have been made available to individuals and families who have been affected by the floods. I understand that those payments are flowing but if there are individuals out there who are struggling or who are having problems with Centrelink, I encourage them to contact my office or the offices of the member for Herbert or the member for Kennedy. Part of our role is to ensure that support that should be getting through on the ground is getting through. If there is a hold-up in the cases of particular individuals with government departments or with Centrelink, who do a fantastic job generally, then by all means you should contact your local federal member. We have a bipartisan approach to responding to natural disasters. We have seen that in relation to the bushfires. We see it again in relation to the flood. I encourage anyone out there who is having trouble to contact their local federal member. We will work with them to help them out. I want to put on the record again my deep admiration for the volunteers who work so hard, whether in the floods or in the bushfire ravaged areas. We need to thank them for the work they do. That includes the elected representatives, local councillors and others who work tirelessly to support their local communities. I also want to thank the government workers who may be getting paid but during these important times spend many hours of overtime that they can never recoup supporting these communities. I thank everyone from Emergency Management Queensland to the Department of Community Services to the Centrelink workers. I want to put on record again my strong belief that we will recover from these floods, as we have done in the past in North Queensland. It does take time. I also want to express my deepest sympathies and sorrows for those in Victoria. From our experience, the recovery effort does take time. You can never forget disasters that you go through but, in the end, you can learn to live with them. Let us hope and pray for that outcome for those victims of the bushfires and the floods. These have been terrible tragedies for those individuals. in relation to the floods in Queensland, I wish to express my condolences and those of my constituents and my family to all of the victims of the horrific fires that have occurred in Victoria. It is hard even to comprehend the tragedy and how this will affect communities for years to come. I have to say that I have admired the bipartisan support of this parliament and the way the Australian people have united to help their fellow Australians. I have admired the way this parliament has worked. It demonstrates that, when times are tough and we get these horrific events in Australia, we can work together for the betterment of our Australian communities. I also want to thank the volunteers, the charitable organisations like the Red Cross, the churches, the military personnel, the doctors and nurses, the police and the emergency services. They must be witnessing things that are absolutely horrific. I admire the professional way that they go about their work and the expertise that they have. To all of those people, on behalf of the constituents of Maranoa, I extend our condolences and our deepest admiration for the work that they are doing. I commend the bipartisan approach that we have taken as a parliament to say, ‘Whatever we have to do to help these communities and these families recover, we will do.’ MAIN COMMITTEE",255,Queensland Floods
244,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (12.17 Pm),"On indulgence: prior to making a statementDorothea MacKellar’s My Country poem has been spoken of with respect to the firestorms in Victoria, the droughts in many parts of Australia still ravaging communities and the floods in Queensland. The floods affect the western part of my electorate of Maranoa, and that is what I want to talk about today. These floods have cut off communities for three to four weeks already and will for many weeks to come, because as we speak there is even more rain falling into the headwaters of the Diamantina, the Georgina and the Thomson rivers in the Lake Eyre Basin. The member for Mayo just said to me, ‘Can you send some water down to the Lower Lakes of the Murray?’ Unfortunately these rivers feed into the Lake Eyre Basin, and I am sure we are going to see Lake Eyre itself filled as a result of these floods. The Diamantina and the Georgina rivers have cut off the two communities of Birdsville and Bedourie for the last three weeks, and the water is still cutting off those communities from the outside world. I was talking to someone in the shire of the Diamantina only yesterday. She is new out there, having taken up a position in the Diamantina Shire. She said, ‘Well, we’ve been cut off for three weeks now and I don’t know whether I’ll ever get out of this place!’ We know that the floods in this part of Queensland are enormously beneficial. One great benefit from these floods-apart from the tragedy of the loss of life, the loss of livestock and the loss of fences-across the gulf will be the water that will replenish our rivers and, importantly, the Great Artesian Basin. A lot of the water that is fed into our Great Artesian Basin enters in the rivers and streams of Northern Australia, across the gulf. A moment ago I mentioned the loss. We talk about the loss of life and the loss of property, but there has been an enormous loss of cattle in the gulf and down through the Georgina and Diamantina rivers areas. I was talking to pastoralists there, and they said there was certainly going to be some loss of cattle. I have photographs in my office of cattle wading through water. Whether they can get out of the water is debatable. When floods occur out there, they nearly always have a chance to move them out into the sand dunes and into some of the high country. Some of this rain fell just so rapidly and with such intensity they have been unable to get out and move them in time. They have been able to get out in helicopters and see what is going on. They confront these sorts of floods from time to time. To give you some idea of the enormity of the water that is coming down the Georgina and the Diamantina into Eyre Creek, I will say this. I was talking to David Brook from Birdsville. He had just flown up from Adelaide. An interesting contrast was that they were flying up in their light plane from Adelaide and they had to stop flying because of dust storms. They could not see and they were flying visual, so they had to land and they went on the next day. Some of this water that is going into the Diamantina and the Georgina will end up in the Goyder Lagoon, which is in South Australia. That is filling now. He said that Goyder Lagoon to Birdsville is about 150 kilometres on the old Birdsville Track and that 100 kilometres of that track is under water. If you look west from there, there is another 100-odd kilometres of water. There is a similar situation to the east and to the north, right up to Bedourie. There is almost a sea of water out there. It is filling clay pans and lakes that have been dry for years, but it is going to have a long-term beneficial effect for the community. I want to touch on another issue, and that is services to those communities. These communities had an air service that had been subsidised by the Queensland government, and I commend the Queensland government and the Queensland minister on that. The service was provided by MacAir. They had been having financial difficulty for some time, and in the middle MAIN COMMITTEE of all this they went into voluntary administration. That left these communities without any connection to the outside world, and the only connection was by air. The Queensland government put in place a replacement for that service in the form of Skytrans but there was some suggestion that, until they were actually registered with CASA and their pilots had had licences approved, those communities may be totally without any service. It did cause some concern for me last week. I want to thank the office of the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. They moved absolutely heaven and earth to make sure that the bureaucracy of CASA did not stand in the way of what had to be done. The staff were absolutely outstanding and I want to thank them for that. Within two days those licences were approved for some 26 services in Queensland, including across the gulf and out of Cairns and Townsville. These are services that are providing mail, food and medical supplies into the communities and also moving passengers. These services are the only way that those communities can get any of those services in. SoI just want to thank the minister for that. I would like to conclude by saying that as these floodwaters recede, as they inevitably will, during the course of the year it is going to leave across Northern Australia an enormous body of grass that will eventually dry off. As it dries off, it too will present an enormous fire risk in the future. So from the flooding rains to drought and the potential for fire to follow, this is part of what nature gives us from time to time. I know that my time is nearly up and that the member for Moreton would like to say a few words. I will allow him a couple of moments if that is what he would like. things you need to put on the record then please go ahead. ate, the Diamantina shire, certainly wants to thank the minister for transport for his support in getting those air services back in place so quickly. I know that this will present enormous opportunities for outback tourism as the floodwaters recede this winter. It is out there that the pelican builds its nest, and we will have huge numbers of pelicans and other bird life out there. If people want to do something to help these economies as the winter comes on this year then I can recommend a visit to the outback to see the wonders of nature-the positive side, the beautiful parts of nature. Once again on behalf of my constituents I convey our deepest heartfelt condolences, our thoughts and our prayers to all those victims of the fires. I know the financial support flowing from so many Australians and this parliament as well will help them. Treasurer regarding the devastating floods in Queensland’s north and north-west. I commend the contributions of the member for Maranoa and the member for Leichhardt. Whilst in Victoria fire has unleashed our nation’s most horrific tragedy, in North Queensland it is nature’s fury of another kind that we are seeing. I was particularly taken with a photograph from the Australian on Thursday, February 5, showing the Queensland Deputy Premier Paul Lucas surveying the damage in Ingham with a ‘road subject to flooding’ sign just about underwater and the street sign just about underwater as well. The floods first came about almost a fortnight ago in the wake of ex-tropical Cyclone Ellie.

247,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (12.27 Pm),"On indulgence: I rise to support the remarks of theflooded-with more than 3,000 houses affected in the town of Ingham alone, where water peaked at 12 metres. Thankfully the floodwaters have begun to recede over the last few days. However more heavy rains are forecast. In fact just before coming up to the Main Committee I spoke to my sister-in-law Diane Black in Innisfail and she said that it is about to come down again there. If this does eventuate, North and Far North Queensland may be facing rising floodwaters all over again. The Queensland government has estimated flood damage to be in the order of hundreds of millions of dollars. Of course mere dollar values will never give us a real sense of the disaster, and obviously with lives having been lost these are very difficult times indeed. The ongoing flood situation has left many temporarily displaced from their homes, the Bruce Highway closed and many cut off from food and supplies. The flood has also brought with it the risk of disease and mosquito-borne viruses. The true damage will not be known until the floodwaters recede in places like Ingham and residents can begin to take stock. North Queensland is no stranger to disaster. My wife is a North Queensland girl and most of my in-laws live up there. North Queenslanders have a particular resolve and courage to overcome what Mother Nature throws at them. We will never forget the impact of Cyclone Larry almost three years ago. Back on the morning of 20 March 2006, my in-laws in Innisfail, Dianne and Jeffrey Black, woke to find homes and businesses destroyed, crops flattened and livelihoods left in ruins by the category 4 cyclone. But that was not the end of the story. The community picked themselves up, dusted off and embarked on the biggest relief, recovery and reconstruction effort ever mounted in Queensland’s history. The Queensland government spent at least $300 million rebuilding the community, and local councils and the federal government and the public all pitched in to help. North Queenslanders have endured before and they will do it again. It is in that same spirit of mateship and community that they will come together, clean up, repair and get back on their feet again when the water eventually flows away. I particularly want to acknowledge the hard work of emergency services personnel and those saints, the SES volunteers. These are special, courageous workers who have braved the floodwaters to rescue people caught in floodwaters and to help evacuate stranded communities. I also want to commend the Queensland government’s response. Led by Premier Anna Bligh, Deputy Premier Paul Lucas, Emergency Services Minister Neil Roberts and Treasurer Andrew Fraser the Queensland government has been working with the Red Cross to evacuate residents and get essential foodstuffs and medical supplies into flood affected areas. The Rudd government have also stepped up to support those affected by the floods. Through our Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, the Queensland government receives funding to provide grants for food, clothing, accommodation, emergency housing repairs and for expenditure on public infrastructure restoration. We are also making disaster recovery payments available to residents in Ingham who have been seriously injured or who have had their homes flooded. These are one-off, lump-sum payments of $1,000 for adults and $400 for each child to help support their recovery in the short term. These payments are available through Centrelink to eligible recipients and are intended to help people purchase the necessities they need to survive in the days following these horrible floods. We must remember that many have lost everything. The Australian Defence Force have also MAIN COMMITTEE pitched in. They have helped deliver more than 4,500 ration packs directly to Ingham residents. I know, as we reflect on the disasters before us, many Australians are shaking their heads, asking not only, ‘How could this happen?’ but also, ‘How can we help?’. One way we can help is to dig deep and make a donation to help flood victims. Anyone can do this through the Queensland Premier’s Disaster Relief Appeal Fund at any of the big banks, including the Commonwealth, Westpac, NAB, ANZ, Suncorp-Metway and the Bank of Queensland or by calling 1800173349. I understand that all donations are tax-deductible and distribution of the funds will be undertaken by the Red Cross. When the floodwaters finally retreat, North Queensland residents will face a long and painful clean-up. Our thoughts and prayers are with them all. I know that families, friends and neighbours will help each other out. The government will help out where it can and North Queensland’s flood ravaged communities will get back on their feet. Debate (on motion by Ms Grierson) adjourned. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (12.33 pm)-I move: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Paterson Electorate: Health Services he would take responsibility for fixing our hospital system and that the buck would stop with him. If this is the case, can the Prime Minister please tell me why healthcare facilities in Paterson are still not up to par? Health services in my electorate of Paterson are becoming a shambles. Take for example the Cape Hawke-now named Forster-Private Hospital saga, which began many years ago with a public campaign for 20 beds to be leased by the New South Wales government. The next closest hospital is Manning Base Hospital, located 35 kilometres away in Taree. With very little public transport between the two areas, there is little choice for residents in the region. The issue culminated in September 2007 when Reba Meagher, the then health minister, finally made an announcement committing 20 public beds to be made available at the public hospital by December 2007. This promise never eventuated-there was just red tape and delays. I have worked with Terry Clout, the former CEO of the Hunter-New England Area Health Service, and his replacement Nigel Lyons, but the bureaucracy has reigned supreme. All Paterson constituents and I continue to hear about are more delays and more issues. All the time the Forster-Tuncurry community has been purposely disadvantaged. I am now informed after all this time that the ‘contracts’ were signed in January but-now for new delays-the contracts are waiting on the desk of the New South Wales Department of Health for Minister John Della Bosca to sign off on. Since September 2007, almost monthly promises have been made. When will the minister see fit to stop punishing the people of Forster-Tuncurry? When will beds be provided for palliative care, low-level care, respite and accommodation for the aged waiting to be placed in aged-care facilities? It is about time the New South Wales Labor government pulled up their socks and delivered on the promises that will assist Forster and Tuncurry residents rather than MAIN COMMITTEE",260,Queensland Floods
248,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (12.33 Pm),"In 2007 the Prime Minister told Australians thatcontinuing to put their needs on the backburner. Perhaps the Prime Minister should step in and take control of the situation, just as he said he would. The wait that sick and needy Forster-Tuncurry residents have had to incur is unacceptable. These beds are needed now. The New South Wales Labor government has dragged the chain for long enough. For years, Forster and Tuncurry patients’ quality of life has been hampered due to the New South Wales Labor government’s inability to act efficiently and to commit sufficient funding for rural hospitals. The government needs to stop playing the blame game and coming up with lame and offensive excuses. They need to act and they need to act now. In stark contrast, the coalition’s commitment to improving health care was paramount. The former Howard government strengthened Medicare with the addition of the Medicare safety net to help with out-of-hospital expenses such as specialist visits. We increased bulk-billing to the highest rate ever. We strongly encouraged people to take responsibility for their own health insurance by introducing the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate and Lifetime Health Cover, which allows health funds to charge different rates for people who join at different ages. We massively boosted immunisation coverage to both protect and reduce future costs. However, in just 15 short months, the Rudd Labor government and the New South Wales Labor government have let the people of Paterson down and, furthermore, people across the entire nation are without hope. Treasury estimates that the Rudd Labor government’s decision to increase the Medicare surcharge threshold will force more than 500,000 people to drop their private health insurance and join public hospital queues. This will cause havoc in public hospitals. For public hospitals like those in the Paterson electorate such as Gloucester, Bulahdelah, Dungog, Tomaree and Maitland, which are already struggling with limited resources, the Rudd Labor government will not stand up and take charge as they promised. While the Rudd Labor government have promised $950 cash flashes for countless Australians in their proposed $42 Nation Building and Jobs Plan, did they forget about our hospitals when they neglected to allocate funding for the healthcare system, which is currently buckling under pressure due to increased financial strains imposed by the federal government? And, Prime Minister, can you please explain why there are no GP super clinics up and running across Australia, as was promised by you to be the case by the end of 2008? We are all waiting; and not so patiently, I might add. I remind you of your words, Prime Minister, when you announced in the lead-up to the election, ‘I have a long-term plan to fix our nation’s hospitals. I will be responsible for implementing my plan and I state this with absolute clarity: the buck will stop with me.’ Again, Prime Minister, the people are not only sick and tired but sick and dying, as they wait for you to deliver on your promises. use of the term ‘you’ is not appropriate through the chair because I do not think I am the Prime Minister. It would be interesting, but I am not. So use of the word ‘you’ is not recommended. the Prime Minister. MAIN COMMITTEE",262,Adjournment

That is what I am trying to advise him. Braddon Electorate late this government on its long-term and short-term attempts to tackle some of the health issues in this country, and none more so than in Braddon. I would remind the member for Paterson that it was his government that intervened directly in a hospital in my electorate. If you were so concerned, how come it was not in your electorate? The reason is, mate, that it was not marginal enough; but it is now. So you ought to go and do your job, instead of moaning about everyone else! I would like to discuss a very positive thing that is happening in my electorate of Braddon. I would like to congratulate the government on the commencement of rolling out the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, which the member from Paterson and his constituents will benefit from. First and foremost, there will be more than $800,000, and I would like to share the details with you, Madam Deputy Speaker. There will be $235,000 going to the Burnie Council, on top of earlier funding by the Commonwealth, for the Cooee Indoor and Outdoor Bowls Centre. I know they are very grateful to this government for investing in this vital community infrastructure. Only yesterday I announced $277,000 for the Circular Head Council and $339,000 for the Wynyard Waratah Council for ready-to-go local infrastructure projects. The Circular Head Council will receive this funding to deliver important local projects, including the extension and upgrade of the East Duck River Foreshore Trail, the West Esplanade Trail and the West Esplanade Foreshore Park. I hope that when anyone in this chamber visits the north-west coast of Tasmania they get an opportunity to go to Circular Head to experience this beautiful part of the country and to see how these projects will add to very important community infrastructure and amenities. As well as the funding announced for Circular Head, $277,000 will go to the Wynyard Waratah Council for extensions to the Somerset Foreshore Walkway and the East Wynyard Walkway, again adding to the tremendous social and community amenities and at the same time offering employment and skills development opportunities to our local communities at this time of increasing difficulty in our economy. I would also like to congratulate the Minister for Ageing, Justine Elliot, who visited the electorate and, after much positive lobbying, inaugurated a regional project that we hope will be a model we can share with other regional centres throughout Australia in order to develop better ways of integrating services and staffing in our community based aged-care centres. The minister was kind enough to offer funding to support this. We are now working through a scoping study to draw up a tender for someone to come and investigate ways that not-forprofit community aged-care facilities can work together better to tackle this issue. It is a particularly difficult one for community based aged-care centres because, unfortunately, the outgoings do not match the revenue. This issue will become more and more difficult and it is something we all have to face. This project will be one way of trying to share with other regions throughout Australia in tackling that problem. I thank the minister for that most innovative and supportive program.

Kids trust the police and the police trust them, and it is interesting how it has affected behaviour in the area. I congratulate Ian Edwards and the Kommunity Kids program.

Corio Electorate: Wathaurong People stolen generation I want to take this opportunity to say something about the Indigenous people, the Wathaurong people, of the Geelong electorate, in which I live. In the early days of settlement the Wathaurong became one of the most notable tribes to the European settlers through the extraordinary story of William Buckley, an Englishman, who, at the age of 19, was sentenced to transportation to Australia for stealing cloth. He was part of the, ultimately, aborted attempt to establish a colony in 1802-03 around Port Phillip Bay. Within months of his arrival he and his fellow prisoners attempted an escape from the camp. After a few days in the wilderness, they discovered that survival was not going to be as easy as they thought. William Buckley’s fellow escapees attempted to go back to the camp and were never heard of again. Both they and William Buckley were given up for dead by the camp which of course is the beginning of the phrase ‘you’ve got Buckley’s chance’. In fact William Buckley did not die. He was at death’s door when he was taken in by the local Aboriginal tribe, the Wathaurong people. He was cared for; they shared their food with him and over the next 30 years he lived with them, he became a husband, a father and, ultimately, an elder of that community. He emerged from the bush in 1835 in fact to try to prevent a conflict between those from John Batman’s camp and the Wathaurong people. He was dressed in kanMAIN COMMITTEE",265,Adjournment
254,Mr Marles (Corio) (12.48 Pm),"On the eve of the anniversary of the apology to thegaroo skins, carrying Aboriginal weapons and he had forgotten how to speak English but ultimately regained that ability. He was given a pardon, became an interpreter for the colony at the time, and ended up marrying again and moving down to Tasmania where he died at the age of 75. In the history of Australia both Indigenous and non-Indigenous surely William Buckley’s life must be one of the most extraordinary lives ever lived on this continent. It is an extraordinary story; they ought to make a movie about it. I tell it now because what ought to be celebrated from it is that it is truly one of the great first acts of reconciliation on the part of the Wathaurong people to take in this man. It gave so much promise of a future that could have been very different to what ultimately transpired. The Wathaurong people now live in Geelong and are very active through the Wathaurong Aboriginal Cooperative with its CEO, Trevor Edwards. It is an organisation which is at the forefront of self-determination. Since its formation 30 years ago, it has always been driven by the belief that services for Aboriginal people must be provided by Aboriginal people. It is a highly successful community facility now staffed by 35 people providing health care, child care, drug and alcohol services, juvenile services and many others. Its medical and dental clinic is a great example of a service responding to community needs. It has two doctors at the moment and they are hoping to take on a third. Wathaurong also invests in local jobs. One of its most successful and remarkable start-ups has been Wathaurong Glass, which is a mix of industry and artistry. It started as a Work for the Dole project and now employs five full-time staff. They create everything from household items to pool fencing to highly visual design pieces for the corporate sector. Nelson Mandela was presented with a piece of their work during his visit here in the year 2000, and many of the giant football club trophies are now made by Wathaurong Glass. Wathaurong’s CEO Trevor Edwards says that the cooperative’s success demonstrates how crucial it is for Indigenous people to have their own services. Housing provision is a big part of their work. Unfortunately, the need for Indigenous housing in Geelong greatly outstrips the supply. These days Geelong is also home to a wider group of Indigenous people than just the Wathaurong. Indeed the Geelong region within Victoria has the largest Indigenous population outside of Melbourne, encompassing 4,500 people. Many of those have a very sad story typical of the survivors of the stolen generation, because for much of the 20th century Geelong had six orphanages, the highest number of orphanages outside of any capital city, which means that there are a large number of people living in Geelong who grew up in orphanages. Of course it was to these orphanages that many of the stolen generation went and in these orphanages that many of the stolen generation grew up. So these days a lot of the stolen generation now live in Geelong and form part of the Wathaurong’s broader family. So on the anniversary of the apology to the stolen generation it is a great honour for me not only to pay my respects to the traditional owners of the land in which my electorate is based but also to celebrate the wonderful contribution that they make to Geelong life. Cowan Electorate: Wanneroo talk in this place about an issue of great concern to the people who are part of the suburb of Wanneroo within my electorate of Cowan. As members would probably not know, Cowan is bounded on the west side by the Mitchell Freeway but basically through the centre of Cowan MAIN COMMITTEE",266,Adjournment
255,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (12.53 Pm),"I have very recently been given an opportunity torunning north to south there is an arterial road called Wanneroo Road. Around the centre of the electorate this road is intersected with Ocean Reef Road. On the north-west corner of this intersection there is a little oasis of very pleasant houses known as the Regent Waters Estate, which is part of the suburb of Wanneroo. Unfortunately, a number of streets within this estate are affected by a great amount of hooning, reckless driving and transiting traffic that comes from further north to avoid a set of traffic lights. The problem for a lot of local people is that the amenity of their lifestyle is greatly affected by this hooning and through traffic. The people have nothing to do with the area; they are merely there to avoid having to sit at another set of traffic lights on Wanneroo Road. The intersection on Wanneroo Road gives people the opportunity to turn west onto Ocean Reef Road and then go down the Mitchell Freeway into the central business district of Perth. A lot of people take that route. As I said before, people detouring through the Regent Waters Estate impacts negatively on the people who live on James Spiers Drive, Tyne Crescent and Backshall Place. I have been involved in this issue with the local people over a couple of years now since before I was elected. I was interested in trying to help resolve the issue. It is the responsibility of the City of Wanneroo to resolve this issue. I wrote to the former state minister for infrastructure and to the Director-General of Main Roads in Western Australia suggesting certain changes to the streets and the blocking of certain streets to alleviate the problem. The response I got at that time was that it was up to the City of Wanneroo. About a year ago or a little longer it was recommended to the elected members of the City of Wanneroo that a trial take place of certain roadblocks and changes to the design of the streets. The city’s councillors, led by the two local councillors, decided that they would not proceed with that and that they would rather wait for an extra turning lane to be put on the southbound lane of Wanneroo Road to turn into Ocean Reef Road. They thought that would resolve the problem. Sadly, that has not been the case. There has been no resolution. The problems for the good people living on James Spiers Drive, Tyne Crescent and Backshall Place continue. It is a great source of disappointment to me that this matter has dragged on since way before my involvement. I look forward to the elected members of the City of Wanneroo doing what is right, stepping up and making sure that the future amenity of the people who live on these affected streets is looked after. It is right for elected members to do that. They have the opportunity to make changes to these streets. I look forward to that being done as quickly as possible. They have missed opportunities in the past. It is their responsibility. It is about time they got on and did their jobs so that the people in that area have the best quality of life. It is a beautiful little area that is being let down by the lack of action by the City of Wanneroo. Australia Day Australia organise local events and celebrate Australia’s national day. Traditionally, citizenship ceremonies are held and local people are recognised for their contribution to their community. These events have become synonymous with and part of Australia Day celebrations, and rightly so because citizenship and recognising the voluntary work of many people are both part of the Australian culture. On Australia Day this year, I attended two functions: one was organised by the City of Tea Tree Gully and the other was organised by the City of Salisbury. At both functions people beMAIN COMMITTEE",267,Adjournment
256,Mr Zappia (Makin) (12.58 Pm),"Each year on Australia Day communities right aroundcame Australian citizens and people within the local community were recognised. In fact, about 120 people became Australian citizens at the two ceremonies I attended. As usual, it was wonderful to see the excitement in their faces when they were handed their citizenship certificates. I want to acknowledge the people that were recognised at those two events here in the House today. The City of Tea Tree Gully Citizen of the Year Award went to Brian Emery. He has been a volunteer involved with the Kiwanis, the Catholic Parish of Para Hills and Modbury and also the Tea Tree Gully Golf Club. He commenced his involvement with these organisations way back in 1972 and has worked between 12 and 25 hours per week during this time. The citation goes on and on, but time will not permit me to go through it in detail, However, he is certainly someone who is very much worthy of the recognition he was given. The Community Group of the Year Award went to the Naturally Green Gardeners. They provide a low-level gardening service to Home and Community Care eligible clients who are at risk of premature entry into a residential care facility. It provides a one-off gardening service to those clients with small gardens. Of particular interest is the fact that volunteer group members give up their time on Monday and Tuesday mornings to assist clients, who are mainly frail, aged people and younger people with disabilities. This is a matter that the House is discussing right now. The Sportsperson of the Year Award went to Brendon Twiggs. Brendon commenced playing lacrosse for the North Adelaide Lacrosse Club in 2003 in the under-17 team. He was chosen to play in the state under-17 side and also the Australian under-17 team. He then went on to play senior lacrosse with the North Adelaide Lacrosse Club in 2004. He was selected for the under-21 Australian side in 2007, where he was appointed captain for the Asia-Pacific Games. In October 2008 he represented South Australia in the Australian championships in Perth. He was awarded a 12-month scholarship for lacrosse at the Globe Institute of Technology in New York in 2007-08. He has been selected for the Australian lacrosse squad to compete at the World Cup in Manchester in 2010. The City of Salisbury Community Group of the Year Award went to Boost Media Skills. This is a program that offers young people the opportunity to learn new skills, to develop the skills they already have and to make a contribution which will encourage them to think about their future career choices. An alternative education program, coordinated through Officer for the City of Salisbury, and Boost Media Skills was attended by Harley Soltan, Stephanie Warren and Richard Sims. The City of Salisbury Young Citizen of the Year Award went to Josh Baldwin. He is a passionate and dedicated young man who advocates on behalf of other young people. Josh has played an active role on the Salisbury Youth Advisory Council since 2006. Through his involvement with the Youth Advisory Council, Josh has been involved in the planning, organisation and facilitation of initiatives such as Youth Week, youth forums, the development of the youth centre, the development of a youth strategy and youth careers functions, the development of the Youth Advisory Council website, skate park events and so on. He is clearly a young person who is very active in his community. Lastly, the City of Salisbury Citizen of the Year award went to Susan Emerson. Susan, who works for the Helping Hand organisation, is a committed, dedicated and enthusiastic woman MAIN COMMITTEE who works to provide older people with a better quality of life and to effectively engage them with other generations. She has been instrumental in assisting young school children to connect with older members of the community, and she is renowned for bringing people, businesses and organisations together. These are just some of the people who contribute to those communities. Obviously, each council cannot recognise them all but these people are certainly worthy of recognition, and I congratulate them for the awards they have received. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 1.04 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Migration Inquiries (Question No. 430) Dr Stone asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 28 November 2008: (1) What are the current trends for migration inquiries, including the visa categories, numbers of applications and countries from where these inquiries originate. (2) How long do migration applications take to process by: (a) post; and (b) visa category. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The trend in migration related inquiries has been varied with an overall increase. Call volumes have remained relatively static onshore but increases of up to 22 per cent have been experienced offshore. Attachment A1 refers. Migration related calls appear to have decreased marginally as a percentage of overall call volumes. Pre-lodgement email inquiries regarding skilled migration reduced by 19 percent in 2007-08. Some of the reduction may be due to better access to information through industry outreach activities including regular information sessions, seminars, workshops. Participant attendance at these is averaging 22 per session and more than 30 sessions are occurring per month. Access to information through the department’s web site may also be a factor. Web site inquiries have increased by approximately 25 per cent in the past twelve months with the daily average page views in November 2008 reaching 668 556. The top ten global access points are Australia (31.9%), United Kingdom (6.3%), United States (5.5%), India (4.5%), Sri Lanka (2.5%), China (2.3%), Philippines (1.7%), Canada (1.3%), New Zealand (1.2%) and both Germany and Singapore (1.1% each). The newly launched visa wizard which provides visa application information to clients via the website is averaging 5200 views daily during the week and 4017 daily over weekends. Application rates for skilled migration since 1 July 2008 have averaged 11 750 per month. There was a spike in application rates ahead of the reforms which came into effect in September 2007. Skilled migration applications rates then fell to approximately 10 010 per month before steadily increasing to the current level. Application rates for family migration since 1 July 2008 have averaged 8050 per month which is approximately 7.3 percent less than the average in 2007/08. (2) Detailed information on processing performance against service standards broken down by post and visa category is at Attachment A2. The number of applications lodged by post and visa category since 1 July 2008 is also shown. Attachment A1-Client Enquiry Data DIAC operates two onshore contact centres in Melbourne and Sydney and two offshore contact centres located in London and Ottawa. The London Contact Centre (LCC) handles calls from the UK and Ireland. The Ottawa Contact Centre (OCC) handles calls from Canada, the USA, the Caribbean and parts of South America. In addition, data for the DIAC office in Shanghai post has been included to give an indication of volume for the China region. The onshore and offshore contact centres report slightly differently on the categories of visa classes they handle due to their particular client service focus in that region. The data below represents client selection when they enter the IVR and is not always indicative of the actual enquiry. The nationality of the caller is captured in Ottawa only.",268,Adjournment
