291,To Do That Immediately. Mr Speaker,"Order! It being 8 p.m.,Wednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28167 Wednesday, 20 June 2001 ----Education: Schools Funding the federal Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs that he must do all in his power to bludgeon and marginalise public education. In case that statement is regarded as overstated by those opposite, let me prove it to all in this chamber by referring to the only statistic that means anything in the expenditure on education. The percentage of GDP expended on education is falling, and falling dramatically. In 1996-97, it was 2.06 per cent. For 2001-02, it will be around 1.6 per cent. That is a 20 per cent cut. That is the real truth-forget all the other statistics. They account only for inflation and increased enrolments. Historically, elitist conservative forces in Victoria have always tried to marginalise public education. It is part of the psyche in certain quarters in that state. It is still the case, particularly, with the current education minister. This minister is to dogma as propaganda is to indoctrination-George Orwell describes him most accurately. He continues a long line of elitist conservative propaganda agents in Victoria who have always tried to marginalise public education. Those of us who are from states other than New South Wales and Victoria are often bored by the many senseless debates between proponents of those states. However, one comparison between New South Wales and Victoria is particularly edifying when it comes to public and private education. A Victorian educational researcher found that in New South Wales over half the people with entries in Who’s Who were educated in public schools. But when it came to Victoria, over half came not only from private schools but from just five schools: Scotch College, Wesley College, Geelong Grammar, Melbourne Grammar and Geelong College. How much more elitist conservative can you possibly get? The minister obviously wants to keep it that way-just look at where the Victorian contingent of cabinet frontbenchers went to school. This continues an evil tradition of conservative forces in Victoria when it comes to education. In the early 1900s the so-called top private schools in Victoria were successful in limiting the breadth of curriculum offerings in public schools. That is what they went in to bat for, and they actually won it-hard to believe, but true. At various times, even in the 1950s, that divisive debate was continued by elitist conservatives in Victoria to retain for private schools a competitive edge. Of course, the practice of cherry picking the most able from public schools operated then as it does now. Judgment day comes for people who do harm to the future national interest of this nation.

The proposals were to restore the heritage site at Captain Cook’s landing place, to build a museum of reconciliation to celebrate and recognise the meeting of two cultures at Kurnell, to purchase three parcels of privately owned land-zoned 7b-to restore it environmentally for conversion into national park, and to allow the Australand corporation to proceed with its development proposal. In total, 392 completed surveys were received in response from the two areas-144 from Kurnell and 248 from north Cronulla. In regard to the purchase of 7b lands, over both areas the buyback of the degraded lands proved the most popular option, with 351 of the 392 respondents either strongly agreeing or agreeing with it. It was also the proposal that produced the most polarised opinions, with only 14 people indicating that they were indifferent to it. In addition, 73 per cent of respondents rated this as their most preferred option, while only four per cent rated it as their least favourite option. The buyback was more popular amongst North Cronulla residents than Kurnell residents with 75 per cent of North Cronulla respondents rating it a top priority as against 66 per cent in Kurnell. The Australand development proposal was the most unpopular proposition-233 of 392 strongly disagreed with it and 30 disagreed. While 96 either strongly agreed or agreed, only 25 people were indifferent. Sixty-two per cent of respondents across both areas ranked it at No. 4 or least preferred option while it was the favourite option of 14 per cent of respondents. Australand was far more unpopular amongst North Cronulla residents with 70 per cent of them citing it as their least favourite option as opposed to 46 per cent in Kurnell. Improvement of the existing heritage site and inscription points so it better reflects the important place it holds in modern history was the second most popular option. Three hundred and thirteen of 392 respondents agreed or strongly agreed while 30 disagreed and 41 were indifferent. The Museum of Reconciliation concept also received considerable support, 226 agreeing with it while 59 disagreed. By way of conclusion, my survey has conveyed a fairly strong message from the residents of Kurnell and North Cronulla. For the most part they are very keen about the proposal to purchase the degraded lands of the peninsula. Having said this, it is very difficult to move forward a significant way with this proposal without having a concrete land evaluation at this stage. I have heard estimates ranging from as low as $2 million to $3 million up to several hundred million. Clearly this is not a focused enough figure to have a meaningful dialogue.

The total amount along with the state contribution would almost complete the Calder Highway duplication program. Mr Howard is definitely attempting to advertise his way out of trouble while pouring millions of taxpayers’ dollars into the pockets of television advertising companies. In September 1995, Mr Howard attacked the current guidelines on government advertising and promised that he would ask the Auditor-General to draw up new rules for government advertising. The Auditor-General stated: There were no guidelines or protocols on information in advertising ... covering matters such as distinguishing between government and party political advertisements, the distribution of unsolicited material and the conduct of campaigns in the lead-up to an election. The Auditor-General then proposed draft guidelines to rectify the matter. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit issued guidelines based on the Auditor-General’s report in September 2000 with the unanimous recommendation that they be adopted. Mr Howard in parliament yesterday was touting guidelines he attacked in 1995 and is now ignoring the advice of the Auditor-General, advice that he sought or requested in 1995. This advertising campaign is a blatant and scandalous taxpayer funded, party political attempt by this coalition to attempt to hide the tricky, mean-spirited and out of touch image that this government is so renowned for. As I have already said, a small fraction of this scandalous misuse of taxpayer funds would have licensed much needed MRI equipment at the Bendigo Health Care group and the total amount along with the state contribution would almost complete the Calder Highway duplication program.

Attorney-General the support his department might extend to Australians in the international arena when they face complexities with the operation of overseas criminal justice systems. In 1998 and 1999 I spoke in the House, during the adjournment debate, about the frightful circumstances of constituents of mine, a family whose son was murdered in Greece in the middle of 1998. This boy’s name was George Karalis. The matter is, obviously, deeply grieving to the family because of the essential circumstances-it was a particularly horrific murder-but their grief has been added to dramatically by the extreme difficulties they have been experiencing in getting the necessary degree of cooperation from the Greek authorities. Inadequate cooperation has been given not only to them but to Australian judicial bodies, in this case the Coroner’s Court in Victoria. In 1998 the Victorian Coroner issued an order, which I am quite happy to provide to the Attorney General, for the supply of a significant amount of information. Well over a year later, that order was-through the efforts of the Australian post in Athens, I think-largely complied with but not completely, according to my information. On4 September 2000, the Victorian Coroner’s Court issued a quite detailed request-which once again I would be happy to provide to the Attorney-General-for further information. This request relates to obtaining statements by homicide police officers, the harbourmaster of the port of Rafina and forensic examiners, telephone records and the like. From the detail that the Victorian Coroner is seeking, clearly he is satisfied that there are substantive matters for him to look at, yet this considerable time later we do not seem to be getting anywhere through the post in Athens with the appropriate Greek authorities. This is not a matter of an Australian investigating body seeking to put its nose directly into a matter that ought properly to be within the investigative jurisdiction of an overseas country. We have a situation where clearly the way in which Australian courts, in this case the Coroner’s Court in Victoria, seek to carry out their work is not being successful in the way it ought to be. Certainly there is some criticism by the family and by the family solicitor of the way in which DFAT has operated in this matter.

I raise this general matter with him and will seek his advice in due course. The solicitor for the family, in correspondence with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on 5 March this year, has also raised the question of the circumstances in which the Australian Federal Police might be able to liaise with Greek police in matters of this type. The solicitor for the family refers to a report in 1997 by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee which refers specifically to the disappearance of David Lindner in Iran. That report stated that the presence and liaison of the AFP officer in Nicosia: … encouraged Iranians in their endeavours, and kept that case going when otherwise it might well have ceased to be in the in tray. The family is drawing a comparison with the circumstance of that investigation where, apparently, a foreign jurisdiction was encouraged by its relationship with the AFP to more vigorously pursue an investigation. The suggestion is very strongly made that there may well be a role for the AFP in this case, in terms of encouraging the Greek authorities to, frankly, get off their backsides and handle this matter with the diligence it deserves. That certainly has not been the case. I will raise some of those matters with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but it would be most helpful, at this point, to get the Attorney-General’s view on the general position of his portfolio in these sorts of circumstances, and, in due course, to seek his more detailed advice. (Time expired) funding of legal aid, and that is with respect to family law. I raised this matter in the same debate a couple of years ago with the Attorney-General, and got what I thought was a completely unsatisfactory answer. The answer was that all I was seeking to do was to line the pockets of family law lawyers. The particular issue that I am concerned about is the number of-mostly male-non-custodial parents who find themselves in the Family Court unable to afford proper representation and unable to get legal aid. They usually face their spouse, who does have legal aid and is therefore at a considerable advantage. Many of them run up bills of $10,000 to $20,000 before they realise that their lack of legal aid is going to leave them bankrupt if they persist; they then start to represent themselves and the results of that are normally fairly dreadful. They enter the court and they believe that they are going to get justice. They raise a series of matters that they believe are important and relevant and find that, as far as the court is concerned, they are totally irrelevant, and this adds to their disillusionment and disenchantment. I realise that it would be extremely difficult for the Commonwealth to get itself into the situation of funding both sides of actions, the progress of which is determined by the parties, and that the parties in these situations are at odds with each other and are not necessarily going to behave reasonably, and the costs could be quite inordinate. There is one proposal that I put to the Attorney-General a couple of years ago, and I would like his comments on it noweven if he is not going to comment on the need for more legal aid assistance funding. That is a proposal to allow the cost of family law-at least for an initial set of orders-to be treated as a charge against the assets of the marriage. So that both parties, if they are seeking to preserve as much of the assets of a marriage as they can, would then have a motive for settling the matter, and it would not be a situation where one side was represented and the other side could not afford to be. I think that would be beneficial, I think it is worthy of some exploration and I would be very grateful for the Attorney-General’s views on it. for Maribyrnong, I can mention a few things.

We have had some problems in dealing with Greek authorities in relation to criminal matters. It has not been an entirely satisfactory relationship generally. dition treaty or a mutual assistance in criminal matters treaty. Certainly, we have the capacity, through the AFP, to provide assistance to criminal authorities in Greece if it is requested. Here, the circumstances seem to be the other way around-although the offence is committed in Greece, the investigation is in Australia. I would be happy if the member for Maribyrnong were to either write or speak to me, to my office or the department about the circumstances. Basically, dealing with the Greek authorities is the responsibility of DFAT. The AFP has liaison officers in a number of different locations around the world, as the member for Maribyrnong is probably aware. They may be able to provide some assistance if the requisite action is not being taken in Greece. I issue an invitation to the member to raise the matter in a formal way. On the subject of legal aid, raised by the member for Kingston, the circumstances in relation to legal aid that pertained two years ago are really quite different now. It has been the case for some time that issues relating to contact with children between warring spouses have been a running sore in members’ and senators’ electorate offices. Within the last two years, we have taken two major steps that we hope will alleviate some of the problems. One difficulty that many separating spouses face is the cost of proceedings in the Family Court. Specifically to address that problem-where, for example, a father goes to a lawyer and is told that he will have to put down $10,000 in order to commence a case in the Family Court and he will probably have to pay more, when all that he is seeking is regular contact with his childrenwe have established the Federal Magistrates Service, which is specifically designed to provide a cheaper, faster and simpler service. In fact, it is doing that. It has been a very successful institution and is now readily accessed both by lawyers and by unrepresented litigants. The second step that we have taken is to amend the Family Law Act to make provision for better enforcement of orders relating to contact with children. We have instituted a three-step process under which, at the time of separation, the parents are given some counselling. If there is a subsequent breach of the order, they may be ordered to participate in a counselling process. If breaches continue, at the third step there may be penalties invoked. It only came into operation at the end of last year, so it has not had a long time in operation in order to test the effectiveness of it, but we will obviously be monitoring the process to see how it is working. On the proposal specifically mentioned by the member for Kingston to allow the cost of the initial set of orders to be a charge against the assets of the marriage, my initial reaction is that this is unlikely to work. It does not seem to be a matter of money for many of the people who have intractable problems, particularly in relation to residence of, and contact with, the children. I do not specifically recall this proposal being raised two years ago, but we will look at it and, if we see any merit in it, we will see what can be done. The difficulty will be that the parties will have, at some stage, divided the assets, and most of the problems do not seem to arise in relation to contact where one party is legally aided and the other is not at the time of separation, they seem to arise further down the track when the parties have been separated for some time and the property has been divided. It is a complex issue that we will never fully address, but the measures I have mentioned-the creation of the Federal Magistrates Service and the three-step enforcement of contact orders process-will assist. The syndrome of the male ‘non-custodial’-that is the word used by the member for Kingston; I would urge him not to refer to ‘custody’ but to refer to ‘residence’, as the 1995",145,Representatives Main Committee

While there is no doubt both merits and demerits on both sides of the issue, legal aid is not the only thing that is going to resolve the issues between parents who are squabbling over the custody or residence of their children. In this context, we anticipate in the very near future a report from a body set up by the former Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Newman, and me called the Family Law Pathways Advisory Group. That body was set up to look at the routes taken by participants in the family law system and how we can better direct people to resolve their issues without ending up in court or in dispute. We look forward with some hope to that report providing a better means for resolving those sorts of issues. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business Proposed expenditure, $1,638,730,000. aware, because of your period in this parliament, that oppositions are constantly being squeezed out of speaking time in the appropriations bill debate-the major legislation of the year. Many of us have not been able to make the kinds of speeches that we think appropriate because of the lack of time provided by the government in the speaking program. Over recent months the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business has made some criticisms of a survey that I conducted in my electorate asking people to respond to the Job Network and how they found it. I had a fairly large number of responses and, following that, I convened a meeting of many of the people who had responded to establish what they saw as being the issues and the concerns-thinking that the minister would be interested in how it was working and what people were saying. Apart from being blackguarded by him in terms of the survey, it is interesting to note that he has been doing similar things himself in recent times. The meeting was quite useful. In more recent times I convened a meeting of the Job Network providers to discuss with them the issues that have been brought forward. Out of all this a number of things came forward. One is my very strong suspicion that the network providers are under enormous duress from the government not to talk. There was a great deal of apprehension as to how they would be seen and how they would be interpreted, and this affected what they said. The second thing that is extremely difficult within this portfolio area is the government’s failure to indicate or to have any transparency as to what the providers or network members are being paid to assist job seekers. That creates a very real problem for the job seeker, who goes to an agency thinking that they are there to help them only to discover-in fact, they do not discover most times-that the agency gets paid only if it finds them a position. That is not the expectation because the job seeker does not think that they are going in there only to be supported if they end up in employment. Of course, the agency says, ‘How much is it worth spending on this person? What are the chances of getting them a job?’ So the more difficult to place people are not very good investments. That conundrum, that almost impossible contradiction between the job seeker and the Job Network member, is at the hub of the discontent and the resentment that is now building up. The fact is the government created a massive expectation that here was a better system. The government kept telling the world how wonderful it was. This was terrific. The job seekers said, ‘This is great. This is good for me. The government is going to help me.’ They go in expecting some help and discover, (a) their material does not get filed, (b) there is",146,Representatives Main Committee

If they think the person may be hard to place, they are a bad investment, in both time and money. In a place like Newcastle this can be quite soul destroying. The number of people that I have now spoken to have been to network provider after provider. They have handed in their material at place after place and are now thoroughly disillusioned. They now get to the next stage, which is a really nice sting in the tail, where the network provider is now required to breach. I had a very simple case not long ago of a man who had an appointment with a Job Network member on a Friday. His son was going to hospital for what was supposed to be minor surgery. He got a call from the hospital that morning that it had turned serious and he spent the whole day in hospital with his son and his family. On the Monday morning he rang the provider to apologise and to explain his circumstances and was told he had already been breached. Within hours of missing the appointment he had been breached. That is the kind of penalty that is happening. It has gone from a situation where there was an expectation of support and help, and all the government’s talk about that, to a situation where these hurdles to jump and hoops to crawl through are now very difficult. What is happening is that people have given up. They accept the punishment. They are not complaining. They have been battered into submission by a combination of a network provider looking at its fiscal interest and a government looking at its political interest. To see the advertising campaigns and the promotion by the government of this program in this kind of way is taking a gross liberty with our community. (Time expired) due to the fact that he had not had an opportunity to speak on the appropriation bills, he wished to pursue other matters, but I am only too happy to go in this particular area of responsibility on the budget. The first thing I want to raise-and I am glad the minister is in here-is the latest unemployment figures in my electorate. We have now seen that the Fairfield local government area, in this quarter, the March quarter, has gone up to 12.5 per cent, the highest level since June 1999. I well remember, and I am sure others would agree with me, that when the Howard government brought in the GST, one of the commitments that was given to the community at large was that it would definitely not affect employment, or unemployment throughout the regions. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, this must have been another core promise on behalf of the Prime Minister and his government because not only has it affected unemployment in my area and sent it up, it has also made a definite increase. One only has to look at where the July figures began in 2000, at the beginning of the GST, when there was 8.7 per cent unemployment. I still regarded that as a little high in my area, but I thought, ‘Fair enough, we will work towards bringing it down.’ I then saw September. It gradually increased in that quarter to 10.2 per cent. I then saw in December 2000 it went up to 11.1 per cent. In the March quarter that has just recently been released, in the Fairfield local government area it is now 12.5 per cent. I then went a little further in my investigation to find out what is happening to the unemployed in my electorate. Needless to say, I was rather disturbed because we all remember the 1996 slash and burn budget of the Howard government when $1.8 billion was removed from training and job assistance programs. I believe that is what my electorate is suffering from. We are actually seeing the long-term effects. I am very proud of my electorate.

But at least they had the opportunity of participating in some schemes that were training them to find jobs in the future. What have we seen this do in the budget, in the allocation in the last year, and particularly just recently? My area now has the highest rate of unemployment in any metropolitan local government area in New South Wales-I am talking about metropolitan areas, not the one rural area where it is higher than in mine. This government has allocated two additional Job Network sites to my electorate in the last 12 months. I thought, ‘At least it is a start; it has given two more sites than we had previously to help train, assist and provide opportunities. At least the jobs are there for unemployed people.’ I then went one step further and looked at my neighbouring electorate of Parramatta, the unemployment figures for which are a lot lower than mine. I found that, while the electorate of Prospect had received two new Job Network sites, the electorate of Parramatta-which would probably have half or even less than half the unemployment rate in my area-received five new Job Network sites. I say to the minister, ‘If we are establishing these sites throughout the areas to assist those in need, how can the government blatantly give two sites to an area that has the highest unemployment rate in metropolitan Sydney and five to the neighbouring electorate that probably has a third of the unemployment rate?’ There has to be an explanation for this. I do not believe, and I suppose I am saying this facetiously, that this minister would be so politically bent that he would be looking after what is classified as a marginal seat-Parramatta. The minister knows that they do not have a hope of winning the seat of Prospect. That is one conclusion that I could come to, but I do not wish to do that. I have certainly voiced my feelings, and I am sure the minister has a logical explanation. I am glad he is in the chair and I hope he gives an explanation when he has the right of reply. I do feel that-and, Mr Deputy Speaker, even you would agree with me-if you, as a government, are going to create these Job Network sites, you should look at Australia as a total, divide it down to the states, from the states to the local regional areas, and from there to where the unemployment need is greatest. Surely that is where you would then make provisions to overcome the problems. Unfortunately, we have now seen this on not one but numerous occasions. I am bringing this one up now only because this is the latest scam-two network sites allocated to my electorate of Prospect and five to my next-door neighbour. I might add that the division between the two seats is virtually a road. So you say that on one side of that road they need five extra sites and on the other side two extra sites. I could even go so far as to say that we could join in and share some of the responsibility, but I can assure you that the ones in Parramatta are very much concerned with the seat of Parramatta, as I presume the ones in Prospect are concerned with Prospect. (Extension of time granted) In deference to my colleagues, I will be quick as there is another matter I would like to raise while I am on my feet-that is, the perennial problem this government has with employees’ lost entitlements. The reason why I say it is a perennial problem, as the minister would realise, is that I was the first to introduce a private member’s bill into the House to deal with the total protection of workers entitlements-not the $20,000 cap, which is what we see now with regulation, but 100 per cent protection of workers entitlements. At that stage, as I repeatedly said, I thought we would see some action along the line. I have reintroduced that bill on four separate occasions. The Labor Party have accepted that as part of our overall policy and I am pleased that, when the Labor Party are elected into government at the next election, that is one of the first changes that we will be making to workers’ rights and entitlements. I think it is appalling that, time and time again, commitments have been given and promises have been made, and yet 28176 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 firm after firm suffers from insolvency through bad administration and the people who still lose out in the end are the workers who lose their entitlements. In the estimates I went one step further, because the estimates show us the figures: we have forward budgets. After June 2003 there is no guarantee of any employee entitlements or finances for that particular area. I say to the minister-and perhaps he will also answer thiswhat happens after 30 June 2003? After all, there has been no legislation. The intention of the government was given to us by the then minister, Minister Reith, who said in parliament-not in a doorstop interview-on 31 August 1999: The intention of the government in respect of our legislative scheme is to work to put a national scheme in place by 1 January. One only has to add it up: if that was 1 January 2000, it is now 93 weeks since then and we still have not seen any legislation. If we have not got a scheme in place by legislation, we have only got it as an administrative scheme, what do we say to the workers out there who are being continually disadvantaged, at times by the collapse of their employers’ businesses? I believe most members would realise that, when you have a person who has worked for a firm, possibly for 20 or 30 years, and given their lifetime to the job, and then finds, when the firm has gone bankrupt or belly-up-as the common saying is-that they are left without any entitlements whatsoever, it is not good enough to say, ‘But we are a government that has put a scheme in and we are probably going to pay them about 20 cents in the dollar.’ They could end up with no more than $20,000. You will find that most of the payments that have gone out, and there have been very few to date, average about $4,000 to $5,000. There are too many Australians out there who are now being affected by this. It is about time that we as a government, particularly the Howard government after the commitments they have repeatedly made, start putting into place a legislative scheme that guarantees the rights of the workers. That has not come in. The Prime Minister has certainly said on numerous occasions that he is very concerned about the workers, that he is going to act for them and that he is concerned about their families losing the entitlements. I wish he would use the same speed, diligence and determination to act for them that he did when he so miraculously introduced the GST-that he was never ever going to have-into this nation last year. At least on this occasion, with workplace entitlements, we have actually heard a number of ministers, from the Prime Minister down, saying, ‘Yes, we are very supportive. Yes, we are going to act.’ But, of course, what we see, both in the budget papers and in the forward estimates, is that we do not have a legislative scheme in place; we have a regulation where funding is no longer going to be guaranteed after 2003. That is not good enough. More importantly, it is not good enough to give an employee part of his entitlement. If I-and I have used this analogy on many occasions-were caught stealing, I would be sent to jail, and rightfully so. But, if an employee is robbed of his entitlements, no-one-and I mean no-one-in this country wants to stand up and do anything. It is not good enough to say that the regulative scheme that is in place is giving them everything they deserve. It does not; it does not go anywhere near it. It is not good enough not to have legislation in this parliament. I know the excuse is going to be given by the minister that the states have got to come into it as well but I believe he should have a national scheme in place. If you have a national scheme in place, you are strong enough to bite the bullet and then you can surely bring the states in under the umbrella of the Commonwealth. This is what the workers out there are demanding. This is what the workers want and they will settle for no less. The cap, the regulative provision that is in there now, is not good enough and more work has got to be done in this regard. (Time expired) Wednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28177 tial Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2001-2002 and I just want the committee to bear with me as I include on the record those comments which were pertinent to the particular departments. I begin, in a roundabout way, with small business. I note the comments that consumer savings are not a great problem. The Prime Minister says that increased consumer spending shows that $12 billion worth of tax cuts are still, in his words, ‘being enjoyed’. I can tell you that in my electorate there are not a lot of people who are enjoying spending. My electorate, apart from the Lithgow sector, is, according to statistics, one of the most economically buoyant rural electorates in the country, with its mix of education, a booming mining sector, a strong public sector and a farming sector which-after years of being downtrodden and having negative returns-is showing signs of sustained returns. I did a spot survey of small business people after the so-called positive growth figures that came out recently, and businesses described their results over the past 12 months as ‘patchy at best’. In Lithgow, a major retailer of a clothing store said that their had been no sales to speak of in the key areas of clothing or shoes since July of last year. The retail story from Orange was not much better. The people in business who I spoke with felt that they were treading water. Savings are down and people are forced to use credit for even their most basic groceries. They have little hope of meeting anything other than the minimum monthly payment, so they are accruing debt which, obviously once it hits their credit limit, is going to cause severe problems. Many of them are feeling that now. The tax burden on middle to lower income people is the same or worse-not less. In particular, it is worse for lower income workers. There seems to have been a massive shift in taxing from the relatively well off to the lower income groups. A reduction in tax for lower income people does not have the impact it has for those on a higher level of income. Although there have been tax cuts for all, the impact of the GST has been on those least able to pay. Credit seems to be driving consumption and it is unsustainable. In the first three months of the year, total credit card debt reached a record high of $18 billion after an unprecedented boom in card use during the Christmas-New Year period, particularly during the January sales period, with falling interest rates making debt more attractive and, indeed, a necessary option. Total credit card debt has risen 30 per cent since the March quarter last year, and any boost of growth in spending is false growth indeed. Growth in spending figures per se can be very misleading. Unemployment is again rising, although only gradually, thank heavens, and underemployment is a fact of life. When I look about me in the shopping malls of Orange and Bathurst, I see young people with young families-many of them in the most basic clothing. Both parents rely on part-time or casual work, if they have jobs, or a mix of family support payments, the dole or whatever to get by. I am glad that commentators are now picking up on the underemployment issue, pointing out that one has to work but an hour a week to not appear in the unemployment statistics, and yet, by any judgment, many of these people are as good as unemployed. It amazes me that it has taken so long for that fact to filter through to mainstream commentators. Underemployment has been the hidden poverty of the deregulated labour market and the downturn in regional areas in recent years. There are people who do not feel by any means comfortable with their way of life. (Extension of time granted) If we continue to throw at these people the fact that interest rates are low, unemployment is looking good and we have created hundreds of thousands of jobs, is it any wonder that they become cynical about that process when they know that things are not warm and comfortable for them?",148,Representatives Main Committee
306,Mr Andren (Calare) (10.33 A.m.),"I too was squeezed out of the debate on this substan28178 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 While a training component for Work for the Dole is long overdue-and I certainly welcome it-the training must be meaningful. Training in information technology has the potential to unlock the lives of the unemployed. I had dinner with a person the other night who is very closely connected with the IT industry-a person of my vintage. She asked me, ‘Do you know anyone who actually makes anything?’ I had to struggle to think of people I know who make things, apart from the people who work at ADI in Lithgow and so on. In terms of close acquaintances, we here in the parliament are moving in areas where information technology is part and parcel of life. We are running into people all the time who live on information creation. That was the point this woman was making. She said that people-even those who in the past we would have regarded as the least skilled manually-can sit in front of a computer and be very computer literate. They know how to handle the technology and they know how to find their way through it. Her argument was that we do not have the sorts of divisions that I have been talking about. We do not have those divisions now, particularly amongst young people, but we need to tap into and encourage the latent ability that is out there amongst so many who are nominally unemployed and who think they have no hope in the older economy. In Lithgow, for instance, their expectations rest with the future of heavy industry. I am trying to suggest-with Lithgow now the first learning city in New South Wales; I launched it a few months ago-that people look over the horizon and beyond heavy industry for their future. People who feel there are no jobs in the mines or in the electricity industry and therefore there is no future have the potential, so close to Sydney, to develop these new technologies and to encourage their kids. I really do think we have an enormous well of talent among people we may have written off when thinking in terms of traditional jobs. If we do not help them to develop the expertise-and I think IT may be the secret here-we will have long-term disconnection, cynicism, suicide and all of those accompanying effects. A few years ago I spoke with Mr Reith about re-badging CDEP-and I have spoken, too, with ATSIC about it-to include the environment. It strikes me that there are any number of training options available in horticulture, irrigation technology, biodiversity and so on that could engage our Koori community in a very positive way. Perhaps they might have some secrets to share with us that we can use to repair our desperately damaged environment. Drawing on their love of the land could probably do a lot for reconciliation. I hope the minister will be able to respond to this. an opportunity in the House to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2001-2002. I want to draw to the minister’s attention one particular problem in my electorate, and I think it may be a much broader national problem, and that is the inflexibility of the Job Network system. In my area I have a high level of indigenous unemployment, which I am sure applies in many parts of Australia. I have people who work within the community-social workers, other providers, people who either are trying to give skills to these people who are unemployed or are actually placing them into jobs-who are not within the Job Network system and are therefore not recompensed for finding people work. They do not begrudge that fact, but there seems to be a system creeping in whereby people in the Job Network who are trying to find jobs for, say, indigenous unemployed people are struggling to do that so they are going outside and getting people in the community to actually find jobs for these people, but then the Job Network people reap the rewards. There seems to be inequity in the system when people can go into the Job Network system and be categorised very early. When they walk in that door they are categorised as ‘Easy to get a job’, ‘Very difficult to get a job’ or ‘Not interested.’ The onus as to whether you have",151,Representatives Main Committee
307,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (10.42 A.m.),"I want to record my disappointment that I did not getWednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28179 any hope of finding a job remains with the person at the reception desk when you walk into a Job Network agency. It is not just about how employable you are; it is about what hope you have of getting past that first person in the reception area. I think this is a really big problem that the minister needs to look at. Perhaps he can look at ways to make the system more flexible so it can address these issues. Constituents have come to me and said, ‘Look, I am finding it hopeless going to Job Network providers because they are not interested in me. I don’t fit into their neat categories of who might be easiest for them to make a profit from. BecauseI don’t fit into those categories, I don’t get looked after-there is nothing there for me.’ I use the example of indigenous employment in particular but I am sure it is a wider problem. Perhaps the minister could look at this situation where outside agencies and other providers who are not part of the Job Network system are actually doing the hard yards, doing the work of trying to find jobs for people but who are then, at the end, finding that it is the Job Network providers who are actually picking up the money for placing those people into work. Business) (10.45 a.m.)-I would like to begin by thanking the members opposite for their contributions. I think all the members opposite who have spoken in this debate have spoken with goodwill and great sincerity, and all of them have raised important and interesting points, which I will attempt to address as best I can in this response. I will begin with the comments made by the member for Newcastle. Essentially, he made three points. The first point he made was that Job Network members in his electorate were, he said, reluctant to speak out publicly about defects in the system. The second point he made was that people going into the Job Network did not have enough of an idea of the resources that might be available to them through the network. The third point he made was about Job Network allegedly breaching people. I would like to make it very clear that, as far as I am concerned and, I am sure, as far as the government generally is concerned, there is no attempt whatsoever to limit debate nor to restrict people’s contributions to building a better society. Obviously, the more that people who know the system speak about the system, the better. However, I think members opposite need to understand that every time a Job Network member damns the system, he or she runs the risk of damning his or her own operations and, if people are not as ready to criticise the system as members opposite might sometimes like, it is probably because they have, on balance, quite a good opinion of the system and they understand that, while simply running things down might make sense in a political context, it rarely makes sense in a context where people are out there trying to do the right thing as best they can under the ordinary difficulties that people face with the system that they have. As members opposite should know by now, the Job Network is a result of a tender process, and the strict prices at which Job Network members are awarded contracts are commercial-inconfidence. However, generally speaking, if we are talking about intensive assistance, there is an up-front payment to the Job Network member of a little over $1,000, with an outcome payment of a little over $2,000 after 13 weeks and another outcome payment of about $1,000 after 26 weeks. Those amounts vary, depending upon the job seeker’s degree of disadvantage and the particular bids that different Job Network members have put in, but that, broadly speaking, is what the average job seeker referred to a Job Network member for intensive assistance can expect will be available. The idea that, just because someone has been categorised in a certain way, the Job Network member has no more than a particular amount to spend on them is misleading. Job Network members do not just deal with individuals on a one-off basis; they are also dealing with the",152,Representatives Main Committee
308,Mr Abbott (Warringah,"Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small28180 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 collectivity of unemployed people in their area. There are some people who go into intensive assistance and quite quickly get work. The Job Network member gets paid outcome payments for those people which the Job Network member is then expected to invest in other job seekers. So some clients may well have far more spent on them than $4,000 or $8,000 or whatever the actual allocation for that client is. In the end, it is really up to the good faith of Job Network members and, while I am sure that there are some people in the Job Network, as there are in all other areas of life, who think a little bit too much of themselves and a little bit too little of others, by the same token the vast majority of people in the Job Network are extremely sincere and dedicated people. It is not easy to work with job seekers, particularly long-term job seekers, and I do not think there are too many grasping and avaricious capitalists out there in the Job Network. Finally, on the question of breaching, Job Network members are expected to notify Centrelink if their clients are not playing by the rules, but no Job Network member actually breaches anyone. In the end, the enforcement role is the responsibility of Centrelink, the government agency, and that is the way it ought to be. (Extension of time granted) The member for Prospect has been a very long-term, distinguished and senior representative of her part of Western Sydney and I would not for a second doubt the member for Prospect’s commitment to her people and her area. I do think that sometimes she rather exaggerates the difficulties that some people face. The member for Prospect does not quite seem to have appreciated, at least for the purposes of this debate, that the Job Network is not something which is micromanaged by the government. The government does not decide, for instance, that we need two Job Network members in Guildford and five Job Network members in Parramatta and three in Liverpool and four in Chatswood and one in Manly. That is not how the Job Network operates. The Job Network operates like this: different members or would be members bid to provide services in particular sites and, on the basis of the way those bids conform with the tender conditions, we then award contracts. There are certainly more Job Network members in the electorate of Prospect now than there were CES officers in the old days. Given the mobility in a metropolitan area such as Sydney, I understand the member for Prospect’s point, but I think that Job Network members in Parramatta are quite capable of helping job seekers in Prospect, just as Job Network members in Prospect, for that matter, are quite capable of helping job seekers in Parramatta. That is the way it ought to work, and that is my understanding of the way it does normally work. On the question of entitlements, congratulations to the member for Prospect for her long campaign on this subject, which I think actually began under the former government-a government which did not actually do anything for the entitlements of workers. This government has. I accept that there are many people who think that more should be done, but the fact is that this is what is being done. I do think it would help the workers of Prospect and other parts of Australia if the member for Prospect were just as eager to get the state government to do its bit under the existing national scheme as she is to promote the virtues of an alternative national scheme which might possibly be put into place one day, if her friends are ever put into government. I was pleased to hear the contribution of the member for Calare. I was recently in the electorate of Calare as part of the Pollie Pedal. I am sorry that the member for Calare was a bit too busy to join us; nevertheless it is always a pleasure to be in that particularly magnificent part of central western New South Wales. It is always possible to get nods of agreement from any audience by telling them how tough life is. I do not accept the member for Calare’s point that the tax burden on low-paid and badly off people has increased. The statistics certainly do not bear him out. Even conceding that it might be true in some instances, the fact is that that tax is Wednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28181 being spent on government programs. You cannot on the one hand complain that taxes are going up and on the other hand that government programs have been cut, because the arithmetic simply does not work out. Underemployment is not a recent phenomenon. The ABS has been running statistical surveys on this for a couple of decades now, I think. At the height of the last recession, when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment and unemployment hit close to 11 per cent, the ABS underemployment statistics showed commensurate problems. If you were to add the numbers of underemployed people to the numbers of unemployed people then, in the way people want to do now, unemployment would not have been about 11 per cent-it would have been about 18 per cent. If you want more work, obviously it is frustrating when you do not have it, but sadly this is not a recent phenomenon. Certainly, the quantum of work appears to be greater now than at any time in the recent past. On the subject of CDEP, I take the point that the member for Calare made. I was in Mossman Gorge in Far North Queensland the other week and they are proposing just that kind of thing-to run a CDEP scheme which will focus on guiding services to tourists in the national park which abuts their community. But CDEP, a little like Work for the Dole and the Job Network, is actually a ground up program. (Extension of time granted). It is driven by the grassroots. If indigenous communities wish to reorientate their CDEPs in this direction, there is nothing to stop them from doing so, and if indigenous communities would like to begin CDEPs along these lines, certainly there would be nothing to stop them putting in applications. I would do whatever I could to try to encourage communities to do that kind of thing, and I would do whatever I could within the constraints of funding to try to make sure it was allowed to happen. Finally, the member for Oxley raised the issue of people who are attempting to help job seekers but outside the ambit of the Job Network. I understand this issue. It does not just happen with indigenous people. There are a number of labour hire companies, for instance, that are outside the Job Network and who believe that they are sometimes subjected to unfair competition from Job Network members. There is nothing to stop anyone or any institution or agency that thinks it is able to deliver employment services from bidding to provide those under the Job Network. There will be a new Job Network tender in about two years timeless, in fact; I think in about 18 months time-but this issue of job matching payments and how we try to ensure fairness is certainly one that I have under review, one on which I do not believe we have necessarily reached the last word on optimal outcomes. So he makes a fair point. It is something that I am conscious of and something I hope the Job Network can tackle better in the years to come. I will finish with a remark that might apply to a number of the contributions that have been made by members opposite. I have a great deal of faith in the integrity of Job Network members. While they are only human and while it is true that junior Job Network member staff may well, life being what it is, sometimes get impatient with people, sometimes categorise people unfairly and sometimes perhaps write people off too soon, at the end of the day we have only a certain amount of resources and we need to invest them in the most sensible possible ways, and some job seekers are very hard to help. That does not mean that we should not do our absolute best, but it is right and proper that we should make intelligent decisions about the best way to invest those resources. I think that is best done at the local level by organisations that know the job seekers, know the communities and know the employment circumstances of those particular areas. Certainly I say to the member for Oxley and to anyone else in the parliament who is concerned about this: if you honestly believe that a particular constituent of yours is not getting a 28182 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 fair go from the Job Network, talk to the relevant Job Network member, tell them that you think this individual is not getting a fair go and, if you do not think that the Job Network member has responded adequately, maybe talk to another Job Network member. If there is a problem with getting someone who is on Intensive Assistance with one institution, and is not getting on very well, transferred to a different agency, that is the sort of thing ministers can sometimes help with, and it is the sort of thing that departments can sometimes look at. Job seekers will do better and our society will be enriched if we have as much communication as possible. I accept that there will always be ideological and philosophical differences between governments and members of the opposition, but there is no reason whatsoever why we cannot come to good practical arrangements to the benefit of our own people. As I said, I would certainly encourage members opposite who believe that individuals are not getting a fair go to make contact with the Job Network, the department and, if necessary, my office and we will see what we can do to help. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of the Environment and Heritage Proposed expenditure, $743,095,000. parliamentarians sitting here and those who may be listening to this debate page 103 of Budget Paper No. 2. It covers the particular area I am interested in, and that is the Department of Environment and Heritage allocation in 2001-02 of $5 million. I quote the explanation: The Government will provide a grant of up to $5 million in 2001-02 to the Goondiwindi Town Council to develop a recreational facility at Serpentine Lagoon, Goondiwindi. The facility is needed because Boobera Lagoon is to be closed to current facilities as a result of a declaration of protection under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. The new facility will satisfy relevant Commonwealth, state and local legislative requirements. I raise that and use it possibly as a vehicle for what I am going to say because I was very disturbed-not that I am denying these people the right to have this money allocated to them, even though I admit and acknowledge that it is in the seat of the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, the Hon. Bruce Scott. I had an opportunity on Saturday, 9 June, with our council-the Fairfield City Council-and accompanied by the mayor, Councillor Robert Watkins, to launch a five-creek strategic plan in Fairfield. One may ask, ‘What are you doing launching a five-creek strategic plan in Fairfield City Council?’ After all, it is a metropolitan council so how has it got five creeks? Well, within our area we happen to have the Prospect Creek Catchment area, which covers approximately 98 square kilometres and includes the following five creeks: Prospect Creek, Orphan School Creek, Clear Paddock Creek, Green Valley Creek, Burns Creek and even part of Long Creek. There are something like 2,500 flood affected properties, and I will speak in another area of debate about that. But they are looking at the waterways, the catchments, sewer outfalls and modified and affected fauna habitat. I have brought it up because this council has been able to put a plan into place with no assistance whatsoever from this Commonwealth government. When we look at all the allocation of funds and all the uses for it, that one in particular, I believe, sticks out like a sore thumb. I am particularly proud of what the council have been able to do and I praise them for being such an innovative and progressive council, particularly where urban creek restoration is concerned. I was particularly pleased too that they brought in a cultural mapping group-a placebo art group-which is the first time it has ever been done, I understand, in an area such as ours. These people went to individual schools, factories, clubs or whatever that in any way, shape or form were involved in creeks and got the residents to come along and design with them what they, the residents, would like to see around the creeks in our area. That is what",153,Representatives Main Committee
309,Mrs Crosio (Prospect) (11.00 A.m.),"I rise this morning to bring to the attention of theWednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28183 came to the forefront in the launching of the strategic plan-funding not provided by any government department but through the ratepayers and by the council itself. The strategic plan launched on that Saturday is part of an evolving approach for those five creeks and it is being seen and treated by our community as what we would like to see in the future. The creeks, we know, are changing all the time, and I believe this plan will continue to evolve and change. But I then wonder-and bring to the attention of the House-how much more could be done. I am using my council as an example because they at least have taken the bit between the teeth and have gone ahead and said, ‘Look, we have got an environment problem here. We have got a problem that needs fixing. We certainly applied to the relevant government departments for funding; that hasn’t been forthcoming, but our community is saying that more needs to be done.’ Possibly 100 years ago European settlers did all their boating and picnicking in this catchment creek area-and I should imagine that our first indigenous settlers used it as a lifeline to support themselves-and yet today we are seeing growth, pollutants and the degradation of a local environment area. A council is willing to start restoring it, but how much more could have been done if they had even a part of that $5 million that has been allocated to one lagoon. If we are realistically looking at allocating our taxpayers funds, let us look Australia wide as well. I could go on further about what is happening with the natural heritage allocations. People may ask, ‘Why didn’t you get some of that money?’ Well, that did not go too far in our area either, and there is certainly nothing I can point to in saying how great that is going to be as part of the contribution for an electorate like mine that probably has in the vicinity of 200,000 people and yet we are very limited as far as funds are concerned. I say to the Fairfield City Council and to their mayor: keep up the good work. To the staff and all those people who were involved in putting the strategic plan together, I say: you are to be commended and congratulated. I believe that this is the beginning of what we are going to be so very proud of in the future. More importantly, we have finally seen a local government area get together in saying, ‘We have a concern; we have a problem; let’s now start to rectify it and change it and, more importantly, change people’s perceptions of what our creeks are all about.’ (Time expired). this year’s budget for an extension of the Natural Heritage Trust. I said at the time of the budget that it appeared to be a smoke and mirrors exercise which appeared to shift money from other, established environment programs and re-badge them as new initiatives. Apart from the interest generated from the minimum legislated balance of the trust-that is $300 million-it is just not enough to even begin to tackle the $60 billion price tag that the National Farmers’ Federation and the Australian Conservation Council place on the repair bill for the Murray-Darling Basin alone. Unless we find alternative sources of funds to selling off Telstra, our environmental efforts are doomed to fail. I believe we need a levy such as that recently suggested by a committee of this parliament, as an environmental tax-let us be frank and call it what it is-and we need policies that seriously encourage investment in alternative energy. We cannot even commit to a Kyoto greenhouse target that we had already doubly exceeded by 1997-98. How absolutely pathetic is that, and what a betrayal of our future generations it is, if we do not put in place some meaningful targets and some meaningful long-term policies. I well remember in the debate during the sale of the first tranche of Telstra, the former shadow minister-later minister-Ian McLachlan was in the House, and I said then that the Murray-Darling Basin 2001 program was indeed a Murray-Darling Basin 2101 program, if we were going to be realistic about it. In a quiet chat afterwards with him he totally agreed.",156,Representatives Main Committee
310,Mr Andren (Calare) (11.05 A.m.),"Much was made of the extra $1 billion set aside in28184 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 That is the dimension of the program, and the challenge that we have ahead of us, in that sector of the Australian environment alone. If we are to be a clever nation and an innovative one, then we have an opportunity to apply it to the most pressing crisis that faces the globe. It is the environment, and Australia is ideally placed to be the engine room, if you like, of innovation in terms of environmental studies and environmental options. We do not even know what our supposed carrying capacity is in this country, and while there are many anxious to say we have got enough in this country, that we need to protect our environment, we must remember those millions of people who are on the subcontinent and China. Imagine once all the Chinese put down their bikes and hop into motor cars-which many of them will do in the next few years-what an enormous impact on our greenhouse contribution that will be. We really need to be quite objective about this. If it means that we do stretch our environmental capabilities in order to perhaps take pressure off elsewhere, we should look at that. We should look at what we need in terms of infrastructure to handle larger populations in regional Australia. But we should start doing it now, in a serious way, and not leave it for perhaps the next generation, the next term of parliament, the government after this or whatever it might be. Of course, the Australian public, not only us as legislators, as a parliament, have a role to play here. I notice in Ross Gittins’s article in the Herald today that Australians say the environment is important, but they are not prepared to even commit to green energy. I suggest part of this is a failure to understand how the existing industry can be a user of non-green resources and also be a promoter of green energy. It strikes me that there needs to be a completely separate supplier that the consumer can recognise as an independent broker of green energy and not one involved in chewing up our resources to create the non-green energy that we rely on. I know we rely on it, and we have to accept that. In my own small, modest way I am trying to encourage ADI in Lithgow. They assemble generators and equipment for wind power generation. (Extension of time granted) I know that ADI are involved in assembling wind power generators from overseas in one of their Victorian plants. I think it would be a very creative move for ADI, with government support and encouragement, to develop that technology in a place like Lithgow where we already have the beginnings of a wind power industry supported by the existing energy infrastructure in the area, to develop these alternative energies and the jobs, creativity and IT that go with them alongside our traditional energy sources-the coal mines. Then the children of the miners can move into the new energy that has to develop over the next couple of decades. If we do not do that, we will sit on our hands and leave our kids with an environment that I know my young fellow, at 19 or 20, agonises over-not as an activist or anything else-as to what we can do to turn the ship of old energy around and to really do something positive. He believes-and I certainly do-that Australia is in a prime position to create that expertise. April on my concerns about the level of greenhouse gas emissions. I have spoken about climate change-in short, global warming-and the failure of the government to deal appropriately with the Kyoto protocol because of the position of the United States government, primarily President George Bush. It was very heartening for environmentalists to view the images which came to our screens last week, when President Bush travelled to Europe, and the outrage that was expressed by Europeans on behalf of all people on this planet who have grave concerns about the level of greenhouse gas emissions that are being spewed out on mother earth on a daily basis. The Australian government should be taking a greater stand against the position of the United States. I do not believe that Senator Hill is doing enough. It is just not good enough for us to blame the US. The US seems to have the view that the economy is far more important",157,Representatives Main Committee

Quite honestly, if you do not have an environment, you do not have an economy. Global warming is the most serious environmental issue facing us today and Australia should be showing greater leadership in speaking out against the behaviour of President Bush. I have wondered many times what would have happened had Al Gore won the last election. Al Gore is a very outspoken environmentalist who has grave concerns for the future of this planet. Unfortunately, he missed out on being elected as President of the United States of America. It seems that Mr Bush’s cabinet is stacked with oil, lead and aluminium business executives who are motivated only by economic imperatives and not by the consequences of global warming on the environment. I take this opportunity to send a strong message on behalf of the many constituents in my electorate of Lowe who have expressed grave reservations about the weak-kneed approach of Senator Hill in not standing up to President Bush. He should be encouraged to take a tougher stand. Unless more countries take on the United States in the interests of saving the planet, as obviously the Europeans are prepared to do, the United States of America will continue to be concerned only with economic imperatives and we would all pay a great price for that. Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (11.16 a.m.)-In summing up the debate, I thank the members for Calare, Lowe and Prospect for their contributions. It is very important that we consider that this government’s environmental credentials are under scrutiny, both domestically and internationally, just as all governments’ environmental credentials and investments now are. We have a new consciousness that, for the first time in history, there are more environmental refugees around the globe than there are refugees created by war. That is the case for the first time in human history. We see water resources running down or being polluted across the globe, and we see issues like climate change through human intervention, which is a very serious issue and is now acknowledged to be something that all nations must address most urgently. I will come to the issue of climate change that the member for Lowe and the member for Calare addressed. To begin with the member for Prospect’s contribution, she was concerned about the five-creek strategic plan in her electorate. It sounds like a very commendable plan, and I add my congratulations to hers for an effort well done by her councils. She was concerned that they were going it alone, so to speak-that they did not seem to have been tapping into Natural Heritage Trust funding. Let me say to her that we have been very conscious of urban environments and the degradation of water supplies, air quality and noise abatement. There is a whole range of urban environmental issues that the Natural Heritage Trust specifically identified and addressed. In the vast majority of cases the natural resource issues that we have to address are in regional and remote Australia, but there are, too, of courseMrs Crosio-In marginal seats, more like it. funding, including urban Waterwatch, under the Living Cities program. The Commonwealth announced in the 2000-01 budget statement an amount of over $12 million over three years for the urban Waterwatch program in order to improve the health of urban waterways through community monitoring in urban areas. As a result of budget requirements, the urban Waterwatch component of the Living Cities program was reallocated. I say to the councils who are involved with the five-creek strategic plan that they should talk to Environment Australia and explore those specific NHT programs. They should also talk to Environment Australia, to me specifically or to DETYA about Green Corps. We have put $88.8 million into the Green Corps program across Australia. A significant number of those wonderful young Australians, aged between 17 and 20, who are involved in Green Corps work in urban catchments, just like the catchment the member for Prospect described.",158,Representatives Main Committee

Green Corps engages with other service groups or voluntary groups in the community. Green Corps is a magnificent program, one we are very pleased to see has been taken up very enthusiastically across the country. The budget for that Green Corps program is substantial. I commend the Green Corps project to the member for Prospect to pursue, as well as the Work for the Dole programs, which have seen numbers of individuals and teams of people who have dedicated their efforts in a voluntary capacity to programs of renewal of urban streams or other open places. Again, it just might be that the councils in the member for Prospect’s electorate are not fully aware of those opportunities, and I commend those to them. Let me assure you that our environmental budget does pay a very substantial amount of attention to urban issues, in terms of both climateMrs Crosio-We have knocked on every door, Parliamentary Secretary. tary, I am able to help people just like your five-creek plan group on very many occasions. Of course, the realities are that it is always a competitive process but, as you describe it, this is a very worthy project. I will refer to the member for Calare’s contribution. (Extension of time granted) I agree that we certainly have had the NFF and the ACF make a substantial attempt to quantify just what a repair bill for the Australian environment could be. I think the NFF-ACF estimated $3.7 billion a year for 10 years as a minimum. The point of course is that this government have put more funding specifically into environmental repair and natural resource conservation and protection than any other government in the history of Australia. We began in 1996, needing to look at where to find those funds since we inherited a deficit, as the member for Calare would be only too aware, and we were able to have a win-win situation by partially privatising Telstra and using those funds to retire a lot of inherited debt and to invest in the Natural Heritage Trust. The good news is that, by very careful management of our economy, the Howard government are now able to go beyond simply relying on the proceeds of sale of some assets. With five years of surplus budgets we have now been able to draw our environmental funding from consolidated revenue. That is exactly how we hoped it would be, but we could not wait until we got the deficit down before we were able to commit billions of dollars. We could not wait for the surplus; hence, we began in 1996, as we did. The member for Calare was concerned that, as he said, we do not even know what the carrying capacity of the country is. We could have waited five years for the National Land and Water Resources Audit to do that base study work-we are now beginning to get excellent outcomes from the investment in their research and development; they have just recently produced audits of salinity and water quality in our country-but we felt that we could not wait five years for that work to be done, so we commenced in 1996 understanding the scale of the problem and understanding the level of expenditure that needed to be undertaken as soon as possible. We are doing two things: we are investing in on-the-ground work to make sure our agricultural production is sustainable and our natural resources protected and, at the same time, we are doing that research and development work that is needed so we can monitor and assess what we have achieved and whether we are heading in the right direction so we can understand the scope and the scale of the problem that is with us now and which is going to continue as we continue to be naturally resource based in many parts of our economy. The member for Lowe was understandably concerned, like most Australians, about the issue of climate change and how our government is responding to our responsibilities as one of the world’s highest per capita emitters of carbon. He suggested, I think, that our Prime Minister, John Howard, had somehow not done enough. Then he went on to acknowledge that this",159,Representatives Main Committee
313,Dr Stone,"Please come and knock on my door as well because, as parliamentary secreWednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28187 is an issue that requires international cooperation, and the difficulty is now with a USA administration which does not share the same level of commitment to Kyoto that was exhibited in the previous administration. Our country, Australia, leads the world in dedication of funds to greenhouse gas abatement. We have the world’s first national greenhouse office. We have put over a billion dollars into long-term work which includes research into alternative energy sources and helping industry commercialise alternative energy technologies. The member for Calare will be interested in that too, because that was one of his concerns. We are very realistic and, as our minister has said in the Senate in response to questions about how we are going to cope with the fact that the United States is not as concerned about progressing the Kyoto agreement as the previous administration, we are acknowledging that it is going to be very difficult. We are continuing to support the Kyoto protocol moving forward and being accepted. (Extension of time granted) In particular, we are concerned that developing countries participate in identifying the issues and finding solutions to the problem because we know that in the very near future developing countries will have significantly more emissions than developed countries. We are in the process of further negotiation on the implementation of the protocol. There is no go-slow; there is no sitting on our hands. We are pressing forward as hastily as we can, given the current political circumstances that are in the community of those addressing these problems. I am very proud that it was our government, the Australian government, that put on the table at Kyoto discussions on the issue of vegetation: the significance of carbon sequestration and carbon sinks using vegetation. That was one of the first serious discussions about the role of vegetation and its retention, in that global forum, and now Australia is very much respected for the work that we have done in that regard. I think Senator Hill needs to be commended for the work that he is doing. Certainly our government has put our money where our mouth is in terms of significant commitment to the Australian Greenhouse Office and the range of programs that go with that. In conclusion, let me say that Australia has a very significant problem as a consequence of the last 250 or so years of management of our natural resources. They have not always led to the most sustainable outcomes. We understand that. We are learning, now, how to manage this country in a way so that our future generations are not going to inherit a degraded water supply or air pollution standards which leave many sick with asthma. We understand the needs of our Bureau of Meteorology. That has been significantly funded in an ongoing fashion. We understand our responsibilities in the Antarctic. We are one of the first countries in the world to have an oceans policy and to persist in making sure that our endangered species are protected. Therefore, I am proud to be a part of the Howard government that has been, as I said, the first in the history of Australia to commit the level of funding that now is dedicated to the environment. I am quite sure that the community of Australia is with us in understanding that this level of investment is essential for our futures. Trust and the Howard government’s initiative in repairing the environment and how significant that has been in the electorate of Mitchell. I will mention some of the things that have flowed from the decisions for funding community organisations and the scope that the trust funds have used in sustainable development, in sustainable alternative agricultural techniques and in the retention of biodiversity in the plant and animal life of the huge area which surrounds the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment areas. Community groups in the Blue Mountains, in the electorate of my colleague Kerry Bartlett, and in the electorates of Lindsay, Macarthur, Mitchell, Berowra and Robertson, have been most anxious to take up the advantages of further repairing and restoring the environment.",160,Representatives Main Committee
314,Mr Cadman (Mitchell) (11.28 A.m.),"I want to raise the issue of the Natural Heritage28188 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 As the development of Sydney presses out into the Hawkesbury valley, we are finding that there is increasing pressure on the environment. Greater care is needed to ensure the health of the Hawkesbury River, to make sure that the blue-green algae bloom that occurs on a fairly regular basis in that river is contained, that fish life is preserved and that the water quality in the Hawkesbury is retained. Unfortunately, a recent decision by Mr Amery, the state minister, to abandon the main funding mechanism, the Hawkesbury-Nepean Catchment Management Trust, means that there is no organisation that is capable of receiving the funds and making decisions on resource allocation as to how the federal government should apply the Natural Heritage Trust funds. I do not know how it is going to work. The decision by Amery to wipe out this organisation, which was established by my colleague Mr Kevin Rozzoli, was incredible. It is an organisation which has served the people of Western Sydney extremely well. It has focused on water quality retention and it drew together instrumentalities such as the water board and five or six local government bodies which have fought and failed to take action to retain or improve the health of the river. In fact, Mr Amery, with one stroke of the pen, dismissed this group. Mrs Crosio interjectingtalking about the destruction of the environment of the Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers. I stand alongside my colleagues in the state house who seek an inquiry as to why this organisation has been disbanded. You have left the Commonwealth without any mechanism to fund or make priorities in that area. The member who has interrupted is from Western Sydney. She knows jolly well there is no replacement body. She knows that to fund Penrith City Council, Hawkesbury City Council or those sorts of bodies is a piecemeal approach. She knows that the Hawkesbury-Nepean Catchment Management Trust was the only body capable of administering these funds and making the right priority decisions. It is a most appalling decision. I believe that there should be an upper house inquiry. I appeal to the parliamentary secretary to use her powers of persuasion with her state colleagues. We will certainly, from this level, be seeing what alternative funding processes can be used. I believe an inquiry should be conducted to assess the impact of the trust’s closure on the environment, the effectiveness of the trust’s work in improving the health of the catchment and whether government activities have affected the trust’s functions. I suspect that the trust has been critical of the government’s decision to expand development and housing on the former ADI site. The trust says this is environmental sacrilege and it should never happen. The trust has been sacked because it opposed the development policies of the New South Wales government.

321,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Resume your seat. The member for ProspectWednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28189 I have called the member for Prospect to order. The parliamentary secretary now has the call. Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (11.35 a.m.)-I thank the member for Mitchell for his final remarks. As you understand, I was closing the debate just before he spoke; he would not have realised that. Let me say that the member for Mitchell raised some significant issues. He highlighted the fact that in natural resource management we need cooperation between jurisdictions, whether it is local councils or state or federal governments. One of the problems of federation has been that the Commonwealth government alone does not have the ability to legislate across the country for setting national standards or requiring natural resource management activities to take place in states or territories. In fact, the Natural Heritage Trust has been groundbreaking in the bilateral agreements developed with the states and will continue to be groundbreaking as we develop stateCommonwealth bilateral agreements for our new national salinity action plan. Where something breaks down, as it seems to have done in the Hawkesbury River, we need to work very seriously with the state government again and, for the good of the environment, make sure we have the optimal outcome. I am sure that, with the local community understanding the impacts of what has gone on, we will get some of that cooperation back into the system quite quickly because otherwise the environment will be significantly damaged. I thank the member for Mitchell for his contribution and I am pleased to commend the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2001-2002 to the House and particularly to the Department of the Environment and Heritage. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Transport and Regional Services Proposed expenditure, $503,678,000. under this area of responsibility. I am pleased the minister is here to hear them. FirstI would like to touch on the Western Sydney Orbital. I have had questions on notice-and I know a number of my other colleagues have as well-looking at classifications of national highways and tolls. At least the minister has acknowledged that no other national highway in Australia is going to have a toll on it as this one will. I am rather displeased about this. If you look at Western Sydney and where we are geographically located, you will see that we will now have something like four roads with tolls on them, and here is one that is going to be a so-called bypass. A lot of the traffic lights and signals are now in existence, particularly along the Cumberland Highway. But it is going to be at a cost to the residents that I represent. In fact, when I asked the minister, in a question without notice, what the cost would be, in his reply he indicated that electronic tolling is proposed, although not finally decided on-that is to be addressed in the tender process-but it is likely that a toll of about 25c per kilometre would be charged up to a maximum of about $5, in year 2000 dollars. This road will eventually be finished by about 2008 and 2010. I know the minister will probably get up and say that residents have a right to use other roads and they do not have to use this one. But, if they choose to use this one because they want to get to work quicker, they are going to have to pay in the vicinity of the equivalent of $5 in year 2000 dollars. When we look at expenditure reviews and costings of the future, they could be paying anything up to $10 a journey going each way. I think that is far more than they could afford to pay. More particularly, it is most",162,Representatives Main Committee

324,Mr Deputy Speaker,I remind the member for Sturt that I have called him to order.,163,Representatives Main Committee
325,Mrs Crosio (Prospect) (11.37 A.m.),"There are a number of issues I would like to raise28190 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 unfair that a road that is going to be built in Western Sydney is going to have a toll while other so-called national highways do not. Another area of concern with the orbital-I put a submission in on this because an environmental impact statement was issued-was Horsley Drive, which goes right through the centre of my electorate. That was originally classified as a road that was only going to be a feeder road in the future, but the traffic volumes indicated by the EIS show that when the orbital is built off Wallgrove Drive, Horsley Drive east of the proposal will have a 51 per cent increase in traffic over the volume of traffic now using it. If anyone cares to use that road during what is classified as a busy time, particularly coming to the Cumberland Highwaygoing east or then going west-they will find that between the hours of 7 a.m. to 9.30 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 5.30 or 6 p.m. it is actually a parking station: we cannot move on it now. There is no money allocated or even a desire at this stage to make that a four-lane expressway to feed these tollways or orbital roads. This is a residential road and it is going to go right through an area where certainly the council does not have the responsibility but I know the state government does. I am not worrying so much about the funding for that but I am concerned about traffic volume. In fact, people have always been told that that was going to be an internal feeder road throughout the municipality, which is now the city, and that it certainly would not be affected by any future expansions. In the minister’s own words, that is now going to happen. I am also a little disturbed about the government’s ownership of the Badgerys Creek site. In answer to my question on notice-and in answer to a question on notice from my colleague the member for Lowe, who, I am sure, will have more to say about it-the minister said: The Government has decided to retain ownership of the Badgerys Creek site and to legislate to protect the site from incompatible development in surrounding areas which may prejudice its future use as an airport. The Government will further review Sydney’s airport needs in 2005. No site other than Badgerys Creek is currently being considered for a second major airport. That answer was given on 4 June 2001. I find that answer rather disconcerting when we realise now, when they are looking for the sale of Sydney airport, that they are going to have carte blanche as to whether they go ahead and build another airport, wherever it may be. Why aren’t the government honest with the people of Western Sydney? They are saying, ‘We will not have further use for that site; therefore, we are not going to require that site,’ but people in my electorate will not take that as an answer. As far as they are concerned, all we have done with Badgerys Creek is put it on hold. More importantly, we do not seem to be looking at the overall problem of what is happening in New South Wales as far as transport and transport studies go. I want to touch on that very briefly so I will come back to it later. I also want to touch on the Roads to Recovery program again. I raised this in the House in December of last year when it was reported in the papers that money being allocated to Western Sydney-$13-odd million-was all going to the electorate of Prospect. (Extension of time granted) I must admit that when I read the $13.2 million was all going to go to the electorate of Prospect, I grabbed the paper and ran round the table. However, when I looked further, I saw that it was not going to the electorate of Prospect at all. It was going to be shared by the electorates of eight colleagues and about four different councils. So the one bit of money was being recorded in the electorates of the members for Chifley, Reid, Lindsay and Greenway, in my electorate and, dare I say, in part of Parramatta and Strathfield. So when we are talking about this $13.2 million from the Roads to Recovery program that was to be expended in Western Sydney, I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there was very little we got of that. Wednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28191 In the allocation here today, I would also like to touch on flooding and flood mitigation programs. I want to bring up the flooding because of what we saw happen in 1996. When this government came to power, they set up a National Commission of Audit and used that as the excuse to cut $80 million out of all flood mitigation and urban, rural and regional communities’ programming. I understand that after intensive lobbying, probably again from some of the marginal seats, a much weaker regional flood mitigation program was reintroduced in 1999. But you have to look a bit further than that. It was reintroduced in the rural areas with much fanfare but only $20 million was put back into it over three years, again into rural towns and regional centres. I am not saying that the need is not great there, but not one penny has been allocated to urban flood mitigation programs in Western Sydney. I am glad the member for Parramatta is here, because he put out a press release stating that certain flood mitigation funding was coming to the seat of Parramatta. Of course, being ever observant, I was ready to scream, ‘Why is that money going to one particular urban area and not to the other?’ only to find that it was just a misrepresentation on the member for Parramatta’s behalf, that the money did not go there at all, that he was looking at all of this so-called extra funding coming in. Of course, it was not the case. We had the member for Mitchell talking about what is happening to the Hawkesbury River and to the catchment program there. Of course, he did not want to acknowledge who actually set it up and how it was funded. Under the Keating government, the previous Labor government, we had flood mitigation programs going on what we called 2:2:1-in other words, for every $2 from the Commonwealth, $2 was supplied by the state and $1 by local councils. That has been completely wiped. Forget that many local councils and areas like mine have $30 million worth of flood mitigation work still outstanding. I represent three particular council areas that are massively inundated when flooding occurs. Just recently, with the showers that we had, two schools had to close in my electorate. I am talking about the Patrician Brothers, which had to close its school and 1,500 kids were sent home. Shops were inundated and they had to close the doors. It all comes from urban flood mitigation problems. Councils are continuing to work on this. They are still at least getting cooperation from the state government, but there is not one cent coming any more from this federal government. If we are talking about needs and responsibilities, with respect to the heritage funding, the parliamentary secretary who spoke previously talked about paving new ways of doing things and going in new directions. I say: what was wrong with some of the old directions? If you want a job done, what is wrong with bringing state and local government money into it? If you want a job done in the urban areas, then certainly it needs Commonwealth funding. There are some tremendous problems happening now because of the residential build-up in areas. In fact, when I spoke previously about the environment and creeks, one of the reasons we are looking at using another method to clear floodways and clean up the creek system is to assist and help in flood mitigation programs. It boils down to the fact that flooding comes without warning. If we do not take action prior to flooding, then for the people who are going to be affected in the long term, it is going to be a lot more costly to overcome. In our area we have been raising houses so that they are above the flood mitigation levels. People could say that in the fifties and sixties they should never have been given consent to build there, but try to tell that to people when they have bought their land in good faith and they have built their house on it. What we are doing there in regard to flood mitigation is to raise those houses so that at least people’s lives and properties are not damaged when those creeks flood. This is part of the Georges River and Prospect Creek management. 28192 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 We have not had one penny allocated by this government since they came to power in 1996, following that national audit excuse which was used to cut out the $80 million funding. It is all very well to have lobbying by rural and regional areas, even though they are getting a paltry amount of money-$20 million over three years is not going to fix one iota of the concerns and problems that rural and regional centres have. (Extension of time granted) More particularly, I say to the government: you have to look realistically at where we are going. They cannot stand here preaching on the one hand about how great they are on the environment, having regard to the Natural Heritage Trust, and selling off all the family silver by way of Telstra, without taking into account on the other hand programs that were in place, programs that were doing a good job, programs that were working, with the cooperation of the local and state governments, and at least putting the money inGovernment members interjectingmembers should be heard in silence.

I will continue to talk on what I have been talking about, flood mitigation. I am glad the member for Mitchell has come into the Main Committee because I will be able to go to his councils and say that he got up and objected to my statement that the Commonwealth government needs to fund, through the state governments and local councils, further flood mitigation in Western Sydney. It will give me great delight to inform the councils that he represents that he objects to me stating that, if we are going to give consideration to adequate funding, we have to look not at the $20 million being spent over three years in rural and regional Australia but at what is happening with the flood mitigation program, where $80 million was wiped by the Howard government following that pretentious ‘national audit’ in 1996. Councils will be delighted to know that this is what the honourable member for Mitchell thinks of them and their attempts to get the flood mitigation program going-that he feels it is unjust for me to get up and bring to light during a budget debate that not one cent of the $80 million that was wiped in 1996 has been restored to this funding program. Not one cent from 1996 has been restored to urban flood mitigation. Not one cent in these budget papers or in the forward estimates for flood mitigation programs is going to be allocated in the future for Western Sydney. As the honourable member for Mitchell knows-and we have been involved in a number of projects both with the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils and with the councils that we represent-one of the largest cries from councils in Fairfield, Blacktown, Penrith, Baulkham Hills, Parramatta, Hawkesbury and Nepean is that this government wiped the flood mitigation program. How proud the member for Mitchell must be! He will not even get up and support a program in which the prime objective of all of the councils involvedthe 10 councils that make up the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils-is to put pressure on this government, to lobby this government through their local members of parliament, to have common sense prevail and have part of that $80 million that was taken out of the program in 1996 restored.

I think that was a far-sighted decision and one that has been on the drawing board for many years. It was the Labor Party that first investigated it but did nothing towards it. They had a line on a map and that is as far as it got. It took the arrival of this government to do the environmental studies and to make the financial commitments. This was something the Australian Labor Party could not do because they were stony-broke and in debt. Therefore, there was no way they could make a commitment of the type-with the vision-that this government has made.",166,Representatives Main Committee

I say to the minister-and I know the members for Robertson and Berowra would agree-that the areas we represent would be very keen to see the continuity of the project, and that there be no pause in the process. The people of our areas need to see a continuity of good management in government if they expect to see a process of bringing this to finality.

The fact is that, if we were not in government, Carl Scully would call the shots over a federal Labor transport minister, and goodness knows where that would finish up. It would be a great crime to see the project half finished. With respect to transport issues, I also want to raise Sydney airport and the slot scheme discussion paper that has been put out. On behalf of residents in my area, I inform the minister that we have seen a very vocal group of people who are conscious of Sydney’s airport needs and noise pollution, and who are based around the inner city suburbs. On behalf of the residents of outer suburbs, who are also affected, I would like to thank him for entering into this slot scheme discussion, because I think that the scheme has merits, and residents in the electorate of Mitchell see great merit in the proposals. They say that the enforcement of curfews and hourly capping is an advantage. They refer also to making more uniform in time the movements in and out of Sydney, and making sure that the number of aircraft will not increase, by encouraging larger aircraft to cater for the inevitable increase in passenger numbers and encouraging some regional flights to bypass Sydney. However, they are seeking information about possible flight paths in and out of Bankstown and the way in which Bankstown may be used. They are also concerned that the handling of movements for Bankstown has not been made public at this point. I have informed them that, in my opinion, the Bankstown decision is certainly the best of those available. Certainly, Badgerys Creek was not an option, but moving towards the use of Bankstown is a very good decision in a long-term, measured way, with the proviso-and I know the Leader of the National Party of Australia understands this-that nobody in rural New South Wales should be disadvantaged. That is an absolutely golden proviso because people in regional areas have, I believe, equal rights to those of people living in urban areas, and they must be looked after in those terms. It is okay for people travelling between Sydney and Melbourne to say that they want to run the airlines their way, but the protection of regional services is vital. (Time expired) Ms HOARE (Charlton) (11.58 a.m.)-I take this brief opportunity to talk about a road project in my electorate of Charlton which missed out on funding in this budget. Following the budget, the Australian Local Government Association put out a media release which criticised the Commonwealth for its failure to address the serious shortfall in national road funding. The President of the Local Government Association, Councillor Ross, stated: ... Australia’s degraded road infrastructure still requires substantial and sustained additional funding, well beyond the measures ... announced over recent months. He was talking about the Roads to Recovery program. He continued:",167,Representatives Main Committee

Indeed, the forward estimates released today show that by 2004-2005, total road funding will fall by 25% in real terms,” ... At the beginning of this year the Mayor of the City of Lake Macquarie wrote to me seeking my support for Commonwealth government funding approval for the integrated transport strategy, under the Roads to Recovery program. He stated: Lake Macquarie is the largest regional centre North of Sydney, and acts in a pivotal role as the gateway to the Hunter. This project will provide an important part of an essential arterial route, to improve connections from the Hunter Region’s largest employment zone, to the National Highway and the Port of Newcastle. The Newcastle and Hunter Business Chamber views the project as one of regional significance within their regional infrastructure Strategic Plan, and therefore have endorsed the project. I wrote to the minister at the table supporting this proposal and the application for funding under the program. The council applied specifically for funding for a project under the Roads of National Importance program. The Lake Macquarie City Council has proposed an integrated transport strategy as an important infrastructure project for the Hunter region and is seeking Commonwealth funding assistance. It has also proposed that funding of $26 million will come from the New South Wales government and $1.4 million from council. The funding for the planning of the new railway station and transport interchange was announced in the New South Wales state budget. The project is a major infrastructure development for the Hunter region and will generate job growth, improve access to public transport and provide environmental benefits for Lake Macquarie. In the past 10 years in excess of 1,000 new employment positions have been created in Lake Macquarie, most within the Cardiff Industrial Park in my electorate of Charlton. It is proposed that the estate be expanded and further developed. The industrial area houses major transport firms, such as John Farragher Transport and Logistics, and Powerdown Australia, a major manufacturer and exporter of bus chassis. However, businesses are hindered by treacherous and inefficient road links to the F3 freeway. Lake Macquarie City Council’s proposed integrated transport strategy will alleviate this problem. The Hunter region has suffered significantly following the closure of BHP and the downturn in our manufacturing industry. I believe this proposal will greatly assist the maintenance and extension of employment opportunities in the region. I supported the application for funding under the Roads to Recovery program for the Lake Macquarie integrated transport centre and I recommended it to the minister for his favourable consideration. The City of Lake Macquarie is one of the fastest growing areas in New South Wales. It is centred on Australia’s largest coastal lake and is flanked by both mountains and the Pacific Ocean. It has unique environmental and economic potential to become one of the most desirable areas in which to live in Australia. As the city’s role as a major urban and tourism centre develops, our challenge is to realise this potential by providing and improving facilities to encourage and facilitate economic growth within the Hunter region. Today, its population of 185,000 and work force of 96,000 are major economic drivers in the Hunter region. The Lake Macquarie integrated transport centre is an infrastructure project that addresses job creation, improves road safety and increases public transport accessibility for a large proportion of Lake Macquarie and western Newcastle residents, and provides improved access to the national highway and the port of Newcastle. I understand that the mayor and the general manager of the city met with Senator Ian Macdonald earlier this year and held discussions with him. However, we are yet to get a response from the minister about the funding of this nationally important project. 28196 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 particular, the $80 million which has been allocated to the F3 freeway. I am very pleased that the Deputy Prime Minister is in the chamber today, and I record the thanks of the thousands of Central Coast commuters who regularly use the F3 freeway. It is the main road transport link between the Central Coast and Sydney. I heard the member opposite speaking about the rapidly expanding area of Lake Macquarie, and, of course, for that area the only main road transport link to Sydney is the F3. When I was first elected to parliament in 1996, I was shocked to hear that the previous Labor government had done absolutely no forward planning with regard to the F3, despite the fact that it was the most heavily trafficked road in New South Wales and that it was obvious that the surrounding areas were expanding rapidly. SoI was behind the eight ball when I was elected. I made a commitment to the people of the Central Coast that I would do everything I could to ensure that funding was made available. Certainly, when the coalition government were elected we found that there was virtually no money in the bank. We had to address the huge deficit that the Labor Party had left us. We worked hard on that, and now we can start to return some of that money to the Australian community in the form of better roads through the Roads to Recovery program in projects such as the F3. I have to record my anger with, and disgust at, some of the actions of the New South Wales government in relation to this funding. Firstly, their roads minister, Mr Scully, when we announced this money, said ‘Oh well, it’s not enough; there should be more.’ Then he had the audacity to say that the money was not available now and would not be available until 2004. The money is available today. If the RTA can get their act together, can get their planning done and can get their costings done, we can start widening the freeway by the end of the year. But the Labor Party continue this campaign of misinformation. Only today I have received a letter that a constituent received from the Labor Party candidate in Robertson who continues this myth that the money is not available and that it will not be available until 2002 or 2004. It is totally untrue. Already the Deputy Prime Minister has written to the New South Wales government assuring them that that money is available. In fact, on 24 May 2001 the Prime Minister wrote to the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr. I will read some of that letter into Hansard: My dear PremierI am writing to you concerning Commonwealth funding for widening of the F3 Freeway between the Hawkesbury River and Calga. It is reported that the NSW Minister for Transport, the Hon Carl Scully MP, has claimed that the Commonwealth Government is holding up funding for this project. These reported statements by Mr Scully refer to the absence of Commonwealth allocation to the F3 for 2001-02. I am advised that the absence of an allocation in the coming year reflects advice from the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority that commencement of the widening project would need to await substantial planning and environmental assessment work. In relation to this, I would point out that the Commonwealth has today received a request from the RTA for preconstruction funding of $2 million in 2001-02 and this has been approved pending submission of a formal project proposal report. The last paragraph of this letter could not be clearer. This is from the Prime Minister of Australia to Premier Carr: I wish to assure you that the Commonwealth funding of $80 million will flow as soon as construction starts. If it starts this year, funding will flow this year. I would ask therefore that you instruct your transport Minister to begin construction work by the end of this calendar year.",168,Representatives Main Committee
345,Mr Lloyd (Robertson) (12.03 P.m.),"I welcome the Roads to Recovery package and, inWednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28197 That is very clear. It is very plain. It is what the commuters of the Central Coast of New South Wales want. It is what they are demanding. I am demanding that the RTA get their act together, that the minister makes sure that his department get their act together and that they get their planning in place so that they can start construction of that urgently needed widening of the F3 freeway between Calga and the Hawkesbury River so that the commuters of the Central Coast will not continue to suffer the constant delays that they now suffer simply because of traffic congestion. Every peak hour the traffic delays are considerable. Particularly on Friday evenings delays can be up to half an hour or an hour-not through any accident but just through the sheer volume of traffic coming down from three lanes to two lanes at Mount White. As a community we have worked hard for five years to secure this funding. The funding is there now. It is the responsibility of the New South Wales government and the RTA to start the construction, to start the widening, this year. speech I made in the longer debate which was somewhat truncated. This issue, the lack of an infrastructure program in this country, impacts greatly on regional Australia. I am disappointed to see that one key recommendation, recommendation 6 of the report called Time running out by this parliament’s regional affairs and primary industry committee, of which I am a member, has yet to be acted upon. It calls for the establishment of a national infrastructure advisory council with expertise from public and private sectors to facilitate the efficient and equitable provision of national infrastructure. At the moment infrastructure planning is largely marked by short-term politics and adhocery. One only has to look at the SydneyCanberra VFT project or, indeed, the Adelaide-Darwin rail line to see start-stop planning and ill-directed funding largely based on political considerations rather than nation building purposes. I am glad that the National Party now wants to own the Parkes Inland Marketing Corporation project. A few years back it did not even wish to honour a 1996 election undertaking to fund a feasibility study. Another issue that has received scant attention from the National Party is the plan jointly promoted by the Central Regional Organisation of Councils and the Institute of Chartered Accountants for regional enterprise zones. If there has been any movement on this front in the last few weeks I would be interested if the minister could bring that to my attention. I attended a seminar organised by CENTROC in Cowra late last year. It detailed the potential for targeted assistance zones. We heard from a former aide to the Clinton administration about just how effectively the United States has used such a system to promote growth in many of its less naturally endowed rural areas. Declaration as an enterprise zone would be available to areas experiencing economic distress, particularly those experiencing high unemployment. The Commonwealth government would assist the zones through wage subsidies and tax concessions, and the institute assures me that the proposed arrangements are constitutionally valid. The study, which was launched by CENTROC and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in April this year here in Parliament House, called for a parliamentary taskforce to develop targeted incentives for regional Australia, with this work to be completed by September this year. I would like to know whether that deadline has been acknowledged by the government, and whether any positive process has been put in place to address that call. I understand the opposition has indicated some sort of commitment to the concept, but I look forward to both the opposition and the government officially spelling out any commitment in the weeks and months ahead. Such a commitment would, I suggest, require a quantum shift from government about its role in economic development, and a recognition that the free market alone",170,Representatives Main Committee
346,Mr Andren (Calare) (12.08 P.m.),"I want to move to an issue that was part of the28198 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 does not deliver opportunity and jobs equally across Australia. I live in hope, remembering my first meeting of the 1996 parliament’s Primary Industries and Regional Services Committee. At that time, a senior Labor Party member seemed to suggest that regional development-and indeed rural development-inquiries should involve the committee examining the economic opportunities and problems of Newcastle, Wollongong and Geelong. It was quickly pointed out by those members from rural seats that the crisis then facing us was the future of rural and regional centres, meaning places like Tamworth, Dubbo and Lithgow. The enterprise zones have been championed by the central organisation of councils, encompassing most of the council areas in the central west of New South Wales. The inspiration for the zones has been generated and driven by Cowra Shire Council’s economic development manager, Graham Apthorpe. He recently provided me with some data from a company involved in the sad business of relocating Australian businesses offshore. In the 2000 calendar year, this company helped with the relocation of a dozen businesses to locations such as New Zealand, China, South Africa, Thailand and Sri Lanka. The businesses include a printed circuit board manufacturer, a textile manufacturer, a door manufacturer, a small electrical motor manufacturer, an air-conditioning maker and a plastics manufacturer. In recent weeks, the Canobolas wool top plant in Orange could have been added to that list. It has decided to close LWV GRRUV DW WKH HQG RI WKLV PRQWK EHFDXVH VXUSULVH VXUSULVH WKH SURGXFWLRQ RI ZRRO WRSV and scoured wool can more economically be provided from a factory in China. (Extension of time granted) People are asking how we can more proactively support that industry. I certainly have not got the answers. I know there are good examples around the country of successful wool topping and early stage value adding to wool, but it strikes me that we have a product which we are so ready to export so minutely value added that we are giving away a lot of the value of the product to people offshore, including people in Japan and, I guess, Italy. With the proper support mechanisms, we have the capacity, I think, to develop a supportable textile industry with a distinctly Australian product from paddock to coat hook. Another issue needing urgent attention, and one that seems to be placed in the too-hard basket, is the provision of a proper transport corridor across the Blue Mountains. While spending on the Roads to Recovery program is very welcome, it is the road across the mountains which is the main economic stimulus that the west of the state needs to play its share in both business coming to the west and getting its product to the markets. Along with this, we need to be looking seriously at the north-south transport links into the ports of Newcastle and Wollongong. I would love to see the submission by councils and chambers of commerce for a feasibility study into the road across the mountains, because although it was declared a RONI prior to the last election-and that was welcome-it seems to me that we are creating a major urban arterial route through the mountains. I travel it regularly, and trying to get through there on a Sunday afternoon is no mean feat, I can tell you. We have still got 60, 70 and 80 kilometres per hour zones through there and I presume we will always have them, because it is becoming a quicker route to Sydney. It seems to me that we will never have a national highway by upgrading that route. We will have an equivalent of Pennant Hills Road and probably, down the track, we will also have all of the daily commuter dramas that that road is creating in the northern suburbs of Sydney. I do not believe it is going to serve the purpose that one would hope it could, of being the major-and I think it should be national-highway through to the vast food bowl of inland New South Wales. I certainly have not got the answers, but I think that, irrespective of the fact that we now have a wonderful new World Heritage park in the Blue Mountains and Wollemi and so on, there are environmental difficulties that have to be addressed. We need to look at how we can Wednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28199 create a corridor through there-perhaps the Bell’s Line of Road-and it really does need a commitment from the state government and the necessary support from the federal government. Rail should also be looked at as part of the transport corridor through there, and it should be upgraded so that we are not putting $300,000 rigs over the mountains all the time. Perhaps a lot of the transport operators say, ‘We would prefer it if we had a roll-on, roll-off process to do our transport.’ I would be interested to hear what the minister is thinking along those lines about that particular route. Recently, the Mount Panorama motor racing circuit has become the subject of much debate in the electorate. It is something that is going to be there as a national icon long after I depart this place. It really does need to be looked at as an international circuit needing to be brought up to international sporting standards. I know that a submission looking for some form of government assistance will be coming the way of the state and federal governments in the short term. I would hope that it is looked at with a long-term vision rather than a short-term political periscope, or whatever you look at these things with. ance debate about the sale of Sydney airport and the failure of the government to deliver on its promises to fix Sydney’s aircraft noise problems fairly. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be aware, I have made many speeches on those topics, in relation to the sale of the airport and also the long-term operating plan for Sydney airport. I have also moved many motions successfully at the Sydney airport community forum. I was pleased that the minister was here a moment ago. I notice that he has walked out of the chamber, but I presume he will be coming back. I would like to start on a positive note, because I have been very critical of the government on this issue since my first speech in this House on 12 November 1998. I have been critical of the government because it is the most important local issue for my electorate. There are approximately 1,300 people in my electorate who just happen to think that a 747 droning over their home at all times of the day and night is more important to them than some of the important national issues like the implementation of the GST, education, health and other issues. In terms of this issue, I would like to start on a positive note, at least, and thank the minister for the courtesy that he has extended regarding the very numerous questions that I have placed on the Notice Paper in the time that I have been a member of this House-unlike his colleague the Minister for Health and Aged Care, who refuses to answer legitimate questions. I can say that he has answered my questions truthfully and honestly-and I am pleased the minister is walking in as I am saying this. Although, Minister, in the main I do not like the answers that you are giving me on behalf of my residents in terms of the sale of Sydney airport, the introduction of Bankstown, the shelving of Badgerys Creek and the failure to implement the long-term operating plan fairly-and I will talk about that in a moment-I do want to thank you most sincerely, on behalf of my constituents, for at least answering my questions. 3OHDVHFRQYH\WKDWWR\RXUVWDIIZKRREYLRXVO\GRTXLWHDELWRIUHVHDUFK DVP\VWDIIGRDQG as I have done, because I have spent an inordinate amount of time representing my electorate on this issue. Why? Because on almost a daily basis I get complaints to my office about aircraft noise. I would like briefly to go through the history of this issue, because under the coalition’s aviation policy of 13 February 1996, titled Soaring into tomorrow, the then Howard opposition went to the people of Australia and said, ‘We’re going to fix aircraft noise.’ In those days, certainly, aircraft noise was a very hot issue in Sydney and particularly in my electorate of Lowe. The then sitting member, Mary Easson, who was a member of the previous government, explained the implications of what the coalition was promising to visit on the people of",171,Representatives Main Committee
347,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (12.18 P.m.),"On MondayI spoke in the House during the griev28200 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 Lowe, should it be elected. That showed quite clearly what the flight paths would be. The candidate from the coalition, a member of the Liberal Party, said that this was not a Liberal Party policy-which has been shown to be false-and that the Liberal Party had the answers and that they would halve the number of planes flying over Lowe. We know that that is not the case. Very shortly after the Howard government was elected in 1996, in August 1996, the Airports Bill went through parliament. There was bipartisan support for the future sale of Sydney airport, but that was conditional on fixing the problems associated with aircraft noise. (Extension of time granted) That meant the implementation of the long-term operating plan and also a decision to be made at a future time to build a second airport for Sydney, to take the pressure off Kingsford Smith Airport. When the bill was debated in the parliament, Minister Sharp, who was in the job at that time, promised to fix the aircraft noise problems associated with Kingsford Smith Airport, and also foreshadowed the future construction of a second airport for the people of Sydney. We have subsequently learned that that debate was all about an expectation that whoever purchased that 50-year lease for Sydney airport would only have an option to build a second airport. The clear understanding, by all people who had been associated with the debate, was that the agreement to the sale of Sydney airport was on the clear understanding that a second airport would be built. That is what people effectively meant. It would appear, certainly from the campaign I have run by placing questions on the Notice Paper to try to get answers, that the government is in a position to effectively run away from the commitment to build a Sydney west airport-which is Badgerys Creek-in the foreseeable future. Why are they doing this? They are doing it simply to maximise the sale price of Sydney airport. The lease sale price, as I understand it from various reports, is about $4 billion. If the government were to require the purchaser of that lease to also build a Sydney West airport, no doubt the sale price for Sydney airport would be significantly less than $4 billion. Obviously, in this whole debate about resolving the aircraft noise problem for the people of Sydney the government are more concerned with the economic imperatives of maximising the sale price for Sydney airport and accommodating the vested and sectional interests that want to see Sydney airport stay where it is. The grave concern for my electorate, Minister, is that the expansion of Sydney airport by effectively making Bankstown airport an overflow airport-a de facto second airport, if you like-for the people of Sydney has disastrous consequences for people of the inner west, particularly my electorate. If you maximise Sydney airport you will slowly see a return to parallel runway operations and we know what the PRM is all about. The western end of my electorate will suffer because of the increased air traffic from Bankstown airport. It is a very serious issue for the people of Lowe. I asked you a question, Minister, on the notice paper on 28 March-and thank you for your reply of 7 June 2001. Inter alia, I asked you if there was now a satisfactory solution to the current aircraft noise problems in Sydney and, if so, upon what criteria this conclusion had been reached. The answer you provided was: The government has introduced the long-term operating plan to address Sydney airport’s noise issues. The plan has been very successful in sharing the noise generated by the airport compared with the situation that existed immediately prior to March 1996. TodayI have put a further question on notice in response to the reply that you gave me. I just want you to clearly understand, because I do not think the message is getting through to the people who are advising you, that we are getting 60 per cent more air traffic movements to the north than were foreshadowed in the long-term operating plan for the residents of Sydney. It is not truthful or fair for you to say to me that the long-term operating plan has been ‘very Wednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28201 successful in sharing the noise’, because that is not the truth. The people who are to the north and the north-west of Sydney airport are suffering the most and the planes that are flying over my electorate are avoiding the Prime Minister’s electorate. (Extension of time granted) I would like to think that you could leave this chamber this morning and go back to your officers and insist that they get a reduction in the horrendous levels of aircraft noise. As I said, we are getting 60 per cent more air traffic movements than we were promised under the long term operating plan. We, on our side of the House, think that the long-term operating plan can work but we also believe that we need a second airport for Sydney. We do not think that Bankstown is the option. I would like to know from you, and it is foreshadowed in my questions on the Notice Paper today: when will the long-term operating plan be fully implemented? In other words, I would like to know when the people of Lowe are going to get only 17 per cent air traffic movements to the north. What is your long-term plan for building Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek for the citizens of Sydney? What is the time frame for your agenda to sell Sydney airport? IfI am not mistaken, I think I heard you on radio last week in Sydney saying that you wanted to have Sydney airport sold by the end of the year. If you want to have Sydney airport sold by the end of the year, Minister, the least that you can do for my constituents, who are concerned very much by this issue, is to have air traffic movements to the north at 17 per cent and some answer with regard to how soon we can start building Badgerys Creek. Thank you. port-and it certainly must be for a minister, whether federal or state, or even for people involved in local government-is that the debate on road and rail investment in this country is appalling, and it has been appalling under all fashions of governments for far too long. Let us look at expenditure since 1996-and I am sure the Minister for Transport and Regional Services will correct me if I am wrong. We have spent about $8 billion on roads in this country but about $250 million has been committed to rail. That is an incredible imbalance. A country railroad in the electorate of, perhaps, the member for Hinkler loses a couple of million and everybody in this country goes ape. Yet we spend billions and billions of dollars subsidising roads and road transport companies in this country and we do not seem to blink one eyelid. The debate loses a considerable deal because we do not look at all the imperatives and all the impacts of funding for rail or road. For example, a recent German study showed quite clearly that if you invested a billion deutschmarks on rail, road or light rail there would be very different impacts in terms of an employment dividend. If you invest in roads, you get about 10,000 to 12,000 jobs; if you invest in heavy rail, you get about 22,000 jobs. If you invest in light rail, you get about 24,000 jobs. Maybe that is an issue that the minister ought to take on board-as should, particularly, his department, which has a particularly narrow view of anything other than road transport. I would like to make one comment about this budget: $600 million has gone towards company cars and subsidies for transport rigs. I think the minister’s own group, the Australian Rail Track Corporation, has shown that, if you spent $500 million or $600 million on rail instead of transport rigs or company cars, you could shift two or three million tonnes of freight off our roads and onto rail. It would be far more efficient, with a better employment dividend, and much better for the country. The subsidy for roads in this country amounts to billions and billions. It is a hidden subsidy, one that is forgotten in any debate-freight insurance, hospitalisation, road trauma, road maintenance, the list goes on and on and on. I am not suggesting that we should not invest in roads. That would be a stupid point of view to put forward. But the investment in and the balance between other forms of transport in this country is just simply appalling. As for the de-",173,Representatives Main Committee
348,Mr Sawford (Port Adelaide) (12.30 P.m.),"One of the great frustrations with trans28202 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 bate, I have to say that even when we were in power you never looked for any initiative or any creativity or any innovation from almost anyone in transport in this country. Professor Peter Newman, who was a transport expert in Western Australia, convinced the then Labor government to build a northern suburbs railway. It was a big investment, nearly $300 million, but it proved it worked. All the gurus who were here said that he was stupid, that the Labor government was wasting money. It was not a waste of money. That was not even a freight service, but a passenger service. Why is the debate so minimalist? Why is it so narrow? Why doesn’t it look at a wider circle than just roads, such as rail, shipping and air? Our investment in shipping in this country-and I will not go into that right now-is laughable for a trading nation, in the sense of the millions of jobs, or potential jobs, we lose because we send all our money in terms of insurance and shipping overseas. Absolute rubbish! Unfortunately, no government in this country has had the guts to take shipping seriously, but you have to say that no-one takes rail seriously either. I notice that the member for Hinkler is here. He chaired a parliamentary committee which produced what I thought was an admirable report. The report suggested a whole lot of new investment in rail. Unfortunately, that has not been taken up. In this budget there is probably only $26 million for rail. When will governments take note of the findings of bipartisan committees-committees led by people with a bit of common sense, like the member for Hinkler? But your government does not take any notice.

You are quite right that, in the great scheme of land transport, $200 million is a drop in the bucket. Nevertheless, it is not just a simplistic problem of rushing out and spending money on rail. There is a perception that, because we linked Melbourne to Adelaide back in the seventies or the eighties, we had this seamless corridor from Brisbane to Perth. It was not quite that simple. There were 23 operating standards and 14 different radio standards, so it was not a seamless corridor. In other words, for rail to achieve its full potential on that major trunk route from Brisbane to Perth-and I presume that that is what you are talking about-there are some other intermediate steps. Amongst them is the New South Wales government’s inability to grant proper access through the ARTC. This government has put the ARTC in place, and it is the access organisation. If you can get clear and transparent access from Brisbane through to Perth, you are more likely to use rail, and there is then greater justification for the government to upgrade the track. It is true that along the east-west corridor 70 per cent of the freight task goes on rail. On the north-south corridor, it is 10 per cent. Part of the reason why is the access. I am a great believer in upgrading the track. If you get the below track operations right-and I see that the member for Lowe is here; he is another supporter of this committee-you will attract state rail authority trains or private trains and you will get greater utilisation of the track.

The other thing you should recognise is that the government has also put money into Compton’s ATEC proposal for a track from Melbourne to Darwin. A lot of people said, ‘That’s pie in the sky-that’ll never happen.’ I have known Everald Compton for 30 years and he has never not made a success of something he has put his hand to-never. He has been in charge of rebuilding university colleges and things in England, and he is a master at putting major projects together. He is not saying that you should rush out and throw a lot of Commonwealth money at this thing; in fact, he wants only very modest amounts of Commonwealth money. Everald Compton says that it can be done commercially if the government gives certain support, and the government has done so-it has funded a prefeasibility study from Melbourne to Brisbane and it has funded a freight study from Toowoomba to Gladstone, which proved positive. It said that if you got these new coal mines in the Serap Basin going then that was justified. The government has encouraged this organisation to prove each step of this thing. You do not build a train right through to Darwin and expect it to pay. You take it through the most productive part of Australia-central Victoria, central western New South Wales, southern Queensland to Toowoomba, with a branch down to Brisbane; that is feasible. The study says it is feasible onto Gladstone. Then a fortnight or three weeks ago, the minister gave another $250,000 to do the prefeasibility study for the section from Toowoomba to Gladstone. I do not think that shows the government stepping away from it. I, like you, would like more spent on the below-track infrastructure. I firmly believe that that is where we can have a huge increase in usage. An example of this is the line from Brisbane to Rockhampton, which successive Queensland governments have done up to tilt rail standard, which has halved the travel time from Rockhampton to Brisbane. We could be doing this all over Australia. I agree with you in principle but I do not think it is necessarily fair to be bagging the government, because this minister has been quite supportive. of the member for Hinkler, but we have never spent big on rail in this country. There is a fallacious argument that gets put forward. I remember a fellow who used to advise our side of parliament in 1983, from New South Wales railways, a fellow called David Hill. I remember his contribution when the Adelaide-Darwin railway should have been built by us in that early period of the Hawke-Keating government, and was not-for all the wrong reasons. The wrong reasons were-and that was part of the fallacious argument put forward then-‘You don’t solve the problem by throwing money at it.’ That is a pretty glib statement, because we have not thrown money at rail in this country for 50 or 60 years. So let us not talk that sort of nonsense, for goodness sake. I said I would be brief and I know there are other people who want to speak in this debate. I would like to say something of a positive nature. I understand, in the way government operates in this nation, that if you are the minister for transport, state or federal, you have a very difficult go because it is not part of an intellectual debate. The debate is far too narrow. Noone looks at the employment dividends. No-one looks at the dividends in terms of the trauma and the injuries that you see in Australia-the people who live all the rest of their lives crippled and maimed, unnecessarily, because of road accidents. I have just come back from New Zealand. It is just amazing the people you see on the street, young and old, who are crippled. When you talk to them they say how they were crippled: road accidents. They have one of the greatest rates of road accident trauma in the world, partly because of their road system and",176,Representatives Main Committee

It is only a country of 3.4 million people but they did have commuter train systems. There are other impacts than just the road or rail debate. There is an employment dividend. There is a care of citizen duty that often never comes up in the road or rail or shipping debate. There are defence aspects, as well. I must say, even though I would have liked to have seen a far greater contribution-and I am sure the member for the Northern Territory supports this as well-that creating a north-south land bridge on the only island continent on earth, the Adelaide-Alice Springs-Darwin railway, is a great thing. I do not think, in the debate, anyone has explored the possibilities of what can be done not only for the eastern seaboard, on the eastern side of the Dividing Range-which so much debate in this country seems to boil down tobut for Australia. The member for Hinkler mentioned that 70 per cent of the freight from Adelaide to Perth goes on the rail. It ought to be 100 per cent. There is no reason for any semitrailer, B-double or whatever, to go from Adelaide to Perth. There is a company in my electorate called AirRide. I am sure you are familiar with it; I am sure you have been there. You can load up 100 semitrailers on a train in two or three hours. Yet no-one has invested in that company. I say to the member for Hinkler that in the United States they have tens of thousands of these things on their freight systems. They are highly efficient and it gets the trucks off the road. We have trucks going from Adelaide to Brisbane on a daily basis. That is just stupid. Under what conditions do those semitrailer drivers operate? Some of them are taking loads up there and hanging around so long, trying to get a job to get back, that over a period of time they are actually losing money because their margins have been pushed so hard by some of these so-called logistics companies. We need a new approach to transport. I am one of the few people on this side who actually has had a bit of time for you, right from the first time you came in here, Deputy Prime Minister. I actually think you have, in many ways, a sensible approach to problems. But I would like to see you, in this term of government-which might not be much longer-look at it in terms of much broader perspectives than you do now. (Time expired) intended to speak upon, but I will make some comments in passing. I am pleased to see that the government has lived up to its commitment to fund its portion of the Darwin to Alice Springs railway, which has bipartisan support. Kim Beazley committed the Labor Party to that funding prior to the last election. It is worth noting, however, that it would have been a lot cheaper if it had been built in 1984, when it was offered to the Northern Territory government on a 60-40 split but the then Northern Territory Chief Minister, Paul Everingham-who later became the member for the Northern Territory-refused the offer. That rests fairly and squarely in the lap of the Northern Territory government and the CLP, this government’s partners in the Northern Territory. Having said that, I think the Darwin to Alice Springs railway can-and may-bring great benefits. I am certainly hopeful that it will. But there are some downsides which we ought to contemplate. I do not quite share the views of my colleague from Port Adelaide on the issue of road transport, because I think the road transport industry is a very efficient industry. Whilst the margins are being cut for a whole range of reasons, not the least of which is the GST, the fact is that it provides timely delivery of goods which cannot be provided by rail. It is not my intention to go into that debate. I want to make the observation, however, that the development of the Darwin to Alice Springs railway has started and, while even as we speak facilities are being developed in Tennant Creek and Katherine, there is some concern in Alice Springs that people in the communities there who are well equipped to do the work may not",177,Representatives Main Committee

To me that means that, whilst it adds substance to the Northern Territory economy in terms of money coming in, people in the Territory may be missing out. I think the focus of employment in this rail project should be on employing people locally, on training up people in the Northern Territory to do this work and on subcontracting to Northern Territory firms. I come now to the main concern I want to express today. I do not share the view of my colleague about the Deputy Prime Minister. Unfortunately, I see him as being a very partisan person who has used the Roads to Recovery program to rort the Treasury of this country for his own political purposes. I would like him to explain to me how he could possibly get to the position where his own electorate could receive, I think, $43 million when the Northern Territory received only $20 million in road funding under the Roads to Recovery programwhy. proach of the Labor Party you would have understood that, using state shares of local government grants, the Northern Territory traditionally receives $28.1 million. Under your formula it received $20 million. You are $8.1 million shy. What is the answer to that? Where did that go? Whose backyard did that fill in? Can you explain how you got $43 million? Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs Gash)-Would you direct your questions through the chair, thank you. ister: be left in no doubt about how you are perceived in the Northern Territory, because you have used your position. I note that all of the 17 electorates receiving funding of more than $25 million are held by coalition government membersarea of 114,000 square kilometres. The seat of the Northern Territory is an area of 1.34 million square kilometres. The number of voters in Gwydir is 72,930. The number of voters in the Northern Territory is 105,048. The population at the 1996 census for Gwydir was 111,146. The population of the Northern Territory was 190,000. The amount of money given to the seat of Gwydir equates per voter to $581 per head. In the case of the Northern Territory it is $190 per head. Per square kilometre it is $372 in Gwydir and $15 in the Northern Territory. (Extension of time granted) Even if you use the formula which is used to allocate local government road funding, where I believe the Northern Territory is underfunded, we are still at least 25 per cent shy of what we should be entitled to. There can be no valid explanation as to why people in the Northern Territory should be robbed blind by the Deputy Prime Minister through the Roads to Recovery program while he allocates resources to his mates. Let us be clear about it. Another issue which needs to be comprehended here is that the Northern Territory has special needs. I note, Madam Deputy Speaker, that the Deputy Prime Minister will use the justification that money has been made available to local government areas. Of course he knows, as do his advisers, that large areas of the Northern Territory roads are on unincorporated lands. As I understand it, no substantial allocation has been made. Of the Northern Territory government total, less than $2 million has been allocated for unincorporated roads. The literally thousands and thousands of kilometres of roads in the Northern Territory on unincorporated land are not funded. What is the result of that? Let me tell you.

I rang them the other week to try to find out what the price of fuel was. They could not tell me. They said, ‘We can’t tell you what the price of fuel here is because we do not have any. Why don’t we have any? Because we can’t get it delivered.’ That would not be tolerated in the member for Gwydir’s electorate. It would not be tolerated in the electorates of the members for Maranoa, Kalgoorlie, Wannon, Parkes, McEwen, Kennedy, Indi, Farrer, Mallee, New England, Flinders, Gippsland, Murray, Riverina or Ballarat. All these electorates will receive $25 million or more under the Roads to Recovery program. The most disadvantaged people in Australia, the poorest people in Australia, bar none, live in the Northern Territory. The most disadvantaged in terms of transport infrastructure live in the Northern Territory. What this government has done is to treat them with contempt. We will get some response from the Deputy Prime Minister no doubt trying to justify his position. Let me ask you, Mr Deputy Prime Minister: if you are not responsible for these roads, who is? If you are not prepared to provide the funding for these roads, who should? If you do not accept responsibility for every Australian citizen in terms of this government and road infrastructure, who should? I understand the Northern Territory government have got a responsithe money from? Should they get it from their own resources, or should you be reviewing the Grants Commission formula to ensure they get more money? There has got to be an answer to this, and thus far it has not been forthcoming. It is not only in this area, of course, that this is a question. I am conscious of the fact that other people want to speak, but I do want to raise another issue that really compounds this question of roads infrastructure, and that is the question of the impact of the GST on fuel. Let me ask the Deputy Prime Minister: do you think it is appropriate that people who live in my electorate, or at least some of them-in this case the people who live in Milikapiti on Bathurst Island-should pay an extra 10.3c tax on a litre of fuel as a result of the GST, whereas people in the Prime Minister’s own electorate pay 2.58c extra tax as a result of the GST? That comes about because of the price of fuel. When the price of fuel is $1.80 a litre and you are paying huge amounts of extra tax, there has got to be an answer. I recall vividly the former Deputy Prime Minister visiting my electorate prior to the last election, with his Akubra-hail fellow, well met-saying to everyone who wanted to listen to him that the price of fuel need not rise. We had the then Northern Territory Chief Minister, now President of the Liberal Party, saying that the price of fuel would fall by 7c a litre. (Time expired) to do with rail. We spoke about going from Melbourne to Adelaide. When we were on that committee and examined that track, it was a disgrace. We saw strips 20 and 30 metres long where the rails sat in a permanent puddle of mud. The Hon. Ralph Willis was with us at the time and he was Treasurer. Even he was outraged, because he could remember the amounts of money that he had allocated to that. We went to a marshalling yard where there were literally thousands of concrete sleepers that had never been used. They actually put the new concrete the new sleepers. What a shambles.

365,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (12.55 P.m.),"I would like to clear up two things. The first one isWednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28207 take the point made by the member for Port Adelaide, it is not simply a matter of throwing money. I was not being glib when I said that you could not throw money at it. There has got to be a strategic plan. To get a strategic plan you have got to have the states cede a certain amount of their power, whether or not it be in access through the ARTC, so that people are going to use the track. That is the first thing. The second thing is that I believe the answer is-and it is a recommendation in the report-that the main trunk line from Brisbane to Perth, via both Broken Hill and Melbourne, should be treated like the national road highway. It should be ceded to and controlled by the Commonwealth, either through the ARTC or through another corporation. Then you would get some of the benefits that you have spoken about. I think that should be a long-term ambition and a bipartisan position of all parties in this parliament. On the matter of the Roads to Recovery grant, the argument from the member for the Northern Territory is exactly the same argument that I get from some of my larger but small area cities against the shires. They say, ‘Why does the city of so-and-so get so little money, when the shire of so-and-so, with only a tenth of the population, gets so much more?’ It is because the formula is based not just on population but on the distance of roads. It is not based on area. It works out at about 80 per cent of the council’s federal assistance grants. Those federal assistance grants, which are Commonwealth money, are allocated by the states through their grants commissions. It is hardly fair to start blaming the Commonwealth. You control all the states in Australia now bar South Australia. How can the member for Northern Territory start blaming the Commonwealth government because of the formula? It should not be a surprise to him that electorates like Gwydir, Maranoa, Kennedy and Leichhardtties-I imagine 11 or 12 in each electorate-that have long distances of road. In fact, you rather selectively left out the electorate of Capricornia. I think you will find that your colleague the member for Capricornia was also treated very generously-not because it is a Labor electorate or a National Party electorate or a Liberal electorate, but because it has a population base for each of those shires and a length of roads that have to be attended to. Quite frankly, while I understand the member’s concern for his area-and I do not quibble with that at all-this confected outrage because the formulasurely that is a matter for the Northern Territory government to take to the Grants Commission, or for you, as the local memberMr Snowdon interjectingSpeaker, the formula is fair.

It has made a huge difference to the shires, cities and towns of my electorate, and I am pleased to have it. be a community in Australia that would not welcome the money. Give people the resources and they will accept them-there is no question about that. However, this is not about whether or not they should accept the money.

That is wrong. Get the Deputy Prime Minister to come to some of these committees and explain why people cannot travel on their roads and why the roads are inaccessible for some months of the yearand not just because of the weather. There are some roads in communities in my electorate which heavy vehicles will not travel on because of the state of disrepair. That imposes a huge cost on those communities-the poorest communities in Australia. And yet the Deputy Prime Minister does not bat an eyelid. I was talking about fuel prices, and I was retelling a story about the former Deputy Prime Minister parading around Northern Australia saying how the price of fuel need not rise. Let me ask this question of the Deputy Prime Minister: as a result of the GST, people at Milikapiti payMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs Gash)-Order! You will direct your questions through the chair. fuel. The extra tax they pay within that $1.80 as a result of the GST is 10.37c. The good burghers of North Ryde, when the price of fuel was 94.9c a litre-which was only a couple of weeks ago; I am not sure what it is today-paid 2.61c a litre in extra tax. How do you explain to the people in my electorate-people who live in remote communities and pay anywhere between, in Darwin, $1.03 to, in some places, $2 a litre-that the GST is a major component of the final price of the good, and it is different for them than it is for people living in Sydney and Melbourne? Why should people in the Northern Territory who live in remote communities pay more tax on their fuel as a result of the GST than the Deputy Prime Minister does in his own electorate? Why should they? What possible justification is there for people in the Northern Territory paying more total tax on their fuel when you include the GST than any other Australians? These are the poorest Australians, and they get the double whammy: not only do they pay more for their fuel with the extra impost of the GST but they do not get the resources to fix the roads on which they drive their vehicles. A cartoon was published in the Northern Territory News of 28 May-‘Wicking’s View’. I commend it to honourable members. The cartoon shows a male and a female sitting in a room. ‘Snowdon is calling on the government to spend more on roads,’ says the woman to her husband. Outside the window is a motor vehicle. The male says, ‘That we can’t afford to drive on.’ It is pretty true. If you live in the Northern Territory, you suffer because of what this government has done, and we have had no reasonable explanation as to why the people of the Northern Territory should be discriminated against and disadvantaged in the way in which they have been by this government.

The member for Prospect raised the matter of the Western Sydney orbital. In an ideal world, roads would be free, I suppose-as should petrol-but they never will be. The approach that we took there, worked up in consultation with all of the stakeholders, enabled us to bring forward by many years the construction of this major piece of very badly needed infrastructure in Western Sydney. There will be real savings in time and energy, and there will be business and personal benefits from the construction of the road. Motorists will have the option of using other roads if they choose not to pay a toll, of course. On balance, it is a reasonable way forward. I was keen to see it brought forward; I believe Minister Scully in New South Wales was as well. There was quite a bit of talk about the airports and airport related matters in Sydney, not just by the member for Prospect but by other members as well. The government sought to take a balanced decision in the interests of the various sectors of the community which have a very real concern about Sydney’s future airport needs. It became very apparent to me, as I looked at what had happened internationally and listened to the players here, that for commercial reasons-the aviation industry seeking to meet the needs of its customers-people would not use another airport for a very long time into the future. The airline companies would adopt what are euphemistically known in the industry as coping strategies, which is to say that they would rearrange their schedules so that some flights overflew Sydney, in other cases there would be a rationalisation of the number of small planes, running effectively shuttle services between Sydney and other capitals-all sorts of measures would be used to avoid having to use other airports for as long as possible into the future, at least for the next decade. There is little point engaging in spending a whole lot of money somewhere else on what would be a white elephant, and we will review the matter in 2005. I make this commitment to the people of Sydney who are affected by noise-and I understand that it is a real issue. The member for Lowe raised this matter; I understand that he is perfectly sincere in that regard. The curfew will remain, the cap on movements per hour will remain, the regionals will remain-which, of course, is important for the residents. You understand that if many of the regionals pulled out, they would immediately be replaced by a noisy jet. That is not lacking in substance in terms of the issues that the member’s constituents face, and I appreciate his concerns for them. curfew will remain and the cap will remain-80 movements an hour-is that we will continue to strive to make LTOP work. We believe that we are effectively sharing the noise in a fairer way than in the past and that people are getting substantial periods of respite. I know full well that people will always have concerns about aircraft noise. I get complaints about aircraft noise from the most extraordinary airports in the country. Some of them only have a very limited number of planes flying in and out of them. But if it happens at the wrong time, people become concerned about it.

The Roads to Recovery program has been mentioned by many members. It is a $1.2 billion program, and there was an additional $400 million for expansion of RONIs-although not exclusively RONIs-in the outer metropolitan areas. This recognised the built-up need for some extra funding for infrastructure on such projects as the F3, a project that the member for Robertson raised. There is $80 million for that and there is a contribution to the Scoresby Freeway coming out of that money, which will make a real difference. The Roads to Recovery program has been very widely welcomed. Most of our local roads were put down during the fifties and the sixties. They have now reached the end of their design lives-and are well past them in many cases. There are horror stories told by councils all around the country about how far behind the roads are. Of course, the distribution was based on the state’s grants commission. (Extension of time granted) We actually did that quite deliberately, because we knew that there would be those who would say that we did not seek to be fair and reasonable. So we thought that we would find a formula that is pretty closely tied to one that has been used not only by us but also by previous governments.

The member for Northern Territory, in his own extraordinary style-in which there is room for no grace, no understanding, no legitimate debate, no legitimate exchange of views-accuses me of an untruth in relation to a matter that I have not covered. That is the point. that I suspect the community regards as unacceptable behaviour on the part of politicians is when they will never extend a willingness to acknowledge a valuable program and when one is twisted into something that it is not or into something that is distorted and corrupt, which is effectively what the member opposite accuses me of. It is really quite obvious that the formula is very closely related to that of the states grants commissions and it takes into account, across the nation, a combination of road distance and population. It is a valuable program and there have been many members of the Labor Party who have acknowledged that, including some in this chamber today, and I thank them for it. In relation to the Great Western Highway, which the member for Calare raised, I make the general comment that we have, as you know, made a contribution to the Great Western Highway of $100 million. It is a state road, it is not part of the national highway. We have expanded funding well beyond the Great Western Highway. (Extension of time granted) We have expanded road funding into a number of categories that were not previously fundedthat is one-but the RONIs program, the resurrection of a Black Spots program and Roads to Recovery are all road programs that were, if you like, specifically excluded after the early 1990s agreement, under the previous government, whereby the funding of the national highway grid only would be undertaken by the Commonwealth government. As funds have become available we have sought to work cooperatively with other levels of government on roads of strategic and other importance-that being one of them. I am aware of the calls to look at a second major highway over the mountains. I would have to say that there are very mixed views on whether it is wise to proceed with that but I acknowledge that you raise quite a concern. Traffic jams and the congestion on that transport link are very substantial. Let me come to the member for Port Adelaide and to the more general issue that the member for Calare raised about transport planning and about rail. Let me return the compliment. I too have a regard for the member for Port Adelaide, a decent and fair parliamentarian who is always prepared to be gracious about people on the other side of the House and not to personalise his views, which makes it much easier to have a constructive and meaningful debate. I would like to make some general comments. I understand your enthusiasm for rail and I believe too that we ought to be doing more to advance interstate rail competitiveness, if I can put it that way, across this nation.

398,Mr Sawford,"It should be 100 per cent.28212 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 is actually the highest level of freight support of any similar rail length in the world today. It is actually the highest; it is much higher than it was. The cost has come down and the transport times have come down with a surprisingly modest investment in track. It is a good model and we ought to pursue it. As the member for Hinkler said, the next major step-it is really quite logical if you stop to think about it-is the north-south freight corridor between Melbourne and Brisbane and the points between and beyond. It has about 10 per cent of the freight task at the moment. An audit report by the ARTC was commissioned after the very valuable reports that had come from the private sector and from this place. They were valuable reports and I thank those responsible for them. We commissioned the audit report by the Australian Rail Track Corporation to have a close look at how we ought to rearrange these things. They again identified the need for more money but said that, until you get the management structures right and the management issues sorted out, you are not going to get the traffic volumes that you want. The key issue is unquestionably getting the New South Wales Carr government to get serious about track access, signalling and consistency of arrangements. I do not say that as a partisan remark because there are other governments of both persuasions that have helped us to secure seamless interstate track operations, but we need them on the north-south corridor. I urge those opposite, in the spirit of bipartisanship, to help us do everything we can to get the New South Wales government, which for various reasons is pretty focused on what is happening with its passenger transport network around Sydney, sorted out. We have had money on the table now for a couple of years, for a dedicated freight line through Sydney, and nothing has happened. In the last budget I pulled that back, and we put it into Australian Rail Track Corporation instead, and said that they are to fund it only on the basis of improvements in management and access arrangements. I think there are all sorts of very sound reasons why we need to be rejuvenating rail. Energy conservation is one and greenhouse is another, but there are all sorts of other efficiencies: congestion in the capital city ports and what have you. All of those are very sound reasons for supporting the redevelopment and expansion of rail in this country. I think that broadly covers the major issues that were raised. I notice fuel excise mentioned again-I always think that, if you want to enter the debate and make some critical comments, you have a lot more credibility if you acknowledge the good work that was done first, and in relation to fuel excise several things need to be acknowledged. One is that we have dramatically reduced the fuel excise on transport, including rail. It has all gone. We have actually taken the excise off rail, and that is a very worthwhile reform. (Extension of time granted) I think I heard the member for the Northern Territory say that he thought the trucking industry was an efficient and important industry, and he praised them up. They of course very much welcome what we have done in abolishing sales tax and indirect taxation burdens on their industry. It has made a very big difference, particularly in areas like the Northern Territory which are freight export oriented, and in which freight costs can impose real difficulties on local communities. In addition, it needs to be remembered that we have dedicated something like $900 million to rural and remote areas to offset the impact of the GST on petrol prices. All of us regret higher petrol pricesfor the Northern Territory-and he wonders why he is not given much credibility. We ought to remember that for every four barrels of oil we are using at the moment we are only discovering one new one, and that is something that Australia only has limited control over, but that",185,Representatives Main Committee

In addition, I would point out that fuel excise rose by 500 per cent when the Labor Party was in power-I repeat, 500 per cent. By comparison it has slowed to a trickle under us, and we have now scrapped Labor’s automatic indexation of fuel excise. So there is another side to the story that ought to be told. In conclusion, can I thank members opposite and members on this side for their contribution to the debate. If there are any further detailed questions that people would like to place on notice, I will happily seek to agree to handle those. I notice the member for Lowe has indicated he has some more detailed questions coming to me on notice.

Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-No, you weren’t. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Thank you. if he would not mind responding to me-if that is the way I am supposed to ask this question-as to why the people in the Northern Territory, the people at Milikapiti, should expect to pay 397 per cent extra GST as a proportion of the price paid by the people at North Ryde. Why should the people of the Northern Territory be required-and I ask the Deputy Prime Minister through you, Madam Deputy Speaker, if he would bother responding to the people of the Northern Territory-to pay more GST on their fuel than any other Australians? Perhaps also the minister could explain to the people of the Northern Territory why they should believe anything that he or his party says, because you will recall that I started off my earlier contribution by making the observation that the then Deputy Prime Minister had said the price of fuel need not rise as a result of the GST.

I make the point again that his constituents ought to take note of the very real reductions in fuel excise in a number of areas that are of critical importance to people living in far-flung places like the Northern Territory, particularly in relation to transport fuels, and again I emphasise that a constructive debate always requires a degree of goodwill and recognition-by parties on all sides-of gains as well as losses. Minister: at Milikapiti, under the old regime, excise was 44.137c a litre, which you will recall. Under the new regime it is 38.14c a litre currently, and extra GST is 10.37c. Whichever way the Deputy Prime Minister tries to portray it-I accept that fuel excise has come down, I accept that you have abolished indexation, I accept all of that; that is not my query-my query is why should people in the Northern Territory and people who live in high cost areas pay more as a result of the GST for goods and services than other Australians? In this case it happens to be fuel. Can you answer that question? Why should people in my electorate, who are, as I repeat, amongst the poorest of Australians with some of the highest costs of living, when they drive to and from work or into town, in a case such as that of Milikapiti be required to pay so much more for their fuel as a result of the GST than other people in Australia? That is a simple question; it should receive a simple answer. The thing has to be viewed in totality; that is the first point I would make. You mentioned they were paying something like 40c in excise per litre. I think you will find that about 32c of that was imposed by the Labor Party. I will check the figures and I will come back you, but you have to view taxation imposts and the burden in any specific area in the totality of the taxation and other financial frameworks that pertain to that community. Tax reform was very much needed in the interests of rural and regional Australia. I make no apologies for saying that. I believe that rural and regional Australia is better off for it. There is the reality that some types of taxes will accumulate a little more in some areas than in others, but I have noticed, on average, a closing of the country-city price differential in recent times. You can always find examples where it has gone the other way. If they are excessive, we can have them looked at, but I will respond in full when I have checked out the figures in the claims.

That might be disappointing for a lot of individuals who have a passion for and a commitment to the arts, either as participants or as consumers who enjoy the product produced by artists in the various areas of our society.

412,Mr Mcmullan (Fraser) (4.06 P.m.),"I want to speak particularly about the arts aspectWednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28215 My concern is that the knowledge nation of the 21st century requires not only those aspects that are commonly referred to, such as science, engineering and research and development; in the 21st century content is king. The countries which are producing the content that will drive the information technology and other products of the 21st century will be the countries which succeed. And that requires encouragement of the creative people in our community, protection of their intellectual property, incentive for them to produce, and a climate in which they feel respected, acknowledged, appreciated and encouraged. All of that is lacking in this budget. I have made those comments before but I repeat them because it is a source of great disappointment to me. I want today to deal with some specific matters. I hope that the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, when he arrives, will be able to respond to some of these specific matters. I want first to deal with the issue of contemporary music. I am extremely concerned that there is nothing in this budget for contemporary music except cuts. In 1998, the government was under pressure on the issue of contemporary music in the lead-up to the election because of its disastrous decision about parallel importation of CDs and its consequences for young artists and Australian recording companies. It was under pressure, the arts community was campaigning, and it responded by throwing in $10 million. It is very typical of this government, in the lead-up to an election, under pressure, to decide to provide taxpayers’ funds to bail out problems it has created. So it provided a $10 million fund for contemporary music export, to assist business planning and market development, the development of an online strategy, specific programs for particular states, a contemporary music touring program and community broadcasting. That $10 million program runs out on 30 June this year. To continue, it needed funding in this budget, and there was not one cent. It was an unannounced, unheralded $10 million cut in support for contemporary music, which is the art form of the young generation of creative Australians that young Australians listen to and enjoy. The most important loss to the contemporary music industry will be the touring program that used to be operated through Playing Australia. The disappointment that this program was not continued was best summed up by the Music Managers Forum, which labelled the abandonment of the contemporary music touring program with disappointment and regret and said: The government must acknowledge that despite a huge financial windfall from the music industry, its reciprocal reinvestment in the sector and its commitment to the development of a valid powerful youth culture is minimal. This industry faces the continuing impact of parallel importation, but the compensation package is gone. It is once again typical of this government. It is like the GST. The GST continues forever, but the compensation is only temporary. (Extension of time granted) The contemporary music industry will continue to be hit by this flawed policy with regard to parallel imports, but the compensation package has been eliminated. The cynics amongst us might suggest that the government’s plan is to allow this to lapse so that, come the election, they can announce it again and it will be a new policy. It is called filling in the hole you dug for yourself and calling it progress. So they have dug a $10 million hole for the contemporary music industry. I would be pleased if they went to the election offering to fill it in again, but I am very doubtful. WhatI am really concerned about is the future of the contemporary music touring program. Will the government commit to it again? AmI right in assuming that it has been abolished? If it has been abolished, what assistance is there for the contemporary music industry? I await advice from the minister. That example is being painfully followed by the book industry now. The book industry knows exactly the two problems the contemporary music industry faces: one, the threat of 28216 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 parallel imports; and, two, the risk that the damage to their industry will continue while the compensation package gets eroded. We are having a debate on a bill in this parliament at the moment about the extension of the parallel importation principles of the book industry. There have been some, not surprisingly, eloquent critiques of that by some of our great Australian writers, such as Frank Moorehouse, who appeared before the Senate committee and in a very devastating manner illustrated the flaws in the government’s approach and the threat to young Australian writers and Australian publishers if this flawed policy is continued. The book industry knows the nature of this government’s attitude. It already feels threatened because of what it has seen happen to contemporary music. The industry is not being offered any compensation for the impact of parallel importation, but it is aware that it has already been severely hit by the GST. It was offered a compensation package in return for that, but just like the parallel importation effect, the GST is in forever but it is not sure how long the compensation package will last. There is no compensation for the book industry for the threat that it faces from parallel imports. SoI am really concerned that this government continues to attack the arts. It attacks the fundamental basis of intellectual property protection and the capacity of creative Australians to earn income from their intellectual property. It does not just affect artists; it is also true in the software industry-but that is not my brief for today; I have spoken about that elsewhere. All of those people feel that their capacity to earn income from their creativity is under threat by this government. What is the 21st century about? It is about countries gaining income from their ideas, from their brainpower. So this government puts in place policies to make it impossible. The third thing I want to talk about is the cynical exercise by the government with regard to the Young and Emerging Artists Initiative and the Major Festivals Initiative-two proposals introduced by the government in 1998 with great fanfare. In the budget, they announced renewed support for them. But, if you read the fine print for those two programs, this renewed support means they have got 12 months to live: they are on death row. They will be abolished straight after the election. They have not been abolished now because young Australians resent enough the attack on the contemporary music industry. They do not want to see their new and emerging artists program attacked as well. But they are under threat. The only salvation might be that same cynical view that the government are merely withdrawing funding in this budget so that nobody can plan-the major festivals are in crisis-so they can emerge and make an announcement at the election to say, ‘Aren’t we clever? We are proposing to fill in the hole we just dug. We will renew these two programs if we are re-elected.’ But major project planning takes longer than that and this is a disastrous approach. (Extension of time granted) I assure others here that this will be my last extension because I know others wish to have a chance to speak. There are many other matters that I wish to raise but, having spoken about my concern about the general problem in the budget and with this government, of lack of commitment to the arts and creativity and my concern about contemporary music, the book industry, the Young and Emerging Artists Initiative and the Major Festivals Initiative, I want to turn briefly to the ABC. Like many other Australians, I am extremely concerned about the lack of Australian drama on ABC Television. The amount of BBC reruns such as Yes, Minister, Fawlty Towers, One Foot in the Grave is now beyond a joke. As much as I may have enjoyed some of those programs when they were first run-and I quite enjoyed them the second, and I did not mind them even in the third-I really got a bit disappointed recently to see at the end of a Yes, Minister program, when they have the credits at the end that the copyright was dated 1975. A terWednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28217 ries told by their fellow Australians, creating jobs and opportunity for creative Australians to produce programs and participate in programs, write music, act, write scripts, produce, direct and provide their technical expertise, it produces nothing. Australians should be able to turn on the ABC and hear their own stories. Of course, there are alarming allegations-and I would like the minister to assure the Main Committee that this is not true-that the ABC was bidding for the rights for The Weakest Link and that one of the reasons why Gail Jarvis was dismissed was that she was unsuccessful in winning the rights to The weakest link. We want to know if that is true. But I am more concerned about the decline in drama production on ABC television and, what is less noticed, the impact on ABC radio. The ABC radio drama on ABC-FM, Soundstage, which went for years and which was very successful, has now been undermined. Soundstage was on ABC-FM for 25 years and has now gone. We have had cuts to artists’ fees on ABC radio. I want to know where are the resources for drama production on TV and radio? In drama production I include documentary productionAustralian new material with Australian stories told by Australians to Australians. That is why we provide money to the ABC. It is why it is such a great icon in this country, because it is how we see and hear our own stories, things that do not appear anywhere else. It is being cut, hacked and pulled back. Since 1996 we have had substantial cuts to ABC funding, and this is a hole the government has not even filled in. The government is claiming great virtue in providing $17 million, which goes a very small part of the way to filling in the hole-and as best as we can tell none of that money is available for ABC drama production on TV and radio. Ostensibly it is available for any purpose but it appears that there are agreements between the government and the ABC that this money will be supplied for what seem to me to be very worthwhile purposes, of which I am not critical, but there seems to be nothing for drama production for TV and radio. The last point I have time to make is that the minister has claimed in his media release that the ABC in Perth has been financed to purchase and construct a new office. That is quite a good thing, but what he neglects to mention is that, in the move, the ABC has sold the purpose-built home for the West Australian Symphony Orchestra and provided no new home. So we have the West Australian Symphony Orchestra-one of the great orchestras of this country and very important for the most isolated capital city in the world-with the threat of no home, a state government trying to come up with ways to rescue that terrible situation, and silence from the federal government. We have a budget that is disastrous for the arts and artists and for Australians who love the arts, and that flies in the face of what a knowledge nation in the 21st century should require. the member for Fraser in his invaluable contribution to this debate, particularly regarding parallel imports in relation to the book industry, and his support for the ABC. The ABC is an important national institution and I am here this afternoon once again to support the ABC. Anyone who has any doubts about my credentials on this topic need look no further than the Hansard records of 21 June 1999, 9 August 1999, 22 November 1999, 31 October 2000 and 6 December 2000, when I participated in the MPI debate in respect of the funding cuts to the ABC and also questions on notice. I will get to that in a minute. My concern is that under this government over the last six years we have seen $66 million of cuts to the ABC budget. In some piecemeal approach the government has restored",188,Representatives Main Committee
413,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (4.21 P.m.),"I would like to begin by supporting the comments by28218 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 $17.78 million per year. If you want any indication of the significance of that against the background of the significant funding cuts over the life of the last two parliaments under the Howard government, you have only to refer to this question which we all heard the Leader of the Opposition ask the Prime Minister today: Prime Minister, how can you justify spending $20 million a month on government advertising when you were only prepared to give the ABC an extra $17 million a year? Why is spending $20 million a month to save your political skin a higher priority than adequately funding the national broadcaster? This is further evidence of the dishonesty of the Howard government in terms of its attack on the ABC, that the best that it can offer is a restoration of $17 million a year when it is quite happy to spend $20 million of your money, Australian taxpayers’ money, to be re-elected. It is a very cynical exercise. What could be more important than maintenance of the national public broadcaster? Unfortunately, in Australia most of the public opinion is manipulated by the Murdoch group or the Packer group. I have expressed concern on many occasions about our media laws. If we continue to erode the funding to the ABC, as has occurred under this government, we are going to be left, particularly in this digital age, with more of Mr Packer and more of Mr Murdoch. Clearly, that is not in the public interest. The greatest threat to our democracy is concentration of the media. If we do not get a further opinion-that is, an opinion from the public broadcaster-God help this country. The criticism which is being levelled at the ABC at the moment-that it is biased and is presenting the views of, or running an agenda to support, the opposition-is not a fair criticism. You only have to look at the history of the ABC: the criticism was levelled at the ABC when we were in government, both in New South Wales under Premier Wran and more recently in federal government under Prime Minister Hawke and Prime Minister Keating. There was considerable criticism of the ABC from our side of politics. As I have said before in this chamber, if the ABC runs an editorial of the day which is against the interests of government, state or federal, people are going to cry that there is bias. We have to truly make the ABC independent and properly resourced. We have to fund the ABC. I have a clear recollection of Minister Alston prior to the last federal election promising that he would preserve the funding and independence of the ABC. What have we seen of the behaviour of Minister Alston? More recently we had that fiasco in the Senate estimates hearing where he did not like the very rigorous scrutiny that was being visited by the committee on Managing Director Shier in terms of his accountability to the taxpayers of Australia for his management of the ABC. He attempted to shut down that committee. Senator Alston could not cop the heat and attempted to hijack that committee or even usurp the role of the chairman of that committee. That clearly shows the duplicity of Senator Alston because he promised to maintain funding and independence, and he attempted to shut down the committee. (Extension of time granted) In addition to the grave concerns that we all have with the management of the ABC at the moment, we also have concerns with the board of the ABC, as I have said on a number of occasions in this House. The board, for a very long period of time, has been stacked by supporters on both sides of the parliament, and clearly that affects the independence of the ABC. The time has definitely arrived to get a truly independent ABC.

Obviously, the chairman of the ABC is doing the work of the Prime Minister in trying to sabotage ture-have him rusticate-because he is obviously only going to do irreparable damage if he stays in this job. He has a managing director who appears to be out of control, given all the dissatisfaction of the staff of the ABC and the low morale. I had just been reading Mr Shier’s address to the Sydney Institute yesterday. This is a good read and, if one could live up to it, one would have some hope that the ABC would have a future. But, unfortunately, Mr Shier’s track record is not terribly good. He is pretty good at mouthing the rhetoric but not at delivering. Hence, the mass resignations and the unrest in the ABC. One thing I have a real concern about in terms of the funding relates to a question that I put on notice to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts on 2 November 2000. I asked the minister: Will the Minister allow the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to become a fully-fledged business in e-commerce, deriving advertising revenue from its web sites or associated web sites? What do you think his response was? He said: The ABC is an independent statutory corporation established under the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. The Government has no role in programming or operational matters. Section 25 of the Act empowers the ABC to enter into contracts, acquire and dispose of property and do other things incidental to its powers. It is the responsibility of the ABC Board to ensure that any activities undertaken by the ABC, including any online activities, are consistent with the Act and do not in any way affect the ABC’s editorial independence. What we have here in writing, enshrined in Hansard on 28 November 2000, is the minister’s acquiescence with regard to the ABC being able to raise revenue to obviously plug the hole from the very savage budget cuts that the Howard government has visited on the ABC. This is a very serious issue because I believe that the ABC should have a finite budget which is given to them at the start of the financial year so they know exactly what money they have to manage their full operations. They should not be reliant on raising revenue. The other thing that Mr Shier seems to be keen on is to raise the ratings of the ABC and to popularise the ABC. The member for Fraser mentioned here a moment ago that Gail Jarvis resigned because of Mr Shier’s desire to put The Weakest Link on the ABC. It is outrageous that you would put such a program on the ABC. Do we ever want to see an ABC where there are programs such as The Weakest Link or The Footy Show? The ABC was never meant to have those sorts of programs. The ABC is supposed to provide news and information, education and science programs, entertainment and the arts. (Extension of time granted) I promise to wind up and give others a go because I am sure I am preaching to the converted. Ms Ellis-On this side, John. be a bipartisan approach to this. We have to stop politicising the ABC. We have to allow the ABC to be truly independent. We have to fully fund the ABC. We have to stop stacking the board of the ABC. For too long this has gone on under Labor governments and under coalition governments. I can see the member for Fairfax is in agreement with what I am saying. The time has arrived where we have to put all that behind us because of our concern for the public interest of Australia. As I alluded to earlier in this debate, if the ABC is allowed to wither on the vine we are going to get more of Mr Packer and more of Mr Murdoch, and that is clearly not in the public interest.

On the subject of media laws, I am all for opening the media laws to allow other players in and for Mr Packer and Mr Murdoch to go and find interests in industries other than communications. They truly have an enormous amount of power and influence in Australia. I have no problem with media proprietors from Europe or from North America controlling parts of our media. We have seen in the history of the Fairfax group of papers that the Herald flourished under Brierley and under Conrad Black, and can be properly managed. We do not need Mr doch buying Channel 7. We must all support the ABC. I will stand here in this parliamentuntil I am voted out-defending the ABC and imploring both sides of the House to get together and ensure that we truly support an independent and properly funded ABC. Thank you. the member for Lowe, I certainly do not see the answer to our localism and media diversity in the hands of the offshore operators of our media, given the sorts of things that are happening in regional radio at the moment, which I will mention in a moment. Talking of the budget allocation to the ABC, from a regional perspective one can only welcome the commitment of $17½ million per annum to regional ABC, but I suspect it has been targeted for political rather than cultural reasons. I hope it enables the local ABC to generate truly local programming and inject local regional items into national radio and television on a more regular basis. I remember the enthusiasm of the launch of ABC Online here at Parliament House several years ago when Brian Johns, the then chairman, unveiled the sorts of things that he hoped the ABC would be able to do on a regional basis, with local video inserts into web sites showing not only the local headlines but in vision the sorts of events that had been happening around there. This was far removed from the reality of the situation, where there have been cameras sitting in regional ABC offices for some time with no expertise there to operate them. I hope that, finally, we might see a move towards the ABC generating some video as well as more broadcast material from the regions. I endorse the comments of the member for Fraser about the demise of new Australian material on the ABC and his allusion to repeats of repeats of repeats of Fawlty Towers, et cetera. I must admit I cannot get much of a laugh from Fawlty Towers these days. With a 2,500strong local petition delivered to my office calling for, among other things, funding to be restored to 1995 levels, I do not think that is an unreasonable request, given the demand for new technologies-the online, the digital and so on-that have developed since those quite savage budget cuts of the mid-1990s. The need for a strong, independent ABC is quite obvious now in a regional sense. In recent times, we have seen a serious decline in localism in both commercial radio and commercial television in regional areas. As one with a long background in regional radio and television, I feel more than competent to speak on it. An inquiry has almost been completed into the decline of localism in regional radio, where long-standing AM licences have been turned into slave stations of a city-based network. FM licences-too many of them-were introduced into most regional centres under the name of competition. What we have in many cases is a monopolisation of the market by similar interests-and I refer here particularly to the Daily Mail group-and a reduction of local content to bare, minimal proportions. In television, the demise of Prime Television news services in three major centres after years of cutbacks and the forcing of generic material onto others has so diluted localism in all markets as to make an absolute joke of the reasons for the Labor government’s aggregation policies of the late 1980s.

419,Mr Andren (Calare) (4.34 P.m.),"While I sympathise with many of the comments fromWednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28221 vertising market to absentee owners and to sacrifice local employment and content for halfhour strip network programming. MightI say, along with this, we see the demise of quality training of young journalists, broadcasters and announcers who once were the source of talent for the city stations. They are not taking on their responsibilities for training people. They are relying on the Charles Sturts of this world to train their young journalists, who in turn have fewer and fewer opportunities to do their work experience at the regional stations where their training was honed, if you like. WIN Television and the other Nine Network affiliates are the only operators consistently providing local news services to all their markets. However, even that is a long way short of the varied news, sport and entertainment that localism once provided under the licence requirements in the former incumbent regional station markets. (Extension of time granted) I remember preparing details for licence renewal hearings that would require a listing of towns and shires, and the number of stories, the number of information programs and so on that you had provided for all of those. It was a very worthwhile exercise-time consuming, but one that constantly reminded the licensee of his or her responsibility to that market. That sort of thing does not occur any more, and I ask: why? Members of the former government may want to promote the virtues of aggregation and say that this government is now standing mutely by while TV and radio services are delocalised, but there was never any intention to do other than maximise returns from licence sales and let the media operators do as they wish. The Ten Network affiliates were at least quite honest about what they regarded aggregation as-simply a licence to print money, with nothing by way of localism returned. They have never provided a news service in anything other than their incumbent market. The taxpayer should be informed that the Prime Network alone received $32 million of public funds to help it gear up for aggregation and will receive a $56 million subsidy, as far as I can ascertain, to ease it into the digital world. Also, it can ride on the back of the Seven Network’s signal in those markets where it was not the incumbent. The Ten Network affiliates in similar circumstances have taken similar public funding and run, with no regulatory framework to insist on localism. What we need, but no government is inclined to take on the media owners, are regulations requiring adequate and comprehensive localism from each licensee in each market; not contributing to but providing localism-and that is the key point. Anything else, any other inquiry recommendation from the radio inquiry now under way, would be, to use the Prime Minister’s current favourite term, pure humbug. I want to move quickly on to Telstra and rural communications. I opened the Telstra Countrywide office last week in Orange. While it is good to have people on the ground who can listen to the problems and see the frustration and delays in connections and repairs, it is but a reincarnation of Telecom local offices, minus the corporate knowledge of that network. That is what they are lacking, Minister: the corporate knowledge. If you pick up the phone and ring Gavin Priestley, the manager in Orange, and have a chat to him, I think he would quite frankly admit that they came in there not knowing the extent of the network or how many repairs they had. They had contractors coming in to dig the trench and they found that they did not have enough capacity on the line. That is in suburbs of Bathurst; it is not at Tibooburra. Gavin Priestley knows the extent of the problem now but he does not have the resources to do the job. Local subcontractors are being kept on a drip, fed by major contractors such as Lucas and Thiess, who are giving them unsustainable rates. Telstra continues to be top heavy and is only just beginning to come to grips with the work needed to bring rural telecommunications up to speed. That includes areas within 25 kilometres of the Bathurst Post Office. 28222 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 Ms HOARE (Charlton) (4.43 p.m.)-In the short time available to me to address the issues within this portfolio, I would like to talk about Telstra, and emphasise the fact that the budget still includes the proceeds from the sale of Telstra in aggregate form in the headline cash balance from 2002-03. Previously the proceeds were included from 2000-01. Estimated proceeds from the sale have never been disclosed in any detail. Although still unsatisfactory, Budget Paper No. 1 does provide some information about the estimated net impact of revisions since the mid-year economic forecasts on the fiscal and underlying cash balances. The bottom line is that the government is trying to have its cake and eat it too. On the one hand it says that Telstra will only be sold after satisfactory implementation of the Besley measures, but on the other hand it is keen to keep it in the budget, potentially to use the estimated proceeds in the election campaign. Back in July 1999 Brian Toohey writing in the Sydney Morning Herald forecast this when he said: With the telecommunications giant valued on the sharemarket at more than $110 billion, Telstra could easily be capitalised at well over $120 billion by the time the next election is due in 2001. Brian Toohey on that occasion had it right. Two years down the track, that is exactly what this government is doing. This is a double standard and, should this mean and tricky government be re-elected, it surely will push ahead with the sale of Telstra. I am sure members will be aware that in recent days Telstra announced planned changes to its local call zones. It is astonishing that the minister, Senator Alston, has claimed credit on behalf of the government for Telstra’s response to Telstra’s own call zone review. Surely, any benefit that this government can claim for Telstra’s response can only have come about because of the government’s majority ownership of Telstra, and remember that, in the unfortunate circumstance that the government is returned at the next federal election and it goes through with the full privatisation of Telstra, this ability to encourage or influence Telstra to improve its services to the people of Australia will be lost. Senator Alston has also claimed that it would be a recipe for disaster for a majority government owned Telstra to play a nation building role as advocated by the Leader of the Opposition. Again, it is interesting to note that the minister advocated such a role for Telstra recently. He said the government certainly sees telcos as having a crucial role to play in nation building. What extraordinary hypocrisy from the minister. However, there is another example that I would like to raise of this government’s attitude to the government ownership of Telstra. Recently, Cable and Wireless announced the sale of Optus to SingTel, a company with majority ownership by the Singaporean government. It seems that it is all right for a telco to be owned by a government as long as it is not the Australian government. SingTel and Telstra are both excellent examples amongst others around the world of very effective telecommunications carriers partially owned by the public. In March this year, we saw the dividend that has been paid to the government by Telstra. When Telstra cemented its position as Australia’s biggest earning company, reporting a record $2.6 billion after-tax profit for the six months to December 2000, a $500 million dividend cheque went to the government as Telstra’s 50.1 per cent majority owner. But at that stage, the Prime Minister backed away from full privatisation saying that the government would not sell its stake until services in the bush were fixed, and in March he said, ‘I am not satisfied at present.’ However, in May it is there in the budget papers. The Prime Minister, if he is re-elected, will sell Telstra at any cost. Despite this government’s blatant and shameless hypocrisy, the full privatisation of Telstra will be a reality in the final year of the next parliament, should the Howard government be reWednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28223 elected. The government had decided to put the sensitive issue of privatisation on the backburner, but the public remains committed and the Labor Party remains committed to the preservation of the remainder of Telstra under public control as the only guarantee of quality service. Ms HALL (Shortland) (4.48 p.m.)-In rising to make my very brief comments, I am sure that the minister will be enthralled with my contribution and will give me the assurances that I need. appointed with the treatment that the ABC received in the budget. I feel that it behoves the government to properly fund the ABC and to ensure its independence. Since it was elected, it has continually attacked the ABC and eroded its funding base. The other aspect of the ABC that I really want to raise-and I am very pleased that the minister is here-is the attack on the independence of the ABC. I think that there is nothing more important than that we have an independent public broadcaster, a broadcaster that is equally critical of the government and the opposition, a broadcaster that says things that upset both sides of politics. My argument is that you do not censor those sort of comments, because I really believe that they are very important in a democratic society. The government’s action in stacking the board and giving jobs to its mates, who in turn give jobs to their mates, has really attacked the independence of the ABC. I ask the minister and the government to look at that and return the ABC to its independence and the status that we should have in a national broadcaster. I would quickly like to touch on the subject of commercial television. This has been brought to my attention over the last week or so particularly, with Prime removing its local news services from Newcastle, Canberra and Illawarra. This is a real blow for our community, because this was the one source of competition between news services within our areas. We have NBN, which provides an excellent service, but to get a truly local service you need some sort of competition and you need to have different views being put to the public. I have written to the minister, Senator Alston, asking him to launch an urgent public inquiry into the cessation of Prime’s local news service and the effect that this will have on their licensing. It is my understanding that, when they were granted the licence, there was some obligation that they would provide a local news service. This is very disappointing for the people of the Hunter-and, I know, for those in Canberra and Illawarra as well-so I urge the minister to do what he can to try to ensure that there is competition and that an alternative news is being broadcast by local news services in regional areas. This is a government that pays lip-service, I am sure, to providing services in the regions. If they are really serious about it, they will get in there and ensure that the regional areas of Australia have strong local news services. Finally, I would like to touch on Telstra. I welcome the changes to the zones but, in doing so-and as somebody who called for the government to look at those zones because the Central Coast area, part of which falls within the electorate of Shortland and has been disadvantaged by those zones, as have people living in the Lake Macquarie and Swansea areas who have not been able to call other areas of Newcastle and the Hunter-I am disappointed because the changes are so selective. The people who are in the Central Coast part of the Shortland electorate will still not be able to enjoy the benefits enjoyed by the people living in Robertson. I question whether that may be because Robertson is held by a member of the government and the government is trying to shore up that seat for itself in the next election. I also",194,Committee

Firstly, I would like to make a brief comment on the announcement made at question time by the Prime Minister that the ABC would be given $15 million annually-for a number of years, as I understand it-to re-establish Australian television to Asia. Asia from the ABC studios in Darwin. It was terrific. You mugs came into office in 1996, and what did you do? You got rid of it. Not only that: you sold off the Radio Australia antenna at Cox Peninsula. Now, what have we had over the last little while? Renegotiations by the ABC on behalf of Radio Australia to get access to the Cox Peninsula antenna, so that they can broadcast back into Asia. Secondly, we now have an announcement this afternoon-writ large-that the government has made a terrible mistake by not allowing the ABC to continue Australian television when it should have been doing it from 1996 onwards. As a result of the stupidity of this government, there has been huge embarrassment for Australia in terms of our relationship with South-East Asia and in terms of the community’s need to know. What have they done? This outfit is very progressive. The only person who supported this position, Shane Stone, who was Chief Minister of the Northern Territory when the ABC was given the responsibility for running Australian television, bagged it. He is the progressive who is now the President of the Liberal Party, which gives you some commentary on where the Liberal Party is coming fromwe have seen again this afternoon how the government has recycled Labor Party initiatives because it is unable to sustain the initiatives it put in place itself.

WhatI want to pay particular attention to this afternoon is the Remote Air Services Subsidy, RASS, for Australia Post. An issue on which I hope the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation can respond-and if he cannot respond I would like him to get back to me about it-is the question of remote communities who are currently receiving the RASS and what happens to them when the company providing the air service pulls out.",197,Representatives Main Committee

434,Mr Snowdon,"Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker: he does not know what he is talkingWednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28225 I have in mind a particular circumstance, the community of Kaltukatjarra, in the southwestern corner of the Northern Territory. They have been informed recently by Ngaanyatjarra Air, who have been providing them with Australia Post services twice a week, that they will no longer be provided with an air service. As a consequence, at the end of June they will no longer have access to mail. I hope the minister is listening, because potentially we are seeing, at the end of next week, a remote community in the Northern Territory no longer getting access to their mail by air. The difficulty we have here is that although RASS applies to the region there is no carrier. There is no carrier currently flying into this community. I would ask the minister to ascertain how we can ensure that this community will not, as of the end of June, be denied a mail service, the right of every Australian. We are talking about a community of some 300 or 400 people. In the past-and this goes over into another portfolio area-Ngaanyatjarra Air have supplied the service on the basis that they could carry passengers, and they carried those passengers and delivered mail to remote communities. What has happened subsequently is they have been denied the right to carry passengers on these services unless the planes become regular passenger planes on regular service schedules. They cannot do that because of the state of the airstrips. (Extension of time granted) This issue, which has been raised with the Department of Transport and Regional Services, is significant because not only will it affect Kaltukatjarra but it could affect other communities in the very near future. The bottom line is that we as a community have a responsibility to ensure that communities, wherever they might be, have access to a mail service. If there is no ability to fly the mail into this community some 900 kilometres south-west of Alice Springs, it seems to me incumbent on the government and Australia Post to ensure that the people there get their regular mail services in some way. I am happy to provide the minister with appropriate information about that if he requires it. In fact, I will write him a note and ensure he gets a copy of it tomorrow. I would like a response as soon as possible because, clearly, this community will be affected as of the end of next week. The other issue which I want to raise and which I have raised in this place on a number of occasions is in the area of telecommunications. I am a great supporter of Telstra and Telstra Countrywide. But I am not a great supporter of some of the decisions which have been made by the Telstra board, one of those decisions being to sell off its Commander phone system. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I have raised this in the parliament before. What it meant was that, by selling off a portion of its business to a company of which it owned 30 per cent, it effectively privatised the business and started to charge people the full cost of providing a service. I will give you an example. The Ngadunggay Homelands Resource Centre was quoted a purchase price for a new Commander phone system of $2,582 plus an estimated $300 service fee for installation. Then there was to be a discount of $120 for the old equipment, and then travel costs for the installation, of $2,450. This has arisen because Telstra personnel can no longer put in place these services. This not only affects remote Aboriginal communities but also businesses in remote parts of Australia. PlesTel and PlesTel’s agents are only in Darwin and Katherine and Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. For the travel from Darwin or Katherine or Alice Springs to wherever the community might be, they are charging the travel time, the cost of the travel, plus the time on the job. Remember, these people previously had a contract with Telstra. Telstra put in place the systems. Now we are in a situation where these people are being penalised for the fact that Telstra has sold a part of its business. 28226 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 I am advised, Mr Deputy Speaker, and through you to the minister, that it is possible that the PABX system may go the same way in the future. Of course, because I am talking to a minister who says he knows something about regional Australia, he would understand the import and the impact of selling off these little bits of Telstra bit by bit and then charging full costs to clients when these bits are sold off in such a way, and what it means in terms of the cost structure of small business and of community based organisations such as those that predominate in Aboriginal communities. The answer is pretty simple. Telstra has got to assert its right to ensure that its technicians are compelled to and can fix Commander phone systems, whether by licence or by agreement with PlesTel. They ought to do it as soon as possible. This is one of the very reasons why people in remote Australia will not tolerate the further sale of any bit of Telstra. WhatI say to the government and the minister, is that, if they believe that somehow or other the community believes it is advantaged by what they have done with Telstra and the fact that Telstra is now selling off little bits of itself to companies of which it is a part owner, I think they are sadly mistaken. The community is not being advantaged by it; it is being handicapped by it. To my way of thinking we ought to be contemplating what ‘universal service obligation’ properly means. I do not believe it means the right for Telstra to withdraw services and then compel people in these remote communities to pay full costs. Something must be done about it immediately. (Time expired) (5.03 p.m.)-I was unable to be here for the entire debate as I was detained in the House on a totally spurious matter of public importance on the ABC. Some of the themes have been rehashed here again this afternoon during this particular debate. SoI was spared the ill informed, totally mischievous contributions by Labor Party members. Sadly, I did not miss them entirely, as I had to endure the members for Charlton, Shortland and the Northern Territory. I will work backwards as best I can and look at each of those members’ contributions. The problem with dealing with the member for the Northern Territory is that he believes his own misrepresentations. He is one of those people who rewrite history to suit their own political point of view. ATV, Australia Television in Asia, was Michael Lee’s and David Hill’s biggest folly. I have not looked at the files-even if they were available to me-but Michael Lee, as communications minister, must have signed off on the contractual aspects of that. That was in deep financial trouble long before we came into government, and it was the ABC that unloaded it onto Channel 7. You make the accusation that as soon as the coalition government came to power, we disbanded or transferred-or some generalised accusation like that-ATV broadcasting into Asia. So there you go. It is a very good thing that the government believe that there should be a presence now. I am not going to get sidetracked. I want to deal with the one serious matter that the member for the Northern Territory raised, and that was on behalf of a constituent body, a remote community, that is at risk of losing their postal services. Isn’t it interesting that he raises this a week before it happens? The member for the Northern Territory comes into the Main Committee and says the government have a deadline of one week to save the postal services of this remote community, which I want to do. What has he been doing on this issue? He has been asleep at the wheel-one week! What sort of local member are you to just unload it? Where are the papers? Has the member done anything with Senator Alston, the relevant minister? Of course not; so much grandstanding. How unlucky are they to have you representing them?

435,Mr Mcgauran (Gippsland,"Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation)Wednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28227 the moment, apart from the brief notification you have given, we know nothing about the issue. The Labor Party gave the usual generalised criticism of Telstra. The interesting thing about Telstra is that the Labor Party will not come clean on this. Just what is it that you plan for Telstra? Will it be by way of direction? Will the Labor Party do something that they never did in 13 years in office and direct Telstra under legislative powers to allocate resources in certain areas or for certain purposes? Of course not, they are bluffing. It was the Labor Party in 1990 that required Telstra to act as a commercial entity, as a business in competition with competitors. The Labor Party are just grandstanding. Let us move on to the member for Shortland, who started by saying that she is disappointed by the budget’s treatment of the ABC. It seems that $17.5 million new, extra funding for the ABC is not enough. How much is the Labor Party going to give the ABC? Ms Hall interjectingI asked the member for Perth the same question in the House this afternoon and he would not say. What we do know is that the Friends of the ABC-or the friends of the ALP, ACT chapter-have published a newsletter in which they paraphrased Bob McMullan. He tried to distance himself from their representation of this comments after question time by way of personal explanation. That was not very convincing at all-a very gobbledegook explanation. What they said is that he opened a meeting by telling them not to expect ‘too much too soon’. That is typical Labor Party strategy-giving the impression of promising the world to one and all but not committing to any specifics. With regard to the comments from the member for Shortland about the ABC, all who cherish the ABC know that the $17.5 million extra per year is a good thing. It is in addition to the $15 million extra announced today for each of five years with regard to television broadcasting into Asia. The bottom line on this-and just one phrase says it all-is that the coalition’s funding for the ABC is $96.5 million more than Labor’s last budget for the ABC. (Extension of time granted) Is there anybody on the opposition side who would like to contest that figure, that the coalition’s funding for the ABC is $96.5 million more than their last budget? The member for Shortland pleaded with the government not to interfere with the independence of the ABC. She believes the ABC should be equally critical of the government and the opposition. In fact, the ABC is more critical on this issue of independence of the Labor Party than it is of the coalition. I presented a statement by Brian Johns, the then chief executive officer, to the House in February of last year. The headline read ‘ALP attacks independence of the ABC’. He went on in the statement to criticise severely, in unambiguous terms, the member for Perth for threatening the independence of the ABC. The problem is that the ALP has form on this issue. Whether it is Greg Turnbull, press secretary to Kim Beazley, personally intimidating Mark Willesee of A Current Affair and warning him that the ALP will remember this in government or whether it is the ALP’s policy of tied grants to the ABC, it is the ALP threatening the national broadcaster’s independence. The problem with this whole ABC debate that has been generated by members of the ALP and the Friends of the ABC is that it is so much hype. It is exaggeration built upon generalisation. Tell us, member for Shortland, where there are examples of a coalition threat to the independence of the ABC. Give us some examples. At least do us the honour of telling us what actions of the government threaten the ABC’s independence. Ms Hall-Take a look at the board for a start, and its appointments.",200,Representatives Main Committee
436,Mr Mcgauran,"You will not say because you are not going to give the ABC anything.28228 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 Brian Johns are all paid-up Labor Party strategists. The member for Lilley must be smiling because he would have had a lot of experience with Rod Cameron, who was the party’s pollster for many years and who profited very nicely from government contracts. He knows very well that the ALP interfered at board level with the ABC. On the departure of the last remaining ALP appointee to the ABC board, a Mr Bates, he said on 6 February this year in the Sydney Morning Herald that he did not believe that the coalition appointments to the ABC board meant that political considerations were placed ahead of the interests of the ABC. So you might like to find some examples of how we have acted politically in terms of our appointments to the ABC, which were necessary because we have been in government for five years and some of the board members’ terms had expired. I am afraid the member for Shortland is like everyone else on the other side; she just makes generalised accusations and thinks and hopes they will stick. With the help of the CPSU and the Friends of the ABC, you believe that they will. The member for Charlton-this was a great classic-said that, because the possibility of the full privatisation of Telstra is included in the budget papers, that means the government must be committed to it. Does she realise that all privatisations by this government have gone to reducing Labor’s $96 billion debt, which has now been reduced by $60 billion, and that we do not take it off the recurrent funding? In other words, no privatisation affects the funding of the budget. Do you understand that? Every time the Labor Party privatised a government business or entity, they would use it for recurrent funding. Speaker has issued a general warning in the other place, and that is transferable to this place. Standing order 55 says that members are able to stand and speak without interruption. of grandstanding by the member for the Northern Territory in regard to Telstra. He said that the universal service obligation should be employed to greater effect. Upon coming to government, we strengthened the universal service obligation very considerably, and we have instituted the customer service guarantee-both things that Labor did not do in their 13 years in government. No doubt it was another 14th-year-in-government initiative which was on the member’s and the former government’s agenda. I think the Minister for Community Services is getting impatient. I am just beginning to warm up. I have got a lot more to say about a lot of other things. (Extension of time granted) I undertake to my colleague and friend that this will be my last five-minute session. Let me keep dealing with the member for Charlton. So with respect to the debt of $96 billion left to us by the Labor Party, we have reduced it by two-thirds, using privatisation as the major mechanism to achieve that necessary outcome. With respect to Telstra, I notice every now and then we read in newspapers that Labor Party strategists are predicting that Telstra is a winner; that Telstra is red hot out there and they can use Telstra as an issue to attack the government. We have seen a lame attempt by the member for the Northern Territory and the member for Charlton to do that here today. Country people are very pragmatic about Telstra. They remember Telecom and the PMG. What they want are legislative and regulated minimum service guarantees and the like.

So it is all the government’s fault when anything happens in communications, as evidenced by the attack by the member for the Northern Territory today in regard to Telstra. It is all our fault if there is some decrease in service, some failed connection, some delayed repair, but when they announce a major initiative that will benefit hundreds of thousands of country people, it has nothing to do with the government. You can’t have it both ways. Let me deal quickly with the comments by the member for Calare. He spoke at great length about aggregation. This was entirely predictable. I was part of those debates in the late 1980s. We pleaded with and begged the government of the day, ‘Don’t aggregate.’ They gave in to their big network mates. Make no mistake about this: anyone who was around at that time will tell you what was driving this policy, and I do not think it is talking out of school to say that the minister for communications at the time, Michael Duffy, was never very comfortable with the special deals that Hawke and Keating struck with the broadcasters at that time. We knew what aggregation would do to regional broadcasters, and it all happened within a matter of years. I do not know why the member for Calare, in the year 2001, 10 or 12 years after the event, expresses concern. We predicted this at the time; it happened very quickly. What is happening to Prime’s local TV service at the moment is very regrettable. He had a go at Countrywide. He is wrong on Countrywide, and I am happy to work to convince him otherwise. I have had Countrywide in my electorate for about six to eight months. It is the best thing that could have happened. Peter Ward heads the most dedicated people. They criss-cross the electorate; they visit people in their homes. It does not matter how remote you are, they will go to your doorstep and help you with connections or with mobile phone coverage. They are a great organisation. We have just announced the upgrade of 53 exchanges throughout Gippsland. I do not get many chances to speak about Golden Beach, which is a small community of about 300 people, but we launched the first upgrade of those 53 Gippsland exchanges there only last week. I implore the member for Calare to give Countrywide a chance. It is the real McCoy. With respect to the comments by the member for Lowe, we have heard all of this beforethe ABC’s independence, concentration of media by Packer and Murdoch. Well, fine, but the trouble is there is only so much breast beating allowable before it gets very repetitious and you devalue the currency. I should really have dealt longer with the remarks by the member for Fraser, because he is the shadow minister for the arts. But the problem is that I have heard it all before. It was a very unoriginal contribution. Of course, money was not mentioned; he just listed the problem areas while providing no solutions in policy terms, let alone in funding terms. You are not going to get away with this. You try to be all things to all people; you promise the world and there is never a dollar figure attached to it. As the Treasurer said not long ago, he is going to remind opposition members of this day in and day out. In that he will be aided by each and every one of his colleagues. The member for Fraser spent some time on the book industry and parallel imports. He has once again allied himself to special interests, against the interests of consumers. Parallel importing of books is in the interest of consumers; parallel importing of CDs was also in the interest of consumers. We were told the world would collapse; it has not. Quite frankly, the member for Fraser is just a mouthpiece for special interests against the interests of the broader community. Apart from that, I thank the member for Calare for his contribution. Proposed expenditure agreed to. 28230 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 Department of Family and Community Services Proposed expenditure, $2,833,202,000. budget was its failure to do anything for struggling Australian families. As we know, families provide the learning and caring environment for children that enhances their chances of success and our economic stability. But our families are under threat. First of all, I think they have been hit for six by the GST. Under the government’s GST, families are paying more for the necessities of life-things like children’s clothes and electricity. They are also paying more for many other goods. The ABS consumer price index shows electricity is up 12 per cent, gas is up 10.4 per cent, insurance is up 35 per cent, telephone bills are up seven per cent, whitegoods are up 5.8 per cent, medicines are up six per cent, sporting fees are up 12.2 per cent, children’s shoes are up 7.3 per cent, kids’ glasses are up 6.4 per cent, bread is up four per cent, kids’ haircuts are up 11.7 per cent, petrol is up 7.8 per cent, books are up 9.2 per cent and education is up 4.5 per cent. The budget ignores these pressures on families that arise squarely from the imposition of the GST, and the government did not take the opportunity to address the looming family payments crisis that will see debts raised against low income families from July. This appropriation bill contains no item that will address the very real problems that lie at the heart of the government’s family payments system. The government claims that it is family friendly because it will index family payments on 1 July, but in a mean clawback the government is going to recoup much of this amount by hitting struggling families with many family payment debts that will come out of their tax returns. As always, what John Howard gives with one hand he takes away with the other. Families whose income has changed during this financial year face debts at tax time of up to $1,000 because of the legislation introduced with the GST. There are three family payments that are affected by the government’s new system which was supposed to be simple and fair: family tax benefit part A, family tax benefit part B and child-care benefit. The appropriation for these three payments will total approximately $11.5 billion in the coming financial year, so it is important that the money is fairly administered but it is not. For each of the three family payments, families have been asked to estimate their income a year in advance. These are the only government payments that operate on a yearly estimate made in advance. Because the government’s new system is a zero tolerance one, every dollar they underestimate their income by will produce a debt, as compared to the previous system where a 10 per cent tolerance was allowed. The government now has a zero tolerance family policy, which is going to be very tough on many low income Australian families, and if a family contacts Centrelink to revise their estimate of income during the year, this will not necessarily prevent them from incurring a debt after 1 July this year. To give you the size of the potential problem, you need to look at how many families are getting these payments and how many have changing income over the financial year. There are 1.8 million Australian families getting family tax benefit A, while 1.2 million families get family tax benefit B and 500,000 families receive child-care benefit. Senator Vanstone’s department has said that up to May 833,000 families had registered income changes during the present financial year, and so many of these people do not yet know that after July they will face a hefty bill from the government. You can safely assume from the department’s advice that some of these 833,000 may have changed their estimates more than once. Families in which there is a shift worker or someone working casually are likely to have a great many fluctuations in their income over the course of a year-something the government’s payment rules try to ignore.",202,Representatives Main Committee
441,Mr Swan (Lilley) (5.19 P.m.),"The gaping hole in the middle of the government’s recentWednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28231 The trouble is that the government will not come clean on how big the problem could be. The department has admitted in estimates hearings that around 200,000 of the 500,000 childcare benefit payments may produce debts, but they are unable to tell us how many of the three million FTB A and FTB B payments will produce debts for customers at tax time. They guess it is less than 40 per cent, but they are not sure. So all we know is that they expect less than 1.2 million payments to be affected. If history is any guide, the problem is big. The minister’s own departmental annual report records that there were 51,000 debts raised against families in 1999-2000, an average of $955 per family, and that was before the government’s zero tolerance family policy was introduced. The government could have addressed the problems at the core of its zero tolerance approach in the budget, but it did nothing and actively chose to do so. Instead, Centrelink officers, at the direction of the government, are telling families who come in to change their income estimate to falsely overestimate their income to try and make a dent in the debt that they are going to get at tax time. It is just another tricky approach for the government to avoid its responsibilities. (Extension of time granted) In some cases, they are telling them to cancel their payments so they can avoid a debt at the end of the year. Put simply, the government is encouraging families to mislead to save its own political hide, and they have to sign the form to cement the government’s deception. It is quite a unique situation. You have Minister Anthony only a few weeks ago crowing about Centrelink fraud detection figures, which include families who innocently incur family payment debts. It is not just Minister Anthony. The government has been very tricky and sneaky all along when it comes to family payments. Senator Vanstone insinuated in April that only families rorting the system would receive debts because of massively underestimating their income. She falsely claimed that a family would have to underestimate their income by $18,000 to receive a debt of $1,000. However, a yearly income estimate from a family could be out by as little as $1,500 to incur a $1,000 debt for one child. For a family earning $30,000, this amounts to an error of just five per cent. For the government, being 95 per cent just is not good enough. That is a direct result of its zero tolerance family policy. Debts accrue against each payment the family receives, not just the child-care benefit. Either the minister is not across the detail of her portfolio or she was being deliberately misleading when she made those statements. So you have ministers out there trying to paint the families who are innocently caught up in this system as fraudsters to ease the political pressure from the debts that they have created through their new system, and you have Centrelink, on instruction from the government, telling families to falsely estimate their income. The problem is that, for too many families, the government’s family payment system is very unfair. It is a dog and it bites. Olaf Meier, from Crestmead in Brisbane, has had his income increased from $32,700 to $35,950. He is facing a debt of around $700. He and his family are doing it pretty tough. They have just bought their home and they cannot afford not to be receiving family payments through the year. But now they face a debt approaching $1,000, courtesy of the Howard government’s zero tolerance family payment rules, and there are tens of thousands of families like the Meier family. These families cannot afford to provide an overestimate of their income, as Centrelink is directing, because they just cannot make ends meet day to day, week to week. These families, the ones who are doing it toughest, are at the top of the list to get $1,000 or more in debts in July or August this year. Many more families do not know about the debt problem, and they are going to find out for the first time what they owe when the tax office comes back to them with a bill instead of a cheque in July and August. Families receiving family tax benefit B, a payment to help a dependent spouse caring for a child, are also a real problem. It is this payment that produces the debt for families when a 28232 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 spouse moves into the work force during the financial year. Just today, Professor Peter Macdonald has come out in a Monash University journal to explain the consequences of this payment on the lives of Australian families and the implications for Australia’s birthrate. Peter Macdonald’s work makes very clear why the government should have done something about the family payment system in the budget. He explains how the family tax benefit B payment penalises dual income families, which many young families are these days, forcing one parent to remain at home. Macdonald points to the case of a couple with a young child where the husband is earning $45,000 and the wife wants to return to work for 12 hours a week to help with the extras. From the $204 she would earn each week, the wife would lose $16 in tax, $20 in transport costs, $30 in child-care costs and $50 in family tax benefit B. Put simply, she would be working for $88 a week. If, however, her husband takes on an extra 12 hours a week, the family gains $225 a week in extra income. According to Macdonald, this means the payment rewards families where the husband absents himself more and more from his family. How perverse can you get. Our Prime Minister’s world and the world of Minister Anthony and Minister Vanstone is the world of the 1950s, where wives may have stayed at home while fathers worked nine to five and had constant incomes. But the rest of us, Minister, are living in the 21st century, where Australian families are trying to survive with intermittent overtime, casual work and a 10 per cent GST. So despite all of the admissions by the minister’s department in estimates hearings and all of the families coming forward with evidence that they are about to be saddled with debts, the government continues to pretend that anyone getting a debt is some kind of cheat, and that is deeply insulting to these hard working Australians. Just a week ago, Senator Vanstone claimed the government was very family friendly. She put out this statement saying ‘Family friendly government’. (Extension of time granted) She claimed that her system of family payments ‘is a fair and equitable policy that will enable families to receive what is rightly theirs’. She said that it reflects the Howard government’s commitment to pay people what they are entitled to-no more, no less. Once again, there is the clear implication that people who receive debts are doing it deliberately. Once again, there is the smear that these people may be defrauding the system and are not victims of this government’s system. The fact is that this minister is determined to prop up an unfair zero tolerance family payments system by blaming the struggling families who fall victim to it. The fact is that Australian families do not have crystal balls to predict their future income and most do not have the accounting software to deal with the government’s complicated zero tolerance family payments policy. John Howard is not supporting battling Australian families; he is out there creating more of them. Tens of thousands of families are being put under extreme financial pressure. Only someone as out of touch and cold-hearted as our Prime Minister and his ministers would introduce a family payments system that punishes families who work harder and punishes parents who return to work after taking time out to care for a child. John Howard’s zero tolerance family payments system is just another mean GST compensation swindle. John Howard’s zero tolerance family payments policy sits proudly alongside his other achievements-the bogus savings bonus and pension clawback-in the coalition’s GST compensation hall of shame. Ms HALL (Shortland) (5.31 p.m.)-This is a high taxing government, a government that has delivered a tax to the Australian people that is really affecting their lives. It is taxing families in a way that they have never been taxed before. I visited one of the schools in my electorate last week. When I arrived at that school the students asked me about the GST. When they asked me about the GST they identified the fact that they had started paying tax. They also identified their feeling that this was not the way it should be; rather, that you should Wednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28233 start to pay tax when you started work. They felt it was very unfair that they were being hit in this way. Probably the greatest disappointment to me in this budget was the fact that the government failed to acknowledge that they had dudded people who live in residential parks and caravan parks. They continue to impose this 5½ per cent GST on these very vulnerable people who are generally on fixed incomes. The Minister for Community Services, who is present in the chamber, knows about this, because he, like me, has a lot of residents who live in these parks. These people have made the decision to have this lifestyle. They are people who own their own homes. They are people who have invested significant amounts of money-some nearly as much as $200,000-in buying their homes. It was really brought home to me last weekend when I was talking to residents who were living in parks how hard it is for them. When the GST was introduced, a number of owners of parks imposed a rental increase; others imposed the GST. Now we are finding an about-face by some of those owners who applied the GST because they can see the writing on the wall. They see that the government may lose the next election, and if they lose the next election they know that the Labor Party has promised that the GST, that unfair GST that has been charged on people who are living in residential parks, will be removed. Because of that, I am finding that within the area that I represent park owners are sending letters to the residents saying, ‘We’ve decided the GST’s not the way to go, we’re going to put in place a rent increase.’ I think that the government should have admitted that it made a mistake. In admitting that it made a mistake, it should then, in this budget, have remedied that situation. (Extension of time granted) It has already rolled back the GST on excise. It has already had to introduce rollback in a number of areas-or, should I say, as I think it is more appropriate when I am referring to the government, rollover, because it is only when they have the pressure put on them through the polls and the ballot box that they actually revisit any of these issues. The minister should be very aware of this because of the electorate he represents. I would have thought that he would have been leading the fight for the residents of these parks because it will have an impact in his electorate. Even putting that aside, I think that on moral grounds he should be fighting for these people. I honestly do not see how members on that side of the House can live with the fact that the government is spending $20 million a month on advertising whilst, at the same time, it is hitting the most vulnerable people within our community with taxes like the GST on people in parks. The shadow minister spoke about the debts that are being levied against families. I have already seen some of those families-they are coming into my electorate office. The zero tolerance on debts incurred on the family benefits A and B is hurting families and will continue to hurt families. This matter needs to be revisited, Minister. You need to re-introduce the 10 per cent leeway. Because of the way this government has attacked the job market, more and more people are working in part-time and casual jobs and being forced to work long hours, and that does have an enormous effect on their incomes. It is very difficult to estimate how much you are going to earn when the hours you work vary from week to week. This is not a family friendly government. It is a government that uses all the rhetoric. It says, ‘We care about families. We are there for the family. We support family values,’ but it is nothing more than rhetoric. What it does support is being re-elected. What it does support is an outmoded picture of what it thinks Australia is and should be, and then goes about trying to achieve it by hitting the people that it is supposed to be supporting. I feel that the government has failed miserably in the area of family and community services. It has not looked after the 28234 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 people. It has not provided the support for the people in our community that are most vulnerable. The other area I should quickly touch on is the number of breaches that are being imposed by Centrelink. The simple fact that a large percentage of these breaches are administrative has been borne out by some of the answers that the minister has provided me with to questions in relation to the Shortland electorate and the people who have been breached there. Every day we have people coming into our electorate office who have been unfairly breached. It takes time, both within our office and within Centrelink, to actually turn around decisions that have been made by Centrelink. I think that the minister would do well to provide extra staff and extra training to Centrelink. Probably if he could give a little bit more support in that area it would be appreciated, not only by the staff at Centrelink but by the people that rely on Centrelink for their payments. pressed by some of my colleagues about the very great problems that are being caused to Australian families as a result of overpayments of family payment. I would like to raise a particular area of that collection procedure and that is the interrelationship between it and the Child Support Agency. This is a matter that I have already written about to Senator Vanstone and to the Treasurer and I will briefly outline the problem for the benefit of other members. The person who brought this to my attention had custody of her two children for most of the year. She had been claiming a full family tax benefit. Relatively late in the year, the residential arrangements for one of the children changed, so that that child then resided with his father, giving his father an entitlement to part of the family tax benefit for those two children for the year. That father had a child support debt to the mother of many thousands of dollars. Her concern was that her ex-husband would claim his share of the family tax benefit through Centrelink, and a debt would be raised against her, and Centrelink would not take that money and apply it against his child support debt. She had correctly assessed the situation, as I have subsequently found out from my own inquiries. thing is that, as the minister has just said, presently there is no legislative arrangement that links the Child Support Agency with Centrelink as far as debt collection goes. I then explored the issue of what would happen if the father claimed the money in his tax return. I thought, ‘There are links between the ATO and the Child Support Agency in relation to the resolution of child support debts.’ However, I found that the administrative arrangements are not as I would have expected. The father could put in his claim but, because the mother had claimed a full family tax benefit, the claim would be rejected. At that point, his income tax assessment would be issued. If, for other reasons, he had a repayment due to him of any tax, that would be applied against the Child Support Agency debt. However, in a lot of these cases fathers are in circumstances where they are not necessarily going to receive a refund and, therefore, the child support debt is not going to be dealt with at all. The next step is that the father has to apply for a review, so that he can get access to his share of the family tax benefit. When he does that and it is processed, a debt will be raised against the mother and the money will be paid to the father. At that point, there is no link between the tax office and the Child Support Agency for the purposes of clearing child support debts. So, the mother who is owed several thousand dollars by the father continues to be owed several thousand dollars by the father. He receives part of the family tax benefit-that is paid to him in his hand-and she has a debt raised against her. I think that is an extremely inequitable situation, and if the minister, as he has said, has some legislation coming forward that",204,Representatives Main Committee

ThenI would hope that he would also follow up the issue of the payment system with the tax office. (Time expired) debate, so it may be a little fragmented. However, I would suggest that the reaction out there after the budget is one of some cynicism even among those who have enjoyed some of the rewards of that budget. I think the general feeling is that, stung by the impact of the goods and services tax on pensioners, the government has moved to placate that sector with a targeted election year handout. I think that, if governments continue to use that sort of tactic, more and more people will gravitate to that 20-30 per cent of the population who are looking for candidates other than those from the major parties to represent them. You just cannot sit back and say, ‘Those preferences will drift back to us anyway so we do not have to worry about it.’ I think the political system has to worry very sincerely about the fact that there is a disillusioned 20 to 30 per cent out there who, I believe, will only be reinforced because of a repetition of a variation of the whiteboard hand-out mentality, if you like. I said on budget night that the one-off $300 handout for each person receiving a pension or part-pension looked like a blatant election bribe, and everything I have seen or heard since confirms that analysis. Those who got it can perhaps pay off their winter fuel bill-or part of it-in my electorate, where four per cent, with a sunset clause, compensation for the GST in the first place was never going to be enough, particularly in a rural cold winter electorate where fuel prices for heating, although not the government’s fault, have indeed gone through the roof. The costs have risen significantly post GST-some of it no doubt unexpected with those skyrocketing fuel prices-but just like the fine print had to be read with the famous promise of that $1,000 bonus to pensioners to compensate for the GST, so too the fine print had to be read with this budget bonus. Many missed out on the $1,000 and many have missed out on this. Disability support pensioners and non-pensioner carers or non-pension age carers also feeling the post-GST price hikes have angrily contacted my office to ask why they did not receive this payment. One constituent says: The recent announcement of a one-off payment to pensioners of $300 is (like the $1,000 GST bonus promise) again misleading and hurtful to many gullible enough to take the leader of the Australian people at his word. I am unaware of the ratio of aged pensioners to the sum of all other categories of pensioners, but that figure would closely reflect the number of vulnerable Australians hurt and disillusioned by the continued misrepresentation of the truth. He goes on: I am a disability support pensioner. ThatI can recognise the existence of the ambiguity/deception inherent in the continued misuse of the term ‘pensioner’ when it is intended not to apply to all pensioners, should at least call into question the candour of those so cavalier with its use. These words, among others, are from Paul Collins in my electorate. If there is one thing clear to me after six budgets in this place, it is the fact that all too often measures announced as black and white with such conviction on budget night, and reported as such the day after quite uncritically by the media, turn out to be ambiguous or deceptive on further analysis. As another example, self-funded retirees could have been forgiven for thinking after budget night that they would all benefit equally from the government’s proposed changes to the low income rebate system. But that was not the case, with income cut-offs meaning many self-funded retirees will receive no benefit whatsoever. In the same way as the much heralded scheme to allow farmers to pass on their property to their family failed to live up to its promise to enable 10,000 farmers to access the pensionand it would have if that rate had been of $800,000 value instead of half a million, but it deliv-",208,Representatives Main Committee

That real or perceived deceit is undoing much of the positive reaction the government might hope to gain from these initiatives and any amount of advertising will not turn this around. express concern for an organisation which has not been guaranteed funding in this budgetthat is, the Women’s Emergency Services Network. Today, I met with people from WESNET, the peak women’s organisation working to eliminate domestic and family violence. Some three years ago this organisation had its funding threatened. A lot of other peak organisations-such as AYPAC, in terms of the youth sector, Shelter in terms of social housing and the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation-have had their funding withdrawn by this government. WESNET’s funding runs out on 30 June and it needs the support of the government. I call upon the government and the minister to give it its funding, which is pretty minimal. The organisation has, for the last three years, been getting $110,000 per year. This amount was given after some pressure on the government but, nonetheless, it has enabled it to carry out its very important role. A letter to WESNET dated 18 May 1998 from the then Minister for Family Services-the then federal member for Bass, Warwick Smith-states: orities for work to prevent domestic violence and he is well placed to maintain and build on the momentum generated by the partnerships. In addition, I believe WESNET has the capacity to embrace the opportunity provided by these particular funds to conduct projects in research that may advance the work of the Taskforce in order to reduce the incidence of domestic violence and encourage better practice service responses to both victims and perpetrators. Having established the Australian Federation of Homelessness Organisations, it would be extraordinary for WESNET, as one of the bodies which make up AFHO, not to have its funding. That would leave a gaping hole; one we cannot afford to leave. Domestic violence is a crime and it is something all governments should be working towards eliminating. It is an issue which causes great pain and suffering to families in this nation. This government, through this measure, is showing what a compassionless government it is. WESNET currently only gets $13,000 in funding from the Australian Federation of Homelessness Organisations. This is funding specifically to have two conferences, as the national peak organisation, per year. The loss of funding will mean the expertise that WESNET has built up through its personnel will be lost, and once you lose those skills and that experience it is very hard to rebuild and get it back again. The government has not even notified WESNET or responded to correspondence from it over a period of months as to what it will do. Given it is just 10 days before that funding runs out, I call upon the government to find a heart, to take up the rhetoric of the Leader of the National Party in the joint party room yesterday. He raised domestic violence as a very important issue, at the same time as the government is defunding the peak organisation. This is an outrage. It is an outrage because of the impact that it will have. It is an outrage for what it says about the lack of government priorities and it is an outrage because of the failure of the minister, Senator Amanda Vanstone, to respond to correspondence that WESNET has sent. WESNET’s program is designed to ensure the safety of women and children, empower women to live free of violence and to improve the social, political and economic status of women. Surely, this organisation deserves the support of government. quite a few contributions to this debate today have been made by members of the opposition, but perhaps I can start with some of the contributions made by the member for Lilley.

447,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Minister for Community Services) (5.54 p.m.)-I know thatWednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28237 has had, particularly on families, and of course he was being very indignant about the dramatic increase in assistance that we have given, particularly to families, through the new taxation system. Part of that has been the substantial increases in family tax benefit. There was $2.2 billion of new money that came through after 1 July this year to compensate families for any possible price increase that might have come about due to the new taxation system$2.2 billion. For low income families, particularly for some of those receiving family tax benefit, that was an increase in the order of $40 to $50 per week in family tax benefit. We also increased family tax benefit part B. This was done to give families choice when one of the primary carers might not wish to enter the work force, and assistance is now given to those individuals. We do believe in choice, which is fundamentally important in the new taxation system. We have given them a substantial increase in funding through the family tax benefit, but there are also benefits to families, particularly through reductions in income tax rates, which are also substantial. But the best thing that this coalition government has done to assist families has been our stewardship over the last five years in ensuring that there has been a reduction in interest rates. These major reductions in interest rates-which are now at their lowest levels for decades-have meant that the cost of living is far more manageable for families, particularly mortgages. When Labor was at its zenith, particularly when the Leader of the Opposition was minister for finance, interest rates for home mortgages were at 17 per cent. So this has been a very family friendly budget, and these measures are certainly profamily. He also commented on the issue of reconciliation. Yes, we do have a policy to ensure that families get their estimates accurately. That is why we have now put on a lot more staff at Centrelink-to ensure that, if their circumstances do change, families can make contact either through their customer service centre or through the call centre to ensure that the estimates they get are correct. Under the old system, the Labor Party had 12 different types of payment for families-very complex and very confusing. We simplified that from 12 to three: family tax benefit part A, family tax benefit part B and child-care benefit-in which there has been a substantial increase. If we talk about child care, the last ABS statistics show that there has been a 10 per cent fall in the cost of child care. This has made it far more affordable than it ever was under the Australian Labor Party. Under reconciliation, for the first time if families underestimate their income-and they did not have this under the Labor Party-they will receive a top-up of up to 10 per cent. But we are conscious of the need for families to have their reconciliation accurate. That is why, through all the campaigns that we have run over the last couple of years, families are being educated about such things. Because they are receiving a lot more in taxpayers’ money through family tax benefit, we must ensure that their reconciliations and their estimates are correct. There are 2.2 million Australians who are receiving family tax benefit. Of those, 1.2 billion will receive family tax benefit part B, which is up to $108 per fortnight-and that is substantial. Regarding the comments made about fraud and detection figures, it is certainly this government that wants to ensure that taxpayers get their correct entitlement-not more, not less. We certainly will not tolerate individuals who deliberately go out of their way-not through wrong estimates-to try and defraud the Commonwealth and other taxpayers. (Extension of time granted) That is precisely why-because we have spent $56 billion in this budget-we have to ensure that taxpayers’ money is used accurately and appropriately. We do not step away from that, in contrast with the ramshackle days when the Department of Social Security was administered by the previous Labor government, where there was very little accountability. 28238 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 The member for Lilley also spoke about an article by a leading academic that appeared in the paper today-again, an article about family tax benefit. As I mentioned before, what I believe has failed to be acknowledged is that family tax benefit, particularly part B, is there to give families choice. It is there to give families an option in the event that both parents want to return to the work force or perhaps one parent wishes to stay at home, particularly when their child is young. And yes, we have weighted it. If one partner wishes to stay at home and look after their child who is under the age of five, then there is a substantial increase. But, of course, if that particular partner returns to the work force, there is a reduction there. I believe that is very family friendly, and I disagree with some of the content of Peter Macdonald’s article in the paper today. Talking about the savings bonus, it was this government that, for the first time, compensated older Australians for a reduction in purchasing power through the introduction of the new taxation system-and that was never ever done when the Australian Labor Party were in government, particularly with their constant increases in wholesale sales taxes. These were hidden taxes that continued to go up: from 10 to 12, from 20 to 22. On it went, a plethora of hidden taxes, with there being absolutely no compensation being given to any Australians. What did we do? We were quite deliberate, when the new taxation system came into place, in stating that if you had a certain amount of savings, if you had been thrifty-particularly an older Australian-you would be entitled to a saving bonus. AndI might add that the average payment for the savings bonus is around $743 and, from memory, that went to about 1.8 million Australians. That was substantial. There was also recognition given to self-funded retirees through the supplementary bonus, and that was payable up to $2,000. The previous government never gave any compensation for any of its failed tax policies and its broken promises with income tax cuts that occurred in 1983-84. Mr Griffin interjectingsale sales taxes were introduced? Absolutely not. The member for Shortland, as well meaning as perhaps she is, comes in here preaching virtues; she says that there has been a lack of attention to the job market. Why is it then that we have created 840,000 new jobs since our stewardship here? There have been more jobs created now. There is lower unemployment; it is now under seven per cent, and it was well over 11 per cent when the Leader of the Opposition was minister for employment. She talks about breaches. At least we have a gradual regime in place for Centrelink-it was never there under the Department of Social Security, which was administered by the Australian Labor Party. They had a one-breach policy: you got breached and you lost your total entitlement. Again, from memory, there were about 80,000 breaches in Labor’s last full year, with people losing their total entitlement. What we did was to introduce a gradual system whereby you had a number of warnings before you lost your total entitlement. That was part of a recommendation that came to us from ACOSS and other welfare groups because of the draconian types of policies that existed in that area before. As far as Centrelink is concerned, a comment was made about extra staff. We are putting on extra staff. There will be substantially more staff going on under Australians Working Together, which is the core package of this appropriation bill. This is a very good thing, because we are starting to tackle some of those individuals who have been left behind-mature age workers, long-term unemployed, and particularly those people who are on disability support. The area that the member for Kingston spoke about, which I thought was a constructive contribution-unlike some of the others-was the interrelationship between the Child Support Agency and the new family tax benefit scheme. I think he was perhaps also referring to elements of shared care. We do have amendments to legislation now-(Time expired)",210,Representatives Main Committee
448,Mr Anthony,"I will take that interjection. Was there any compensation when wholeWednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28239 minister’s dissertation and raise a few issues that he does not seem to have addressed in his own comments tonight. I will speak very briefly because it is getting late, but I will make a couple of points first. The main area of employment growth that appears to have been occurring under this government in recent times is that of advertising executives. We are talking about something like $120 million over the next six months being spent by this government in terms of advertising things that they have done, wish to do, or are misrepresenting. We are certainly talking about unchaining the wallets in this case. I bring up a particular example which relates to this portfolio area: some $4.1 million around the question of advertising for older Australians. The minister mentioned that there were different benefits going to different individuals and types of individuals. I will raise the issue about carers between the age of 55 and aged pension age, some 15,000 people. If we took the money that is being spent on advertising the government’s activities to older Australians, we could easily ensure that the $300 bonus went to those carers. We are not only getting TV, radio and newspaper as, we are also getting a personally addressed letter from Senator Vanstone. Now, I ask you: what older Australian deserves an addressed letter from Senator Vanstone? They will receive a copy of Centrelink’s Age Pension News. Age Pension News is sent directly to people in these circumstances and, basically, it outlines these same benefits. Surely that is enough. But not happy with actually sending letters out to people to explain once, twice and three times what they are getting, they also sent a bunch of letters to people who in fact were not getting anything. They went out there and basically sent letters to a range of people who, because of their age, were not going to receive the benefits that were outlined. So they are not only causing them to suffer by sending them a letter, they are also misinforming them in those letters. I think the minister ought to look at some of those issues and see that that is really what this government has been doing in recent times-wasting money in a profligate manner. but the contribution just made by the member for Bruce requires me to make a few brief comments. There has been an awful lot of hypocrisy flying around the joint lately on this business of government advertising. I have to say, first of all, that I do not accept the figures as put forward by the member for Bruce for the expected advertising expenditure over any future time span. Secondly, he calls into question the government’s credentials in terms of the need for advertising. I have to say that to the best of my knowledge the government, aided by the Public Service, which has a statutory requirement to follow guidelines, follows the advertising guidelines which were brought down in, I believe, 1993 by an Australian Labor Party led government. If those guidelines were good enough for Labor in 1993, I have no reason to find them suspect in 2001. They are good guidelines. They require honest responses. They require there to be a demonstrated need for the advertising. They require research to prove that this advertising is required. It needs to be budgeted, done properly and not be party political. The Australian Labor Party can crawl all they like and try to make cheap political points about government advertising. But there is a need to clearly explain to the community new services and new processes, not to deceive the public but to make sure they understand what their rights and their entitlements are, and what government programs have changed so that they know how their lives are going to change as a result. I wanted to put that on the record. We have had enough of this hypocrisy from the other side of parliament on this issue. Let us get down and debate substantive issues, in this case about the budget for the Department of Family and Community Services.",212,Representatives Main Committee

We’ve been pressing. Larry Anthony and I have been pressing in this particular area. We don’t know. We’ll have to wait and see. We have seen. It was not fixed. It shows how pathetic and hopeless the member for Page and the member for Richmond are at representing their constituents. Maybe the Minister for Community Services might respond now about why he has been so inadequate in representing the 6,649 residents in his electorate and the more than 3,000 in the electorate of Page. It is pathetic and it is the reason why Labor will win both Richmond and Page at the federal election. spond to some of that diatribe later on. I want to come back to some of the thoughtful contributions that the member for Kingston made regarding the interrelationship between the Child Support Agency and the family tax benefit. One of the things that we are trying to do now, which unfortunately is not getting the support of the Australian Labor Party, is to integrate the taper rates, one should say, between family tax benefit and child support. The changes that we put into place for family tax benefit, particularly for shared care, now mean that if you care for your children for more than 10 per cent of the time that will be reflected now in the family tax benefit. Under the old system of family payments you had to have 30 per cent care before you were recognised for any type of Commonwealth payment. That is the criterion that is also used in the Child Support Agency: you have to have care for more than 30 per cent of the time to see any reduction in your child support liabilities. We made a number of very sensible contributions and legislative changes to bring child support thresholds of 30 per cent down to 10 per cent, but they have been knocked back and not supported by the Australian Labor Party. I cannot understand the reason why. I see the member for Shortland is here, and she seems at times to be a compassionate lady. Why can’t",213,Representatives Main Committee

If yours are among the 860,000 children going through the Child Support Agency, if you are the payee or the payer, but particularly if you are the payer, and you have care for your kids for more than 10 per cent of the time, why can that not be reflected in the child support formula, because it does cost? Or how about 20 per cent of the time? But no, the Labor Party are opposed to that, which is bad policy, bad politics and bad for those kids growing up in these families, as many more families now seem to separate for all sorts of reasons. The member for Kingston acknowledged an issue in relation to the family tax benefit, and we are making changes to amend that. If you do not pay your child support payments and you have debts then you should not be entitled to the family tax benefit. These amendments will be debated in the Senate, if not tomorrow then certainly by the end of next week, and will ensure that, if you are not making your child support payments-you will be given the chance, of course, to rectify that-you will not receive your family tax benefit. The FTB is distributed through the Department of Family and Community Services, and we are trying to ensure that there is a relationship between the payments that are made from there and the Child Support Agency-which is ultimately an independent agency, but there is obviously a relationship there. It is sad because none of the speakers have contributed anything about the budget. There have been red herrings or references to particular social issues, but it is a shame that there has not been a contribution on the budget. The member for Calare, in his usual style, said how bad it was that we gave $300 to older Australians of pensionable age. What is wrong with that? It is a great thing. Actually, by tomorrow, up to 2.2 million people will be entitled to this, but at least 1.8 million pensioners will receive that $300. Ms Hall-You won’t buy their votes, though, Larry. for the contributions that they have made to this country. Of course, the other contribution we made was the $25,000 payment to war widows-something the Australian Labor Party never did. Then the member for Calare went on to talk about other price increases, particularly electricity price increases. He is probably best to look towards the state government in New South Wales, because they are controlling electricity. He also talked about fuel prices. It was this government that removed indexation, which was introduced by the Australian Labor Party 17 years ago. But, of course, many of the costs for fossil fuels are caused through their relation to international prices. He went on to talk about savings bonuses-which I have mentioned before-and about the disability support pension. The old age bonus was never intended for people on disability support pension. The bonus was age related: you had to be over 65 and of a certain income level. We have done an enormous amount for people with disabilities, and that will be happening in this budget. We believe it is important to focus on their abilities rather than their disabilities, and there have been substantial new places through the Australians Working Together program. (Extension of time granted) In conclusion, this has been a terrific budget as far as family and community services are concerned: $56 billion. There has been a major contribution for older Australians. There has been a big revamp of, and greater assistance to, Centrelink, which is doing a terrific job and I congratulate the agency. Of course, all the other reforms are making this country a stronger place. God help us if the Australian Labor Party were ever to regain the treasury bench.

In some hospitals they are not available at the moment. This matter came to my attention because a former constituent of mine had a son with a brain tumour who was airlifted to Adelaide. He rang my office very distressed because he had been told that his son had been placed on a waiting list for an MRI in order to find out the extent of his ill health. I spoke to the patient’s doctor, and he said, ‘Well, the problem is not that there is a waiting list. The problem is that there is no MRI machine at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital in Adelaide’. I was surprised at that. We have had a considerable increase in the number of MRI machines in Australia. According to the Auditor-General, we have had an increase of about $50 million in the costs of MRI benefits over what was anticipated in the budget a couple of years ago, yet we still have not got them in the places where they are most needed-public hospitals like the Women’s and Children’s and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in South Australia where an MRI machine is in a position to do the highest valued work that it will probably do and provide the most benefit to the community. Instead, we have them in radiological practices all over the country and they are probably doing lower valued work. I have had a look at the Blandford report and I found that it did not recommend putting an MRI machine in the Women’s and Children’s Hospital. I have had a look at the annual report of the minister’s own department, which has some discussion on this matter and points out that there are particular difficulties in relation to the provision of MRI services for children because it requires more sensitive care in relation to anaesthetics. This was confirmed to me by the staff at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital, who said that when they send a patient to the Royal Adelaide to have an MRI scan they have to send a team of anaesthetists with them. They are away for several hours, which obviously disrupts the rest of the workload at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital. I am greatly concerned by this absence. I have raised it with the state health minister, Dean Brown, and he seemed to be fairly oblivious to the problem. He was aware that the Women’s and Children’s Hospital or the health commission had put out a tender for one of the private MRI machines to be bought into the hospital, one that had benefits attached to it under the arrangements. What he was not aware of was that, despite cabinet having made that brilliant decision, when the tenders were called there was absolutely no interest. So there has been no progress. The state government does not appear to have a plan to correct the situation. I have people in my electorate who are extremely concerned about the issue, including a young lad named James Bodin who was the best friend of the child who was ill. He ‘was’ the best friend, because the child, Lachlan Wasley, died about three weeks later. He had an inoperable, malignant tumour on his brainstem and died within a week of surgery. It is a very emotional issue. There are an awful lot of parents around South Australia who are deeply concerned about it. James Bodin has been out there running an absolutely wonderful campaign. He has raised more than $10,000 for childhood cancer research and it has been put into a fund in the name of Lachlan Wasley, his best friend who died and brought this matter to my attention. the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, in particular a leaked copy of the Productivity Commission’s work in progress report into international pharmaceutical price differences, which showed that complaints by the pharmaceutical industry that the Australian pricing system for new drugs is too tough are largely unfounded. The purpose of the study was to compare prices",215,Representatives Main Committee

461,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (6.23 P.m.),"I will speak briefly regarding a matter that relates toWednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28243 that manufacturers received for pharmaceutical products in Australia under the PBS with those obtained in countries with similar and dissimilar arrangements. It was commissioned by the Commonwealth government and arose out of discussions with the pharmaceutical industry working group. There were seven comparison countries selected: the US, Canada, the UK, France, Spain, Sweden and New Zealand, with France, Spain, Sweden and New Zealand considered to be similar to Australia. The preliminary results show that manufacturer prices in Australia for the top 150 pharmaceuticals are much lower than those in the US, Canada, the UK and Sweden, but manufacturer prices in Australia are closer to those in France and about the same as prices in Spain and New Zealand. However, it also made some points about the types and classes of drugs within that. For example, prices paid by the Australian government for truly innovative drugs-new chemical entities-are similar and in some cases higher than in comparable countries. The greatest price discrepancy is in this area of me-too drugs-that is, newer drugs that are more expensive but have similar therapeutic outcomes to older and cheaper drugs, where Australia pays less than comparable countries. The highest prices paid for pharmaceuticals are in countries where there are no real government controls on pricing, such as the US, where prices are almost double that paid in Australia. I believe this shows that under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme companies are awarded for true innovation and that prices for drugs that show little benefit over existing medications reflect their real rather than marketing benefits. It also shows the sort of cost-effectiveness controls established under the Hawke Labor government in 1998, which ensured that the high prices paid by consumers in the US are not being afflicted on the Australian taxpayer. The report, I believe, proves once and for all that, if the government sticks to the PBS pricing process and stops interfering at the behest of industry, the industry will be rewarded for real innovation and Australians will be rewarded by having a manageable scheme that provides effective and safe medicines to all at affordable prices. Dr WOOLDRIDGE (Casey-Minister for Health and Aged Care) (6.26 p.m.)-The member for Kingston raised a serious concern. I will attempt to give him a serious reply. One of the difficult things about being minister for health is that, even for someone who might be medically qualified such as me, it is hard to form a view about technology. It is hard to form a view on highly technical matters. Similarly, the PBS, which I will come to in a second, is another highly technical matter. What you tend to do is take the view of experts. This is proper. You set up expert committees. You try and get a range of views and then you try and force an expert committee to come to a consensus and give you a view. There will always be another expert who has a different view. We have seen it recently with the listing of the pharmaceutical Zyban and a researcher in Sydney getting a lot of publicity for taking one point of view yet the balance of opinion on my expert committee was to the contrary. The whole MRI process has been debated at very great length. But I guess, given the way it played out and given the behaviour of some in the area, the capacity for me to do anything other than take expert advice is very limited. I set up an expert committee under Professor Blandford. At no time did I seek to influence the outcome of that committee’s deliberations. I asked them what their expert view would be on the further extension of this new technology. We have substantially increased it in the last five years, even if some of it was by accident rather than design. Off the top of my head, I think you are looking at around $3 million per machine. The demand is limitless, so the only way you can try and put some cost control on it is to put some controls around the supply. 28244 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 South Australia has three machines. Had the expert committee said to me, ‘Every children’s hospital in Australia needs one of these,’ I would have done everything I could to have implemented that. But that is not what the expert advice was. Again, unfortunately, in health care you find professionals who will use the public or use a particularly compelling case to try and argue for their own personal benefit. I am sure every radiological department in Australia would like one of these, but they are not going to get it unless the Commonwealth is prepared to chip another $100 million or so into radiologists’ incomes. I am not sure that is the best use of public money. In the specific case of South Australia, there are three funded machines. I accept completely what the honourable member says, that it necessitates a trip from time to time from one hospital to another to get a funded scan. I think that is probably a lot cheaper than putting a whole lot of extra machines in. I am sorry to hear the story the honourable member tells about his constituent child dying of cancer. It is an enormously traumatic thing. It does sound, in this case, given that he died three weeks later, it would have made very little difference one way or the other. I would be very roundly criticised by the opposition were I to act other than in accordance with the way my experts have advised me. SoI am damned if I do, and damned if I do not. I sleep okay at night because I know that I have not attempted to influence a committee. I have asked for the advice of experts and this is what they have given me. It is always open another time for another committee to come back. On the issue of the state hospitals, of course it is open to a state government at any point in time to put a machine into its own hospital. It does not need Commonwealth authority or approval. There are a few spare machines going cheap around Australia if a state government wished to do that. I do not mean to single out South Australia because all the states behave similarly in this-they would rather blame the Commonwealth-but they could have a machine in a week in that hospital if they saw that as being the highest priority in the state for their health care. On the honourable member for Bruce’s comments about the PBS, I agree with that study. Of course, he can point to no single occasion in the 5½ years I have been minister of my having sought to interfere with, or alter the outcome of, expert committees’ deliberations. he is still here. It will be a bit disjointed because it is about one issue but it is off a range of points. I am not asking for any action at this time, but I think it is an issue that he will recall. It is currently in the news and therefore it is worthy of some further consideration. I suspect the minister will remember that in something like September 1999 there was an issue regarding, the month before, a 15-year-old boy in Melton in Melbourne collapsing after drinking an alcoholic food essence. The minister came to parliament on that day with a bottle of the essence and announced several degrees of action which he was taking. One was to write to the ATO to ensure that these essences were actually reviewed in terms of the excise duty paid, so that they would actually pay the excise duty of full alcoholic drinks rather than be treated as a food. He referred the matter to ANZFA regarding the labelling of such products to ensure that there was a better labelling regime put into place. I think he also wrote to state and territory governments alerting them to the issue and seeking to ensure that such products were put into the licensed areas of premises in order to minimise the opportunity for minors to actually access such material. At the time. I commended the minister for his action, although I did raise a question several weeks later about the fact that I thought the matter should have gone a bit further because of the concern I had that I had gone to the same supermarket several weeks later and the material",216,Representatives Main Committee
462,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (6.31 P.m.),"I will just raise one other issue with the minister whileWednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28245 was still in the open area of the supermarket. I fully understand that that is an issue for the Territory with respect to that. Frankly, the way I got it removed was actually raising it again a week later with the management of the supermarket and saying that, if they did not remove it, I would be calling the police. I would just like to update the minister on some aspects of this. He may or may not be aware that the actual inquest into the young lad’s death is currently under way in Melbourne, and there has been a range of issues considered and covered in the media over the last couple of days about what has actually occurred. For example, although the minister’s expectationand I must admit it was also mine-was that the change in excise duty would in fact lead to a situation where the alcohol essences that we were talking about were largely withering and dying on the vine, there appears to be significant anecdotal evidence that they are still out there. Partially I think that is a situation of old stock still being sold. The action that was taken was not going to take that into account, and I understand that. There are also some issues being raised about the question of duty being avoided on imports rather than product produced in Australia. That appears to be a problem with Customs, which has also been raised recently and could partly explain why some of those sorts of essences are still available. I would certainly urge him to comment-and I may well make some public comment myself in the next few days-about the fact that the labelling issue perhaps needs to be looked at again. I have some concerns about the decision taken by the ministerial council in this area and I would ask him to acquaint himself with that, because ANZFA made some recommendations to the ministerial council, which, with some reason but probably not sufficient reason, adjusted that decision. There is also the question of whether further action should be taken to remove these products from state and territory locations all up. The minister, at the time. I raised that aspect of the issue, made the point that that is a state and territory power and responsibility. I raised the point at the time, though, that I believe there may well be, under the Trade Practices Act, a capacity to act federally. I am not saying necessarily that that is the most appropriate way to do things, but I do think that we probably ought to have another look at the incidence of this product. Obviously there is an inquest going on, so I think we also need to look at what comes out of that inquest. I do think that there are some issues there and I certainly offer our support to look at what might be done. I think we would both agree that these particular essences ought not to be available publicly, in my view not even in licensed premises. I made some inquiries at the time at some 10 or 15 stores in the area that I represent and spoke to people about it. Essentially what was said was that two types of people were getting it: people who appeared to be buying it for minors and people who were pretty much derros. For those reasons I think these essences should be banned. (Time expired) Dr WOOLDRIDGE (Casey-Minister for Health and Aged Care) (6.36 p.m.)-It is truly a question without notice and I am without my question time brief pack, but I will do my best to answer. I do recollect the case and I have noticed some of the publicity in the papers in recent days. I gave several undertakings at the time and they have been carried out. The first is that we have reduced the size available. The honourable member is correct. Two or three years ago you could get 500-millilitre bottles of black sambuca essence, and I am not quite sure why one would want that. One of my staff told me the other night that she actually bought a bottle and tried to make some rumballs and she could not understand why anyone would bother to buy it to eat either. Today you are limited to 50-millilitre bottles, or 100-millilitre bottles in the case of vanilla essence. The Australian Taxation Office has changed the taxation treatment of this and it is now taxed as any other form of alcohol. That removes the price incentive to buy such a prod28246 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 uct. ANZFA has adopted the labelling. That took a while but it is now in place. I noticed-I cannot remember whether it was today or yesterday-that the Age newspaper did a survey of a number of stores in Melbourne and found that in fact there was no old stock. It is possible that there is some old stock in other parts of the country, but I was heartened to find that they could not locate any. We do have a food ministers meeting coming up in a couple of weeks that I will be chairing. I would be happy to give the honourable member an undertaking to raise it with state and territory ministers, because they are the ones that are very easily able to deal with a consumer recall like this-because that is effectively what we are talking about. On the issue of duty on imports, that question would have to be directed to the minister for customs. I am afraid I have no knowledge of that. Ms HALL (Shortland) (6.38 p.m.)-Whilst the minister is here, I will raise one issue and then go on to some other issues that I want to raise. Maybe he could just take on board what I am saying and consider it a little later. In the area that I come from-the Central Coast, the southern part of Newcastle-there is a chronic doctor shortage. It is an area where there is quite an elderly population. In fact it is the 16th oldest area in Australia, according to the ABS figures taken at the last census. What is happening there is that elderly people are having to wait between seven and 14 days to get a routine appointment with their local GP, particularly in the Central Coast area of the electorate. Some submissions have been sent to the department, and they have been rejected without even being considered, because of the classification of the area. It is classified as a RAMA 1 area. Those submissions have been sponsored by the local council and by the GPs in the area. They have the support of the Central Coast urban division of general practice and of the local pharmacist. They have my support as well, of course, as well as that of the local state member. To refuse to look at a submission just because of a classification and to refuse to allow some overseas doctors into the area-which is what we are hoping will be allowed-is a restrictive method of assessment. Minister, if you could look into that, I would be grateful. I will now move on to the other part of my contribution. The other thing that is a problem in the area that I come from is the shortage of GPs who bulk-bill. I was really disappointed that there was no move in the budget to encourage GPs to bulk-bill. We have a situation where we have an elderly population and a large number of people who are dependent on some sort of Centrelink assistance living in the area. The simple fact that they are unable to access a general practitioner who bulk-bills creates enormous hardship for them. When you add that to the fact that there are no local Medicare offices and people have to travel long distances, it is easy to see that the lack of a bulk-billing GP really does create problems for these people, especially those in the Central Coast section of the electorate where there is only a private transport provider. Therefore, I feel that the government really needs to act and to demonstrate a greater commitment to Medicare than just lipservice. The real commitment comes from ensuring that the pensioners in my electorate-and in every electorate, for that matter-can access bulk-billing. I find it very disturbing that we are seeing so much money being put into advertising which is directed towards the private health industry, while in my electorate I have a chronic shortage of doctors and many people who are missing out on being able to access bulk-billing. I would quickly like to move on to the issue of aged care. I am pleased to see that the minister is here. I want to hark back once again to the point I just made: the Shortland electorate is the 16th oldest electorate in the whole of the country. It is the 16th oldest electorate in the whole of Australia, and there is a problem with a shortage of beds in that area. I know that, if you look at the Hunter, it can be said that there are sufficient nursing home beds there, alWednesday, 20 June 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 28247 though there is a chronic shortage of hostel beds for people living in the Hunter, and the figures bear that out. If you look at the Central Coast, you find once again that there is a real shortage of beds within that area. You also have to understand that area to see that, even if you look at Lake Macquarie, which falls within the boundaries of Shortland and Charlton, for an elderly person to be given a bed in a nursing home on the western side of Lake Macquarie(Extension of time granted) I will quickly conclude by saying that this is an issue that needs to be looked at urgently. I feel that beds need to be allocated fairly and evenly throughout the electorate. I would also like to express my concern about the fact that the beds that are being allocated within the area are being allocated more to private providers than to the community sector. I feel that the minister needs to take seriously some of the concerns that were raised with her when she met with providers in Gosford recently. They understand the area, and they understand the issues, and they were really disappointed that their concerns were not taken seriously. couple of things to say about the last speaker’s comments. First, I was very pleased to meet with providers in Gosford fairly recently and to get some very positive information for them. I do think they felt that their concerns were certainly being listened to. With regard to some of the points that were raised by the last speaker, I would like to make the point that in 1998 when the Auditor-General did a review of aged care he found that the previous Labor government had left a deficit of 10,000 places. He found that this was systemic, that it had occurred over a number of years and that, in order for the situation to be remedied, there was a need to inject an additional 10,100 places, in addition to providing for growth in numbers. I have followed the Auditor-General’s report, and in the time that I have been minister I have issued 32,000 places, counting the 9,500 places for the year 2001. With regard to beds, the Auditor-General also found that, in order for those to come on stream, it takes something between two and 2½ years for infrastructure to be made ready for the beds to go into but that it is necessary to release the beds so that the providers can then build the infrastructure knowing that their funding is guaranteed. The problem was that through the 1990s the Labor Party failed to release the beds, thus failing to get the process of building infrastructure to begin. We are having to deal with this as it was inherited. We can fix it prospectively but not retrospectively. Releasing those new beds means that the places are guaranteed, and they will bring them on as quickly as they can. With regard to the Central Coast, that area does need attention paid to it. The initial announcement was about how many beds were being released, and it showed that that was just over 9,500 for the year. With the allocation that will be advertised very shortly, the coming advertisements will show which areas are to be targeted. So that you understand the way in which the department recommends to me which areas should be the targeted areas, I will explain the process. Each state has a committee called an ACPAC, which is an aged care planning advisory committee. Each of those committees meets and considers the ABS figures, with five-year projections. Each committee considers the special needs groups, which are listed under the legislation. Each committee considers special issues and special pleadings that may come to them. Each committee then makes a recommendation to the department which then makes a recommendation to me. I would very much expect the Central Coast to be on that list, because the figures clearly show that it falls behind the ratio we strive for of having 100 places per population of 1,000 people aged 70 and above. That ratio was set by the Labor Party, but they never met it. Indeed, from 1986, they ran it down. We have actually allocated enough places to meet that benchmark, but they are now having to come on stream. As soon as the infrastructure is built",218,Representatives Main Committee
463,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (Mackellar,"Minister for Aged Care) (6.44 p.m.)-I have a28248 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 and a bed is ready, the money flows automatically. That is why I say that, once the beds are released, they are guaranteed. That is the job we have had fixing up the legacy that was left to us, and we are doing it. As I said, the Auditor-General found that the legacy was that the previous Labor government had failed to issue 10,100 places. this government can be praised for taking a difficult area of policy and embarking on quite radical reforms, but I think perhaps it runs the risk of promising far more than is actually delivered, or at least of creating that impression in the aged sector. Therein lies the problem. PerhapsI have the germ of a solution. There are four nursing homes in the Lithgow district. They came to me recently to point out that they believed they had had an allocation of what the media were starting to call ‘phantom beds’ where they were given places but they did not have the resources to create the infrastructure. Having listened to that-and I think the minister would agree with me that I have been fairly constructive in my approach to the aged care dilemma over the past four or five years with the three ministers I have dealt with-there seemed to be a need to bring together all of the aged care providers in Lithgow, as an example, to discuss their particular difficulties, to see whether they could find common goals and whether there was a duplication of demand with the same people on each other’s lists. It turned out that there were people on more than one list. Having said that, one of the really worrying things as far as I was concerned was that with one of those providers-Tabulam Cottage at Portland-the community had been assessed as being able to self-fund the accommodation required for a number of awarded places when it was quite clear that it could not. The department recommended that it was vulnerable, yet when its application for capital funding was rejected it was told that it was because it had the capacity to raise funds, which the department admitted at the meeting the other day was quite incorrect. The very competent trio of departmental people sat and listened to each of those providers and then I joined them at the end of the day to work over those difficulties. So it looks like we will have to review the Tabulam Cottage situation. The other provider is Three Trees, a brand new-facility, which has been granted 12 places-I think it is. Three Trees has no history of capital raising. It is left with places and not much prospect, it believes, of raising funds when other providers in this not affluent area are trying to do the same thing. Despite the 100 per 1,000 formula for aged care places for those over 70, it seems to me that there is a substantial unmet demand across my electorate. Perhaps part of the answer is to run these interfaces between all providers and the department community by community. I know it sounds cumbersome. If the minister wants to speak to me later, the people from that department were, I think, very enthusiastic about the model as a way of working through the problem. They identified perhaps some over demand and duplication and some people who could get together to share facilities and resources. It might be something as simple as laundry and it might be something like looking at whether or not they can be converted into community care packages rather than going down the costly infrastructure route. I think a lot of this demand can be satisfied in a non-capital investing way and I certainly would like to see more of the sort of exercise that we organised last week in Lithgow to bring that aged care community together, to work for the common good of the communities, not for individual demands within the community group. I had Catholic and Masonic people who started these places and who, historically, have not talked to one another about aged care delivery now doing so. That is some progress, I can tell you. This model may be too cumbersome but I think it is the way to go. for some of those comments, because I found myself that, by bringing homes which are in a",221,Representatives Main Committee

Indeed, it is being done in certain areas across Australia. One of the things I noticed when I took over this portfolio was that it grew up as a cottage industry and that good management is very important, because good management gives good care. Regarding the comments on Portland, I will check with the department on their outcome. The capital stream that has been put in place-being the money that flows from bonds and the accommodation charge-is money that can be used for repaying loans which you can get from the bank. This is bankable. After all, this money is paid monthly in advance; it is a constant and guaranteed stream of money which is very bankable, to use those terms. Many homes are taking this up and, in good management terms, are able to fund the infrastructure for the new beds and the recurrent stream that flows from that. I have been concerned that in parts of rural Australia there are some management problems, yet when I visit the home in Yeoval, which is run by the community, I see that the work they have achieved and the outcomes they get are just tremendous. It is a multipurpose service with acute beds as well as aged care beds, and the way it is managed by the community can be held up for a lot of other people to follow and copy. There is provision for conversion to community aged care packages. They can apply under the round-and the 2001 round will be advertised, I expect, within a couple of weeks-to convert places to community aged care packages. Allowing people to remain at home, where they really want to be, is a very strong part of the policy that I am pushing, developing and administering. The member for Calare said that there is often the same name on many lists for different homes, and this is perfectly true. I was told by somebody who actually is close to the industry that a family had met together and decided they would put their mother in a home, so they put the mother’s name down for 12 separate homes. The only problem was that, when the mother’s name came up, the mother said, ‘I’m not going into any home. I’m staying in my home.’ That became a statistic. The thing that has been very important to me in the last few months, and which I am promoting very hard, is the Commonwealth Carelink Centres. These centres provide information about the range of services we provide which enable people to remain at home. Up until now, this information was so hard to find. If you suddenly found that you needed services to help you bathe and dress in the morning, to help with the shopping and all those sorts of things that you need to remain independent, how would you find it? By ringing Commonwealth Carelink-1800 052 222-people can now find out where those services are. I hear from my 32 partners around the country who manage those Carelink Centres that the most plaintive plea is from people who ring and say, ‘They want to put me in a home. What services have you got that will keep me in my home?’ That is why community aged care packages are so well regarded and sought after. There were 4,000 of them when we came to government; we now have 24,000. With regard to the people who might want to look at that option, there is the provision to apply in the round when they are applying for whatever it is they might decide to do.

I ask the minister to, instead of having a knee-jerk reaction WR RQHUHFRPPHQGDWLRQ ZKLFKLQFLGHQWDOO\ ,VWDQGE\ ORRNDWDOOWKH UHFRPPHQGDWLRQV² the other 19 made in that report. As everyone is saying, no-one is wanting to send signals or green lights to people smugglers, but the system is not working and that is the hard, cold reality. The world is facing a new reality today of people’s movements. There are people moving for all sorts of reasons around the world, through ethnic cleansing, through fear of persecution, through actual persecution and through wars and upheavals. Some, God forbid, are even looking for a better economic future. Call them what you will-boat people, illegal immigrants or asylum seekers-they will continue to come to this country. But always bear in mind that the number of people who come to this country is minuscule compared with the number of people arriving in many other parts of the world. How we are dealing with that is an absolute disgrace. We are out of tune with expectations and realities. This country has a good record, built up over many years of dealing with refugees and resettlement, but we are tarnishing that record before the international community today. Other countries are dealing with much greater numbers of people. They are dealing with them in a more humane way and they are not having the riots. I have seen the film of the riots in Port Hedland so many times and yet no-one ever asked what caused that riot. Of all the media reports, there has never been a report from a detainee there. We only have the minister’s view. We only have the departmental views or the views of the thugs who run these centres. Most of the people who run these centres are ex-prison officers. I have spoken to them, and most of them come from a prison or corrective service background. They bring that whole custom into that society, and you wonder why there are riots in there. Go and spend a day in Woomera, Curtin, Port Hedland, Maribyrnong or Villawood and think about if you were there for eight, nine, 10, 12 months or two or three years whether you would not riot after a while, too. These people are stressed for all sorts of reasons. I know that the guards and everyone else have to be protected, but we are going about it totally the wrong way. It always amazes me that there have been so few riots; I would have expected that there would have been many more riots there. Now that the minister has joined us, I say this: there will be many more riots in those centres. There will be many more people coming there, and we are dealing with it in a completely inappropriate way. IfI see those photographs of those weapons again! When I went round the detention centres the only weapons I was shown were a few bits of wood in Curtin. I ask: who found those weapons and where were they from? It is too convenient for the same people-the minister and the people who run those centres-to always appear on the television after a disturbance and that same photograph of those same weapons always appears.

Well, that is fair enough: history will show who was naive, whether it is me or the minister. But I say with the greatest possible respect to the minister: we are dealing with it in an inappropriate way. We are just building up. It is going to happen time and time again until we change the policy as it affects these people. Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (7.06 p.m.)-I wanted to agree with the comments the member for Throsby has made in relation to detention centres. Unfortunately I do not have time tonight to go through the comments I had on detention centres, because there is another matter that I want to address. It relates to the treatment of people who are HIV positive who apply to come to Australia in the interdependency category. I am pleased that the minister is here, because I know that this issue has been raised with him by a number of my constituents. I want to refer to a letter that was written to me. Obviously I will not use the constituent’s name. He wrote to me on 27 February 1999: I met the man I will spend the rest of my life with. We are a defacto couple, very much in love and sure of our future together. My correspondent’s partner is a Canadian physician who is working in Sydney as a doctor. The man himself is also in the health care profession. Both of them are employed currently. Both of them have been contributing to the tax system. Both of them are keen volunteer workers. They are members of their local tennis club and go to yoga regularly. They are people who are contributing to the Australian economy and making a contribution as well to society. Let us call my correspondent’s partner ‘D’. He writes that D and he: completed all of the requirements set out so that he may become a permanent resident of Australia including a medical whereby he declared his HIV status. According to information that we have received from our case officer at DIMA, and an immigration lawyer working on our behalf, it is likely that our application forD’sPermanent Residency will be rejected on the basis of his HIV status. We have been advised that the current government considers that applicants with HIV pose an undue burden of cost on the Australian health care system. I want to point out that neither of us has ever been symptomatic of HIV illness, nor ever hospitalised because of this diagnosis. We are both on anti-retroviral medications that are working well to keep us both healthy. In factDhas an undetectable viral load and his T cell count has only improved since moving to Australia. The key point is that when DIMA make an assessment of how much someone who has the HIV virus is likely to cost the Australian community, they are working on figures that I presume were developed in the 1980s when HIV inevitably progressed reasonably quickly to full-blown AIDS. Of course that is not the fact at all these days, with the more sophisticated drug treatments on the market. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs assume a cost of about $239,000 over an unspecified but shortened lifespan for someone who has HIV. I have spoken to a number of specialists in this area, and their figure for drug treatments is $11,000 to $12,000 a year. The point I make is that both of these men are employed. They are in the work force. They are paying much more than $12,000 a year in tax, I am sure, and they are making a very important contribution to the community. There are also noneconomic factors that must be taken into consideration when we are making decisions about whether people’s interdependency visa applications should be agreed to. This couple own a home together. They have shown a great commitment to one another and are accepted by one another’s families as their life partners. This brings me to another matter when it comes to carers for people who become ill. Many people who are HIV positive do not have blood relatives who are willing to come to Australia 28252 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 20 June 2001 to take care of them. DIMA has to consider that the definition of ‘family’ should also include people who have shown a genuine long-term commitment and, if they are prepared to come to Australia to care for an Australian citizen who is sick with AIDS, that that should be something the Australian community applauds rather than discourages on the basis that they are not a blood relative but are, in fact, just someone who is in a relationship with someone who is sick. I am pleased that the minister is here because these are two areas where perhaps the thinking of his department is somewhat out of step with new treatments in the area of HIV and AIDS and out of step with the general community. ister for Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (7.11 p.m.)-I do not want to exclude other members, but others will speak no doubt on the same matters that the member for Throsby raised. Essentially the health criteria have to be addressed in three contexts. The first is whether or not somebody has a disease which is contagious. AIDS is not contagious in that sense, if people manage their contacts appropriately. The second matter is the extent to which people’s requirement for services might prejudice the needs of the Australian community. There are certain areas in which we have limited facilities and resources and in which, if you take people with a particular condition, it could prejudice the extent to which an Australian might be able to access those services. The third is the ongoing and potential cost. The assurance I would give the honourable member is that, in relation to HIV status, people are not automatically excluded. The costs are looked at very closely because there have to be briefs prepared, many of which come to me for a judgment as to whether or not the circumstances are so compelling that there should be a waiver. In the interdependency cases, the sorts of factors that you have mentioned are taken into account. We do take into account the nature of the relationship. We do take into account the extent to which people have resources to be able to assist the particular individual and we weigh those factors against the potential cost. I have not sought to draw attention to these matters, but the fact is that, even with amounts of the order of $1 million or so, grants have been made where it is seen to be compelling. One of the things I have been concerned about is that people might see me as being unduly soft in relation to these matters. lished in some Senate estimates that I had acceded to something like 41 out of 43 applications that had come in for a health waiver. I am glad to hear that I have not been unduly soft in relation to those matters. I would say to the honourable member that there is not an automatic bar to people who have HIV. In relation to whether we should establish for people who have certain medical conditions a wider group of carers than a close relative-which is really what you are asking-you would have to look at the implications of that for migration generally. Are you establishing a category of entry which the very creative profession of which I am a part-the legal professionwould find to be another gateway to providing access to a wider group of people? Generally speaking, I would say in circumstances like that that it would be best to push an application to see whether or not the circumstances are such that a minister would exercise discretion in the particular case. first opportunity I have had in this chamber to speak on a report on visits to immigration detention centres.

Ask me, because I wanted them published. I did not want to have in camera hearings. I wanted them on the public record. If you think the hard yards have not been done then let us release the transcripts. I am surprised that Alan Ferguson can be accused of being anything other than a loyal defender of your government. It is true that on three days we sat to discuss what we had seen, what we had heard and what were appropriate recommendations. Minister, I did not get every recommendation up that I wanted. I believe the biggest problem with detention centres is the lack of scrutiny. In our own state, Minister, we have an inspector-general of prisons who can do inquiries at the direction of a minister, who can do his own motion inquiries and who can hear complaints; and the Ombudsman’s role is not interfered with. You have that additional protection. We have an official visitors procedure. I would have liked to have seen an official visitors person for each detention centre. We did not follow that model, but we followed an independent one-one that you have so much disparaged. I believe that it is in all of our interests that we lift the lid on detention centres. Minister, you ask what message we are sending through the proposals that we offered. You are piloting a familythrough the chair. for families. We supported that. I wanted to go further, but the committee members said that you were taking action. I endorsed that, but you will note that the report said that the condition and treatment of families was a critical priority for the committee. We proposed that a target be set-and I can see that you have done a lot to reduce the processing time-of no longer than your current funded processing time. But we linked another recommendation to it that you have conveniently ignored: sponsorship, so that, yes, people can be released provided they are sponsored by an appropriate organisation. If they do not have a security clearance, if they are not sponsored, they are not let out of detention centres. Why has there been so much dissembling on this issue? Why won’t you give that a try, Minister? You ask what message softer treatment of people in detention centres sends back. What is the message, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the minister sends back by having 58,000 overstayers in this country? It is not bringing the country to its knees, Minister. In the year 2000, there were 2,800 people who arrived by boats and who were held in detention centres. What was it in the Netherlands? It was 50,000. In France it was 75,000. It was nearly 100,000 in the UK. Good luck to you. We have a minuscule problem compared to other countries. I congratulate you on that. But why can’t you and your departmental officials get it into perspective? Why do you deceive the Australian people so much? I only have 50 seconds left. This is a good report. It was honestly arrived at by men and women of goodwill from all political parties. It deserved consideration. I can understand when a report or its recommendations are not agreed to by governments. But what was most hurtful was the government’s attack on coalition members and the fact that the report did not receive careful consideration. I know that we should act according to conventions, but the strongest imperative here is Australian standards-the Australian sense of a fair go about what is right and what is wrong. I have confidence in the Australian people in the long term.

Let us just mention one fact. Not only is the policy, and its implementation, quite wrong at the moment but we are spending more than $100 million in these detention centres. To achieve what? It is supposedly to send a message back to people that Australia is not a soft touch and that people will be treated in a certain way in relation to refugee status if they come in a boat-or if they are desperate enough to end up having to come in a boat. This is one of the biggest wastages of public money in social policy that we have had for a long, long time. The minister well knows that more than 90 per cent of the Afghans and more than 90 per cent of the Iraqis will be or have been accepted as genuine refugees. Notwithstanding this, we have had people in detention-and they have not merely been in detention. In talking to the people in Port Hedland and in Hakea Prison, I was stunned to hear that about 50 per cent of those who were allegedly accused of various incidents in relation to the 11 May event had been in the notorious isolation cell in Port Hedland prison-or Port Hedland Detention Centre. I used the word ‘prison’ but it is worse than a prison. The conditions in Hakea Prison are much better than the conditions in Port Hedland Detention Centre, there is no doubt about that. What did this isolation policy mean? It meant that people could be in this isolation centre for seven or eight months-and, in the case of one man, 16 months-before they had their first interview. I do not know who authorised this policy. I cannot believe that the minister authorised the policy that people would have to wait for seven months before they even had an interview-never mind how long they had to wait before there was a judgment about whether or not they were going to be given refugee status. That was before the first interview. We know from the parliamentary committee and from what we have been told by othersincluding what I was told-about the conditions of the especially notorious Juliet Block. I was not able to see Juliet Block and nor was the parliamentary committee. There is a very good reason for that: it is a total disgrace. It would in fact be condemnatory in international terms-not only the physical conditions but also other conditions, including not being able to contact their own wives and children for more than seven months. That is your policy, Minister. You may not be aware of all this. I think that you are not aware of this. I think you have been misled. You have been told lies. I am sorry to say that you have been told lies by officers and by people in the ACM who are trying to cover up. I was shocked at the atmosphere in Port Hedland; you could cut it with a knife. And the tensions and hostility between the two groups, the detainees on the one hand-and I am talking about all the detainees, not just the trouble makers-and the ACM people on the other hand, were really unbelievable to me. But has the minister really understood this? Is he really interested in resolving this? Is this the heritage that you want to go on with, Minister?

I have not dismissed all of the recommendations-I make that very clear-and I will look positively at those. I make the further point and it is relevant to what the member for Calwell and the member for Throsby have had to say: I am not about having an inhumane policy of detention-it has to be humane. There are certain expectations and people do have entitlements to complain to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission-and they are advised that they do. They do have an opportunity to complain to the Ombudsman. I believe that there should be an independent monitoring of what was happening, and that was the reason I set up the detention advisory group, which included two former ministers-John Hodges and Gerry Hand. It has included a number of the members of the Refugee Resettlement Advisory Council: Mr Paris Aristotle, who deals with torture and trauma issues; Professor Harry Minas, who is a leading psychiatrist; and Major-General Warren Glenny. The status of those people is beyond doubt. You raised the issue of sponsorship. My concern about what is happening here is not in relation to finding refugees-I think we do find refugees. The member for Calwell talks about Afghanis. The real problem is that we have probably been finding many who are not refugees to be refugees. If you look at what the Afghani community is saying at the moment about the extent to which Pakistanis are part of the caseload, I think we still have a major problem in relation to those matters. A lot of people have come who have relatives in Australia, and I suspect that many of them are looking for family reunion outcomes. They would find sponsors. If you are going to bring people who are looking for family reunion outcomes and link them with their sponsors and have them in the Australian community, if what they are looking for is migration outcomes, then they have achieved it. That is one of the concerns that I have about those sorts of suggestions. I cannot comment on everything, save to say in relation to the member for Throsby’s comments about the people who are misbehaving that, in general, that occurs because they have reached the end of the road; they are being held for removal and there is a certain amount of desperation. I understand that. They are more difficult to manage and I appreciate that, but I do not think any degree of amenity is going to alter that possibility or probability. I will conclude by saying that I will ensure, as I have before, that the honourable member’s questions on notice are properly and quickly dealt with.

I think then you get a better understanding of where the committee was coming from. Dr THEOPHANOUS (Calwell) (7.31 p.m.)-I just want to notify the chamber that I am writing privately to the minister about some concerns which I think have to be dealt with in relation to my visit to Port Hedland. I want those matters to be looked at. The other issue is: when will the minister actually formally reply to the committee, as distinct from the media response? ister for Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (7.32 p.m.)-There is a requirement to respond within three months. It will be a whole of government response, and I will do that as quickly as I can. It will get a normal and full response, and it will not be dismissive of those recommendations that can be sensibly and easily implemented. I just make that point clear. I thank the honourable member for Chifley for his suggestion that I read recommendations 10 and 12 together. I was conscious of both of those recommendations, but I did not read them as being dependent upon each other. Let me say to the member for Calwell that, when people are endeavouring I think to use the opportunity to win an argument in relation to the detention system, they want to see the demise of it, and they are putting us under duress in relation to those matters. That is how I see it. If there are serious allegations about inappropriate behaviour, they should be properly and fully investigated and we should have a situation where we can establish what the facts are. I do not like dealing with allegations that are made in the media which are not always clear and precise as to who they apply to and which are not capable of immediate and appropriate response and investigation. If the member receives serious allegations and he wants to put them to me, I will ensure that they are fully and properly investigated; I will ensure that happens. I think it is a far preferableDr Theophanous interjectingpreferable way of dealing with these issues. Let me just say to the honourable member that, when I facilitate a visit in good faith to enable you to hear what people have to say and when I explore with you how we might follow up those issues later by a proper investigation of any allegations that might be put to you, I do not expect, particularly when I am away, as I was",229,Representatives Main Committee

If we are going to facilitate visits, which I am more than happy to do, I have an expectation that, if you receive complaints, you will enable them to be dealt with properly and fully.

The honourable member for Calwell will resume hisThe following answers to questions were circulated: China: Bear Farming (Question No. 2535) Does the Australian Government have a position in respect of the Chinese Bear Farming Industry and in particular to bear bile and associated products; if so, (1) what is that position. (2) has he, or will he make any communication with the Chinese Government in respect to bear farming and the trade in bear bile and bear bile products. (1) The Australian Government views with concern the issue of cruelty of animals and concerns about reports of ill-treatment of bears in the Chinese Bear Farming industry, in particular reports concerning the ill-treatment of the endangered Asiatic black bear. Under the Commonwealth Wildlife Protection (Regulations of Exports and Imports) Act 1982, the import of Asiatic black bear products, including bile, is not permitted unless they are taken under a captive breeding program registered under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). There are currently no bear farming operations in China registered under CITES. (2) Australia has made representations to the Chinese authorities under CITES about traditional medicines containing prohibited products, including those of endangered bears, and will continue to do so. Separately, the Australian Government has strengthened legislation governing the trade in products derived from endangered species to make it easier to prosecute infringements of the legislation. It has also conducted a targeted public education campaign to promote awareness of wildlife conservation issues in order to reduce the demand for traditional medicines containing products of endangered species and to promote more appropriate farming practices. Foreign Affairs and Trade, Department: Representation in Ramallah (Question No. 2564) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 22 May 2001: (1) What is the cost of the building of an Australian Representative Office in Ramallah, in the areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority. (2) When and who made the decision to build such an office. (3) What is the size of the Palestinian economy, in terms of GDP per annum, that this office will service. (4) What is the size of the Israeli economy in terms of GDP per annum. (5) How many Australian embassies or consulates have been opened or closed since 1996. (6) What was the size, in terms of GDP per annum, of the economies served by Australian diplomatic missions that have closed since 1996. (7) How does the Australian Government justify the cost of operation and construction, as well as future expansion of the Australian diplomatic presence in Ramallah, compared to the missions that have been closed. (1) The office is a leased floor of a seven storey commercial building in Ramallah. The lease commenced on 29 September 2001 for a period of 5 years. Rent is A$48,580 pa. The office fitout, including furniture and fittings, is scheduled for completion in October 2001 and has been budgeted at A$450,000.

They focus on maximising Australia’s economic and political standing to influence regional and global developments to advance Australia’s national interests, and take into account various strands of external policy, including foreign, trade, defence, immigration, and development co-operation considerations. Other factors may include the expansion of commercial contacts to help generate inward and outward investment, and the need for consular and passport services to Australians travelling and living overseas and to their families in Australia. Considerations of efficiency are relevant, both in terms of comparative costs in different locations and configurations, and in maximising our investment in the existing network. In relation specifically to Ramallah, the decision was taken following the Prime Minister’s visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories in April 2000. I regret that the honourable member does not support the opening of this Post in contrast to the views of the Member of Kingsford Smith.",232,Questions On Notice
