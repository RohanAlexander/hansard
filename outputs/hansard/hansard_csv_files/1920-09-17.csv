0,"House Of Representatives. Friday, 17 September, 19s0. Took The Chair At 11 A.m., And Read Prayers. That Sir Thomas Ewing, Who Was Long A Member Of This Parliament, Died Yester","day. He held office as Vice-President of the Executive Council and also as Minister for Defence, in two of Mr Deakin's Administrations, and many of us knew him intimately. I had the honour of knowing him for many years as a member of the Parliament of Kew South Wales, and he was also a member of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth. His sunny nature and amiable disposition endeared him to all. I think we might say with safety that he bad no enemies in politics. Although his circumstances were such that a life of leisure would have been more compatible with his disposition, he devoted himself with assiduity to politics, but his health suffered so seriously that he was compelled at length to retire. I desire to express my deep regret, as well as that of my colleagues and the Parliament generally, and to extend to the deceased gentleman's ' relations our ' sincere sympathy. morning when I learned that Sir Thomas Ewing had passed away. He was a member of this Parliament for something like, ten years, and we all. esteemed him for his genial nature. He had absolutely no personal enemies in this Parliament. While he did not spare his political opponents, his criticisms were always bright and breezy, and devoid of that sting whioh, unfortunately, is associated with much of our parliamentary dissertations. With the Prime Minister, I believe that his work as a member of this Parliament tended to shorten .his life. I am very sorry to hear of his death, which is another addition to tbe gaps that are steadily being made in the ranks of those of us who were members of the first Commonwealth Parliament. On behalf of the Opposition, which I have the honour to lead, I desire to extend to the deceased gentleman's relatives the most sincere sympathy in their sad bereavement. expressions of regret to those which have fallen from.the lips of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I was one of tbose who had the pleasure of knowing Sir Thomas Ewing personally, and as a member of this House. He was a member of the House of Representatives during the stirring days of the first eight",19,Setup

If so, will the right honourable tives and friends the most sincere symgentleman state whether the assertion is pathy. to endorse what has been said by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Leader of the Country party. The late Sir Thomas Ewing was an old colleague of mine. I knew him well; he was loved and respected by all. The better he was known the more he was liked. He was a loyal comrade and always ""played the game."" regret I have is that all too often we do not discover these good qualities in our fellows until after they have passed away. I hope that we shall endeavour to do so while they live, and try to recognise the good qualities of honourable members, no matter in what part of the House they may sit. "" Tom"" Ewing possessed the most amiable disposition, and I feel his death deeply. I warmly endorse the kindly remarks that have been made concerning him, and which will be conveyed to his friends. son) -As a tribute of respect to the introduced during the present session,'I memory of our old colleague, I invite desire to ask him whether he has given honourable members to rise in their places any consideration to the request of a deand remain standing for a few moments.

I learn for the first time, and with some surprise, that the Soviet Government is in a position to pay any salary to its officers in this country. One Speaking quite seriously, the statement is grossly inaccurate. The Government has not seized the salary referred to, and it is entirely ignorant of the circumstances of the Soviet representative. It has not seized his correspondence, and is not treating him differently from any other citizen. So far as I know, the facts are that he is treated .exactly the same as any other citizen of the Commonwealth.

Australian Aero Club, the Australian Jockey Club, Sydney, and the Avro Oompany at Mascot, I wish to bring under the notice of the Assistant Minister for Defence the disgracefully low flying which took place over Randwick a few days ago, when machines, I understand, were dropping leaflets from so low an altitude that all the horses in the boxes were terrified, and the people on the racecourse rushed for shelter. derstand, that the honourable gentleman is President of the Air Board, and I ask whether these facts have been brought under his notice. something be done, pending the passing of the Air Regulations, to stop this low flying, which, undoubtedly, before long will produce a great tragedy in one of our capital cities? see that the practice is immediately stopped. As soon as the A i r Council is definitely formed, regulations will , be 1 issued to prevent anything of. the sort. ister come to a decision as to the action to be taken by the Government to carry out the wish expressed, by the Conference held last week in regard to the export of sheep-skins? The men in the fellmongering trade are still out of employment. . I understand that the Prime 'Minister promised to bring in legislation dealing with the export of sheep-skins, and I desire to know Avhether that legislation will be introduced at an early date. the course proposed by the Conference necessitates legislation. I desire, however, to make a statement for the information of the House, and to invite the criticism of all who are concerned in this matpersonal explanation. ter. On Friday last a Conference, consisting of representatives of every section delivered by myself in Geelong in which of the wool industry-growers , brokers, tanners, wool scourers and fellmongers, exporters, wool-top manufacturers, spinners and employee!'-wa s held. question to be considered was the position ereated by the scarcity of skins,, added to the fact that many hundreds of men are now unemployed. The matter before the Conference was how to overcome that difculty of unemployment. It was decided, I think by thirty-two votes to eight, to recommend a scheme of this kind, namely, that all skins should pass through certain prescribed channels before being exported, and that the localbuyer should have an opportunity of purchasing at the world's price before the skins were exported. Now, that is the practice already-so we were.told-in the case of nine-tenths of the skins. As a matter of fact, there, was some difference of opinion I unupon this precise point, that is, as to whether the quantity comprised nine-tenths or seven-tenths. However, the local buyer does have a chancet now, and' Cannot it was decided, in order to°encourage the industry,, to give him the right, to secure all his requirements at the world's price. That sounds a perfectly fair proposition. The Conference was called to advise the Government. I bring this matter before I shall the House now. I ought to have done so before, but failed, since the matter had escaped my attention. I invite honourable members to offer any criticism's and objection's which they may see fit to present, either on Tuesday or Wednesday next at the latest, so that the sense of Parliament may be gathered in regard to 1 the question. Honourable members will be able to gain precise accounts of the proposalsfrom the press of Saturday last, and from the hamoiable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett), the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister), and the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley), who were present at the Conference.

16,Mr Hughes,"I desire to make aleague the Postmaster-General( Mr ask the Ministeri f he will endeavour to Wise), I desire to correct them. I am at a loss to know how the report could have appeared in such shape. It statesHe had been speaking to the Postmaster General about telephonic communication; he did not like those people who came to him inquired into. I think it probable that and said that things could not be done. Anythe agricultural experimental stations one could say that the Government did not pay a man £1,000 or £2,000 a year to say things under the control of the various State like that. (Laughter.) What men were paid Governments will have taken up . the for was to say how to do the impossible. When subject. the Postmaster-General said it was .impossible to get wireless telephones and ordinary telephone wire in this country, he (' Mr Hughes) said, "" Go along and get them."" The result was that the Postinaster-IGeneral told him that afternoon that he was getting them. That report is like the curate's egg-it is good in parts. But I continued at some length to speak about experts. I was talking about experts-peopl e who come along and tell us that a thing cannot be done. As any one who 'has had experience of experts must know, they can be absolutely maddening; they can drive one to the verge of despair when telling one that a thing cannot be done. I said that I did not want people like that. My office boy could tell me that things cannot be done. I said I wanted a man who would say, "" Yes, this cannot be done, but I will tell you how to do it, and see that it is done."" This newspaper, no doubt, has been misled by some careless telegraphist in the Postmaster-General's Department. I am quite sure that the reporter would not have made such a mistake, and the idea that the editor or his staff has made it is, of course, absurd. Somehow ox other, however, the mistake has occurred, and I want to say most emphatically that it is one to which I take very serious exception, and to which my colleague, the Postmaster-General, also takes serious exception. I take this first opportunity to say that I was referring to the experts; and if those gentlemen have any ground of complaint concerning what I said I will deal with them in due course. KEW VARIE TY OF SEED WHEAT. for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) follow up the courtesy which he showed to me some time ago in obtaining information concerning the wonderful variety of seed wheat known as Yeoman, which gives up to 96 bushels per acre? I obtain a supply of this variety from the Imperial Government for the use of the wheat-growing States of Australia. to make a personal explanation upon the subject of Canberra. In this morning's Age it is stated, in the course of a report, that, when the Treasurer (' Sir Joseph Cook) was speaking, the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) made the interjection"" It will be another twenty years before it is finished."" then reported as having said, also hy way of interjectiona most unusual thing for me to do, as honourable members know"" it will be fif ty years before we sit there."" t Mr FO'WLEB -Well, what is wrong with that? say the wish was father to the thought in the case of the Age; and I want to point out, by the way, that this is not a report appearing in the Queanbeyan Age, but in the Melbourne Age. WhatI said was that it would not be fifty weeks before we sat there; and I may add that that is still my opinion. I do not know whether I will be in order in concluding by saying that, if this House does its duty, I will prove to have been a true prophet. planation, and in justice to the honortin Chapman), and also to the reporter for the Age, I desire to say that I waf sitting immediately behind the honourable member yesterday evening, and that it was I who made the interjection to the effect that it would be fifty years before we got to Canberra.",21,Personal Explanation

24,Able Member For Eden,"Monaro( Mr Ausgard to the statement of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) that he was considering the question of payment for next season's wheat, I ask if he will specially consider the case of New South Wales, which has just recovered from two years' drought; and will he see if the whole of the 5s. guarantee can be given to the farmers of that State, who have had very great responsibilites thrown upon their shoulders as a result of the drought ? considering the whole matter, and I would not like to forestall their conclusion. Honourable members are aware that we are likely to get a bumper harvest; possibly, indeed, a record crop. There are 37-J bushels to the ton, and it is probable that which, as I said before, is quite beyond there will be somewhere between 2,500,000 tons and 3,000,000 tons harvested. If honourable members care to multiply 37-J bushels by 5s., and to multiply that answer by 2,000,000 or 3,000,000-whic h .performance is beyond me-the y will realize that the amount of money involved will be quite considerable. My colleague, the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook), who has scarcely recovered from his endeavour to grapple with the serious financial position of the Commonwealth, will tell the House that it is no light thing to find £7,000,000 or £10,000,000 next January, for that is the least which we shall have to find during that mouth. However, we shall do what we can. I fully realize the position of the New South Wales farmers. The Government have considered that phase of the whole situation, and I will say that if anything can be done to give them special consideration it will be done. volved will be more than £30,000,000. will see what a thing it is to be a peripatetic ready reckoner. I could not do these things'. All the same, I think that the right honourable gentleman is wrong. is over-estimating it . to give the New South Wales farmers special consideration will be done. Prime Minister for information, following up a question having to do with the salaries, bonuses, and promotions of officers and employees of Parliament. Upon the occasion of my originally putting the matter before him, the Prime Minister courteously announced his sympathy with my purpose. I may tell him, however,' that I have been unable to obtain the information which I needed in reference to the Senate. Now that the Budget is before the House, I ask if honourable members should not be entitled to the information such as I have suggested, and in regard to the collection of which the Prime Minister was good enough to say that he supported me. my scope, and which rests with Mr Speaker and the President of the Senate. I supported the request of the honourable inember for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney), and I again support his endeavour to secure the required particulars.

I have always been in favour of the bi cameral system, but my tolerance has its limits. I-can assure the honourable member that tliere is no fear of a dissolution of this House, and that if the honourable gentlemen in another place continue as they are doing, I do not see why we should not submit the questions at issue direct to the people. NUMERA LS ONHANSAED that the forms of the House will not permit me to give notice of the question which I desire to ask, I must request Mr Speaker to be courteous enough to furnish me with an answer to it-without notice. My question is as follows:-Will Mr Speaker have the numbering of the bound volumes of Hansard printed in Arabic numerals, which are far more simple than Latin numerals, as can be seen, for in stance, when we compare 88 with cian throughout. It seems to me that we should follow the example of the State Parliaments, and make use of the more up-to-date and scientific Arabic system of numbering our Hansard volumes. Johnson) -The system of numbering volumes of Hansard has been in existence from the beginning of this Parliament, but as the Hansard reports are not confined to this branch of the Legislature, the matter to which the honourable'member refers would naturally have to be referred also to Mr President. PerI n view of the fact sonally, I think there is a good deal to be said in favour of the honourable member's contention, and the method of numbering, suggested by him, is used in connection with the House of Commons debates. A t the same time. I can see one advantage to honourable members in our system, because an honourable member who is anxious to make an embarrassing quotation from another honourable member's speech, perhaps long since forgotten, and recorded in a bound volume of Hansard, may occasionally be restrained from doing so by a contemplation of the formithere"" dable numerals of which the honourable member has just given as an example. < offended the Treasurer yesterday afternoon by interjecting when he was delivering his Budget. I would like to ask him what he thinks of the leading articles in this morning's newspapers, particularly that in the Age, criticising his Budget? sue the task of reading the whole of that criticism.

Chevassu, formerly on the foreign editorial staff of the London Times, who has made Imperial politics his study, is familiar with all the proceedings of the Peace Conference and the League of Nations, and an accomplished linguist. hardly point out to honourable members the importance to Australia of the League of Nations. now is in a state of flux, and the League of Nations, by its advice and by its power, can exercise a potent influence on our destinies. know, the mandates have not been officially issued, and many questions relating to our quota of defence, to the means by which the world's peace shall be maintained, and disease, labour troubles, and other matters dealt with the world over, are in the hands of this, the only international body that has, as it were, the sanction of law behind it. This League, of course, has yet to prove itself competent to deal with all the great questions that are intrusted to it, but its influence already is considerable. Australia is a signatory to the Covenant, and, perhaps, has more to lose than any other na-' tion from the deliberations of the Conference. Many of the things for which our , soldiers fought have not yet, as it were, crystallized and assumed so definite a shape as to preclude the possibility of such alterations as would be fatal to our interests. I do not know any man who is more competent to represent the Commonwealth at this great world gathering than my friend and colleague, Senator Millen. He will go to this Conference with a clear understanding that he represents this Parliament and this country on those questions. On certain of the questions to which I have alluded in a general way there is no room for difference of opinion. We cannot have any difference of opinion -w e cannot listen to any one who speaks about any encroachment on the principle of a White Australia. Senator Millen, who holds the Australian view, recognises that fact clearly. There are other mattors on the agenda paper 'which leave any amount of room for difference of opinion, and as to these, of course, Senator Millen will exercise his own discretion. Mr Hughes. honourable gentleman will leave Australia towards the end of this month. How long the sittings at Geneva will continue Senator Milleni t is impossible to say, but at their conclusion Senator Millen will proceed to London in order to deal with matters of great public importance, which, unhappily, have not been dealt with owing to the resignation of the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt). SenatorI need Millen will take up the questions of finance where that honourable member dropped them. He will deal with quesThe whole world tions of trade and trade organizations, and will also make such recommendations and effect such alterations in the organization of the High Commissioner's office as are As honourable members considered desirable. Of course, I am expressing my opinion as a private member-bu t other honourable members have been to England during the last two years and are able to judge for themselveswhen I say that there are far too few Australians in Australia House-fa r too few. I think it is essential, if we are to have an Australia House which really represents Australia, to have the staff continually refreshed by new drafts of blood from Australia. These men, after serving at Australia House for a period, will return to Australia and others take their places, in this way maintaining touch with Australia. if we adopted the same principle in the Customs Department. missioner be an Australian, pursuant to that policy? I do not think we could get a man to go to England to take up the duties of High Commissioner, and to come back just as a public servant does to Tesume his place in the Public Service. When a gentleman goes to Australia House as High Commissioner he has divested himself of his political opportunities in order to take up the position, and when he returns he divests himself of that office and all that the office means. There must be some continuity of policy, and, to that end, discretion must be exercised; but, subject to that, the principle I have laid down is, I think, a sound one. I come now to another matter with which Senator Millen will also have to The deal. I have spoken in this place several",26,League Of Nations Representatio N At Geneva Conference Common Wealt Hfinanceandtrade Aus Tralia House Immigration

They believe in immigration, and every man who loves Australia knows it to be [196] essential for the country's development and defence. The success of this scheme depends upon, not only obtaining the right kind of men, but transporting them to this country, and dealing with them efficiently when they arrive. That in itself will require a very effective organization on this side. To both these phases not. Charlie of the question the Government propose len, during the period he will be in England, will do what he can to give effect to this movement, and we hope that as a result of this policy there will be a large influx of desirable settlers to Australia.

Hughes) was going to make a statement on this subject this morning, and was temporarily absent from the chamber when he rose. I realize that the representation of Australia at the Geneva Conference is absolutely essential. We must be represented there. honourable gentleman has said that there can he no question of party so far as the policy of a White Australia is concerned, and that honourable members on all sides of the House are pledged to that policy. I sincerely hope that Senator Millen will .voiqe the emphatic opinion of Australia as a whole upon, that question, and will' insist that there must beno departure from that policy^ which was practiea'lly laid down by this Parliament as far back as. 19.02. representative of both sides of the House. with that phase of the question.

The responsibility rests with the Government. I certainly protest against Mr Barnes being' sent to England in this capacity. I am personally friendly with him, but he is as bitterly opposed politically to me as is anyhonorable member opposite. cannot be said that he will be able to fitly represent Australia. There are Australians who know asmuch about Australia as do any of our citizens whocome from overseas. vilege as an Australian, to work in both England, and the. United States of America; but because I had worked in England for four years, could it be said that I was qualified to represent England in Australia, and to put forward here I think not. Many Australians who have been connected with the Immigration Departments of the Various States might fitly represent the Commonwealth as immigration agents in the Old Country. Having regard to the ' enormous The. right shortage of houses in all our capital cities, it will behove the Government to go slow in the matter of immigration. Indiscussing the War Serviee Homes Bill yesterday,. I mentioned that returned soldiers had had their homes sold over their heads, and that they and their uniforms and belongings had been, thrown into the street. In such circumstances, it is imperative that Australia should proceed slowly in the matterof immigration. I protest against the selection of Mr Barnes for the position of Immigration* Agent, since I believe that there are thousands of Australians who could better fill the position. WAR SE'RVIGE HMS.

Those who have had anything to do with 'the settlement of -our boys on -the land in New South Wales -know that the money we have advanced for this purpose to the State Government has not resulted in anything like the adequate settlement of our men. The cost per head has been tremendous. I propose to give a few illustrations of the position in New South Wales. On one occasion I was requested by a couple of returned soldiers to inspect some soldier settlement blocks -in a certain district. I have -a knowledge of the coastal country, and I do not hesitate to say that the officers who were responsible for the scheme to put returned soldiers on that piece' of land ought not -to rem'aim in 'office for another five -minutes.

We are constantly boasting of what we ""are doing with resDect to tihe settlement of returned soldiers on the land, but in .my .judgment there has been [196]-S ' It would be no real attempt in New .South Wales to settle returned soldiers on the Hand in tbe way intended by this Parliament ""when We agreed that advances for that purpose should be made to the -State Governments.

However, I do regard it as the duty of this House to seo that justice is done. The War .Service Homes Commissioner, wbo had .been given authority to construct so many thousands of houses, had to consider how best lie eould go about building them. He found that under the system of buying timber from dHy to day or week to week prioes were constantly jumping up against him. I h one instance, where he made an arrangement with millers to receive a rebate of 5 per cent,., the price of the timber had been raised by 10 per cent, within a month. As a matter of fact, tLe increase in the price of timber is largely due to the fact that royalty payable to -the Queensland Goverument for timber standing iu the scrub bas been increased to 20s. or more per 100 foot. Queensland Government are not to 'blunie, but they submit the blocks for -competition, with a fixed minimum royalty of, say, 5s. per 100 feet, and if the' people who are competing, lo' secure -the blocks are willing to run the upset price up to 20s. per 100 feet, of course they can do so. at present?

He acted wisely, therefore, in purchasing these saw-mills, always provided that be got them a't a fair price. The only method of ascertaining whether the price paid was fair is by seeing who reported upon the value of the timber as it stood in the bush, and upon the machinery in the mills, and who checked the reports thus received, and by finding out if they were competent to present a fair report. In the first place the Commissioner approached the Queensland forestry Department, and secured thi; servicesof 'their best man, who valued the timber, and made -certain recommendations. Then the Commissioner obtained a man or men to place a value on tlie machinery in the mills and tlie plant. Afterwards consideration was given to The the effect of having two mills working alongside one another on adjacent blocks. It was evidently decided that more ecouomical work could be done by two mills working . htrge blocks of timber country side by side and using the one management than could be achieved by establishing two widely separated nulla with different controls.

The only question is whether i5s. was a fair price to pay, without taking into consideration the value of the land. I have yet to be told that the other expert reports were not satisfactory. there is a suppressed document, which warned the Government against accepting a certain valuation .that was, however, accepted. for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) may deny that. stand, what the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) says is not correct; there was no such letter sent to the Commissioner or the Minister.

I regret that the Queensland Government have not been more sympathetic towards' our returned soldiers. .West Sydney( Mr Ryan), who has been Premier of Queensland, will agree with me that there is no State in the Commonwealth that has such good dairying and Agricultural land unalienated within easy access of seaports, or with better, railway facilities, than Queensland. There is no land in Australia that can be acquired at a cheaper price; but when it comes to the question of tenure the Queensland Government are opposed to freehold .and offer perpetual leaseholdare better known to the honourable member than they are to me. Returned soldiers desire to acquire land on a freehold basis, and if it were made available in' that way, tens of thousand's of soldiers would have been prepared to settle, there, and not only develop the country, but build up the population. . There is another matter which I would like the Minister to take into consideration. Many.of our returned soldiers, .desirous of starting in business, have ex-, perienced considerable difficulty in open-., ing accounts with wholesale firms. Under the present system it is impossible, without considerable delay and risk, for the wholesale merchants to ascertain whether the applicants for .credit have any liabilities, because their encumbrances with the Department are not published in the ordinary way, and, although in many instances the merchants are desirous of helping the soldiers as much as possible, they are not prepared to do so because of lie risk involved. It may be said that by paying a fee of Is. or so a necessary search could be made, but the merchants have not the .time to inquire in other States to ascertain to what extent an applicant may be involved from time to time. Quite recently the following case was reported in White's Mercantile Gazette, which is circulated amongst the commercial communityA certain returned soldier got a loan over certain chattel assets; he left the Colony, and the Department took possession under its bill of sale and sold him up. The whole proceeds of the auction sale did not nearly cover the ' advance. The man was made insolvent by the trade creditors, and some outside assets realized. The Department now claims the whole proceeds of these, and leaves the creditors absolutely nothing. It should be remembered The honourable member i(h that trade gazettes can bo prosecuted criminally if they publish the security token in such cases. The Department claimed tbe whole proceeds, wbich left the other creditors absolutely nothing. The procedure was tested in the Courts, and held to be legal. tecting the soldiers. pleading for.

D. Millen) must ""have gained of difficulties arising from .the operation of the principal Act. I approve of most of the amendments of the. original measure embodied in this Bill. Much has been said by speakers who have preceded me concerning proposals made to extend the scope of the-original measure so as to include war workers'and members of the Young Men's Christian Association amongst those entitled to the benefits of the Act. I wish to eay at once that I object to the scope of tbe Act being extended in. that way, and I amdisposed, to vote against the provisions of this Bill which are intended to have that effect. worthy of oonsideration? to the extension of the scope'of the Aet as proposed is very similar te. that already given by previous speakers. I believe it will cause a great deal of discondifferent view of it from that expressed tent amongst members of the Salvation Army and war workers of various kinds other than those specially mentioned' in this Bill, who will believe-that they have just as much right to be included amongst those entitled to the -benefits of repatriation generally, and to the War Service'' Homes Act, as are those w,ho are especially mentioned-. have got on without munitions? depreciate the work done by munition workers, members of the Young Men's Christian Association, or any other persons who can -claim fo have done war. work; but I do eay that the soldier should been quite obvious up tb the present that we cannot provide the number'of houses that are required for the soldiers.. Until sucb time as. we come within measurable distance of being able to meet the requirements of the soldiers, I will not agree to the extension to war workers, members of the Young Men's Christian Association, or the Salvation' Army, and similar bodies of the benefits of the War Service Homes Aet. The soldier must be OUT first consideration, and in the circumstances I object to specialize particular war workers in the way proposed in this Bill, and so I feel myself obliged to oppose that proposal.. member ""says definitely that he will vote against that provision of the Bill, will he n'ot make the reservation that he will wait to hear the Ministerial statement as to the persons already included amongst' those entitled to the. benefits'of the Aet? than that of courtesy to the Honorary Minister( Mr Rodgers), I shall be pre=pared to do that.

188,Mr Bell,"If for no other Teasonon the--subject"" ,on the motion for the adjournment of the House on Friday last, and also from that expressed by the bonorable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), who dealt with the matter last evening. As to the merits of the deal, I wiU say nothing, because I know nothing about it. I think that statement applies to the average member of the House, if not to practically every member of it. It has been Claimed that the War should not have entered into a deal of this sort without the matter having first been brought before Parliament for its sanction, but it has been quite evident to me that this Parliament definitely gave -the War Service Homes Commissioner and. the Minister for Eepatriation that .power when it passed the original War Service HomesB ill . , If we cannot depend on the War Service Homes Commissioner and the experts to whom he can look for advice to say whether it is good or bad business to purchase timber for War Service Homes in the way he has done, then, in my view, this House is not in a position to express a valuable -opinion on such a matter. It is about tbe worse. possible body that could be suggested to decide whether such a proposal is a good or bad deal. The chief objection which has been raised to the purchase is that the timber, in the long run, will not be as cheap, and consequently the opst of the homes, to the soldiers will be greater than, it would be if timber were purchased from private companies as required. Time only can tell whether this deal is a good or a bad one. On the subject of parliamentary control of expenditure and the contention that such proposals should receive the sanction of Parliament before we are committed to expenditure to give effect to them, I . take the view that this Parliament has the right to decide, first of all, whether homes -shall be -built for returned soldiers, and then whether the carrying out of the work shall be left to a' Commissioner, or body of Commissioners, or to the Minister.'foT Eepatriation and his Department. We certainly did give the War Serviee Homes Commissioner under the original Act the -power to spend millions of money in building waT service homes, and it is, therefore, absurd for honourable members to say now that we did not give him the 1 power to purchase timber to the-value of £500,000. shiploads of timber without any protest from members of this House. tion that Parliament is not a fit body to decide whether such a deal is a good one or not, I may mention that the honourable and I , though wo are representatives from the same State, hold widely different views as to the success or otherwise of sueh a deal. On Friday morning laBt, the honorablo member for Franklin, in referring to this matter, said, that he knew of no case where a large company had been successful in the saw-milling business, and that only men in business in a small way have been successful in carrying on that industry. My experience has been exactly the reverse. I have known companies carrying on the saw-milling business in a large way to be very successful, and I have known of a great many failures amongst small companies and men carrying on the business in a small way. Many men have f allied very quickly for the simple reason that they have not commanded sufficient capi. tal to hold timber long enough, OT to keep stocks necessary to enable the timber t'o be properly seasoned. My experience has been that in tbe timber industry men strong financially bave a better chance of success than can be expected by two or .three individuals who have little or no capital at their backs. I mention this difference of opinion between the honourable member for Franklin and myself in support of my contention that Parliament is, perhaps, tbe last body that should be. appealed to to decide such a question. Though the State we come from is not a very large one, and probably similar conditions apply from one end of it to . the other, yet we differ, so widely on this subject that we might debate it for . a week. Another matter which has been alluded to, and upon which I feel very strongly, has to do with the position of limbless and blinded soldiers. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) last night quoted from a circular issued by;",43,Poynton^

198,Mr Bell,"I "" am pleased with thatelude these youths from the benefits of repatriation-whatever ' reasons or excuses may be advanced by officials; and, if by chance there have been such cases as honourable members have alluded to, the wrong must be righted immediately. I have just one note of criticism to offer regarding the building of Wa r Service Homes, and I regret to have to do so, because the Minister for Eepatriation (SenatorE . D . Millen) and the Commissioner have done excellent work. has been .demonstrated in the houses which have been built in the suburbs of Melbourne and elsewhere. On the whole, a very good type of .house has been erecteda type suited to the particular locality, and, no doubt, to the requirements of the individual occupants. But I have to complain that similar progress has not been made in country towns, and in certain parts of other States. From my own electorate, applications had been forwarded before my return to Australia twelve months ago, but nothing has yet been done. When General Birdwood was in Tasmania, he laid the foundation stone of one house, but nothing further has been done. who have been waiting have been so disgusted with the delay that they have gone elsewhere, to private sources, in order to secure homes for themselves. Absolutely no progress has been made in the smaller towns in my electorate, although applications have been in for a very long time. In reply to an inquiry which I sent to the secretary of the Returned Soldiers League at Wynyard, as to whether any progress had been made, I received a letter stating that absolutely nothing had been done. The writer added that the building of War Service Homesi n his district was a farce or a tragedy, according to the point of view from which one looked at it . The country districts should be given some of the benefits arising out of the building of these homes, and the soldier who lives there should at least have a share. In many cases at present he has nothing. built in the cities, where there are far too many houses already. If houses were built outside, where there is ample work for young men to do, it would be very much better. Houses are being built every day and every week to the number of hundreds in the year in the cities, but the soldier who lives in the country district has not received the same benefits. I trust the Minister will take some notice of any protest on this matter, because it is the oue point in regard to the War Service Homes scheme with which I am distinctly dissatisfied. ney-Assistant Minister for Defence) [3.37] I wish to put honourable members on both sides of the House right regarding one point which has been stressed, particularly by the honourable member for That Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) and the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell). I refer to the statement that boys, under age, who went overseas are deprived of the privileges of returned soldiers. 1 assure honourable members that no boy, no matter how young he was, who went into the firing line, and did his h it there, will be penalized for so doing. war gratuities as well?

I aim, however, definitely assured by the Ministerf o r Defence (Senator Pearce), and by my officers in the Department, that it was conclusively shown that on several occasions-and it is presumed that there were many more instances-ther e was collusion between the parents and certain boys under age to enable them to go overseas. Of course, all these boys made false attestations, but that will be forgiven to those who went into the firing line.. Still there were others who, with the connivance of their parents, designedly made false attestations, knowing they were under age, and got over to the other side, and after they had had a good trip , which cost them nothing, their parents put in a protest, and claimed that the boys should be sent back.
