Thursday, 9 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14371 Thursday, 9 March 2000 ----Mandatory Sentencing tencing has had on Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. We know the majority of offenders who are caught are Aboriginal and committed their offence in a remote Aboriginal community. We know that Aboriginal people make up 73 per cent of the Northern Territory’s prison population. We know that, since 1996-97 and the introduction of mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory, juvenile detentions have risen by a staggering 145 per cent. We have all heard the sad case of the 15-year-old Aboriginal boy who committed suicide after being detained in a Darwin detention facility for stealing textas. But there is another aspect of the Northern Territory’s laws that I was certainly not aware of and I wonder how many other members of this respected chamber are similarly uninformed. A staggering 68 per cent of those caught by mandatory sentencing do not speak English as their first language. Indeed, of the 27 per cent of the Northern Territory population who are Aboriginal, some 75 per cent have very poor or limited understanding of English-a figure which rises to 90 per cent in remote communities. This would be fine if there were adequate interpreting services provided by the Commonwealth or by the Northern Territory government. But there are not. The Northern Territory provides no such services for Aboriginal speakers and despite the fact that a 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week Commonwealth translating and interpreting service provides services of translations in 150 languages, including Latin, not one Aboriginal language is covered. Perhaps honourable members on the other side need a translation of that fact. Not only do mainly Aboriginal people get caught up in mandatory sentencing laws more often because they do not understand the laws in the first place but once they have committed the offence they have no access to interpreting services to help them through a legal system which provides no judicial discretion anyway. I am sorry, but I cannot agree with the Prime Minister that that is simply a matter of states rights. The consequence of the lack of any interpreting services extends beyond just the legal sphere. It is also impacting on the medical field, where there have been reports of Aboriginal women being sterilised without their consent. The failure to provide a translation service is completely inexplicable, given the number of reports and recommendations to government over the last 20 years, including from human rights bodies. These are breaches of Australian state and federal antidiscrimination laws and international human rights laws, in my view. I understand that Northern Australian Aboriginal legal services have made numerous representations to Minister Ruddock on this issue. It has been the simple response, ‘It is a state issue.’ Mr Deputy Speaker, that is code for ‘This government has no interest in pursuing the issue.’ This is not a state issue. If the Commonwealth agrees that it is a Commonwealth responsibility to provide a free interpreting service in 150 other languages, then I fail to see how adding Aboriginal languages is less of a Commonwealth responsibility. I urge the minister to rectify this problem immediately. Young Achievers Mr ST CLAIR (New England)-I rise today to congratulate a group of notable and energetic young achievers. In the last three weeks, I have had the pleasure of being invited to events where I was able to meet and listen to a number of young leaders from my electorate of New England.

I would like to recognise in this place a number of these young people from around New England for their wonderful achievements. First, two weeks ago, I had the pleasure of being a judge for the Armidale Miss Showgirl competition. As a judge, I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the participants in the contest, Tarley Brennan, Diana Brazel, Jane Archibald and the winner, Angie Tully. Angie will now go on to represent the Armidale Show Society at the zone final in Dorrigo. From there, two girls will be chosen to represent this area in the final of the Miss Showgirl competition of New South Wales at the Sydney Royal Easter Show. I would like to wish all the girls the best for the future and the best of luck to Angie for the zone finals in Dorrigo. Last Saturday, I was yet again another judge-this time for the Kootingal and District Lions Club Youth of the Year Quest finals. Congratulations to all the entrants, namely, Tom Donald, Sara Bryant, Amy Burrastone, Joel Cocking, Katie Law, Kate Biffin, Joanna Graham and organisers of this quest for making it such an enjoyable and successful event. While there can be only one winner of the zone final, namely Kate Biffin, all the young contestants were fantastic. The public speaking contest was won in great style by Sara Bryant. I would also like to congratulate the Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development, LeeAnne Molony, who will be working as an economist in the National Economics University of Hanoi in Vietnam; and Alexandra Murray, who will be working as an agriculture instructor in the Kanduhulhudhoo Island Development Society in the Maldives. This is a wonderful achievement by two outstanding young Australians. I had the pleasure of meeting these two on Tuesday night in Parliament House at a reception hosted by our Foreign Minister, the Hon. Alexander Downer. Finally, Luke Adams, Fiona Lubett, Angus Priestley-Harker and Alexander Reese also receive my congratulations as school students representing New England attending the National Schools Constitutional Convention 2000, which is taking place in Canberra this week. In closing, I would like to make the point that young people are the future of our towns in regional and rural Australia. Often, you hear that young people are not excelling in our communities and are not achieving in the bush. This is not true. The above are prime examples of what the younger generation are doing in our rural communities to provide a strong future for country Australia. (No. 3) 1999 Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 December 1999, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That the bill be now read a second time. Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999 provides for the scheduling under the act of three parcels of land associated with the Warumungu and Frewena land claims. It arises out of a negotiated settlement between the Central Land Council, acting on behalf of the traditional owners, and the Northern Territory government and pastoralists. The Warumungu land claim has been described by the Central Land Council as one of the longest and most bitterly fought land claims in the history of the land rights act. The claim, to an area east of Tennant Creek, was first launched in November 1978, but the claim did not come before the Land Commissioner until 1985 due to a number of legal attempts to block it. The then Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Mr Justice Maurice, recommended in 1988 a grant",107,Representatives Main Committee
231,Mr Melham (Banks) (10.00 A.m.),"The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory)of fee simple to most of the area covered by the land claim. A significant part of this land has been returned to its traditional owners since then. Part of the recommendation included land that contained a stock route and a travelling stock reserve used by the adjoining pastoral interests. Negotiations continued over this part of the recommendation until a land swap was agreed upon. In return for giving up their claim to the stock route, the traditional owners received land of better configuration for their needs. It is the land subject to this land swap that will be scheduled under the act in this bill, along with the Frewena land claim, which lies adjacent to the south. As a result of these negotiations, only one part of the original Warumungu claim has yet to be dealt with-that part involving the Brumchilly pastoral lease. If and when this is resolved, the Warumungu claim will finally be settled over 20 years after its initiation. When Mr Justice Maurice delivered his report, as required by the act, to the minister in July 1988 he included a short history of the Warumungu, pieced together from his investigation. It is worthwhile putting on the record in this parliament what Justice Maurice said about the Warumungu in that report. I will read from Report No. 31, which was tabled in Canberra in 1988, at page vii of the foreword: One has only to read the accounts and view the photographs and drawings of Spencer and Gillen to realise that in 1901 the Warumungu were a flourishing nation in the ordinary sense: a large number of people of mainly common descent, language and history, inhabiting a territory bounded by defined limits and forming a society under one government. They were once reputed to be the most numerous, most intelligent and physically the best tribe in Central Australia. Within a matter of years, the Warumungu had been almost completely dispossessed. They had fought vigorously to defend their inland state from the white invasion, but their spears and boomerangs were no match for the men on horseback carrying firearms. In 1962 the Commonwealth of Australia revoked the second, and last, of their token reserves: a worthless piece of land upon which no person could survive. When they made this claim in 1978, the Warumungu were landless. Astonishingly, perhaps, much of the Warumungu identity remains, and even today the sense of belonging to the land is a powerful influence in the lives of these people of the Barkly Region. The long and bitter fight by the Warumungu for their land claim is only one part of their story and only one of many stories in the history of the land rights act. But I believe it is one which emphasises the enduring spirit of Australia’s indigenous peoples. It is a story of struggle and pride, of a people overpowered by outsiders but who remained resilient in the nurturing of their identity and maintaining the connection with their traditional lands. It is also a story that clearly illustrates the fact that they were forcibly dispossessed of their lands. The Warumungu were certainly the custodians of a specific area of land with an organised form of government, a ‘flourishing nation’, in the words of the land commissioner. These are not my words but the words of the land commissioner who conducted a lengthy and thorough investigation into the claim-words which, in simple language, unequivocally designate the Warumungu as prior custodians of their traditional lands, words that many people in Australia, including the Prime Minister, do not seem willing to acknowledge. Stories such as that of the Warumungu clearly illustrate the longevity of indigenous history and culture, their pride in the land, the resilience of their spirit. The story of the Warumungu also illustrates the ongoing success of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. Several of the claims that have been scheduled under the act have resulted from negotiation. This negotiation has often been difficult and protracted, as in the case of the Warumungu claim, yet it is negotiation that has ended in resultsresults which indigenous Australians, pastoralists, miners and even the Northern Territory government have been able to live with. The land rights act is the most successful legislation 14374 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 March 2000 involving indigenous Australians in terms of these results. Once this bill has received royal assent, 64 parcels of land will have been returned to their traditional owners. This land has provided, and will continue to provide, its traditional owners with a sense of connection, a sense of pride, and a place where they can enrich and celebrate their culture in traditional ways. The involvement and support of indigenous Australians is the primary reason for the success of this legislation. Yet in the past few years we have seen an attempt by the Howard government to emasculate this most successful of acts. We have seen the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs commission an expensive and time consuming review of the act, the Reeves review, in an attempt to destroy the land councils set up under the act. The major problem the Howard government has with the land councils is that they have been too successful. For nearly a quarter of a century they have represented traditional owners in their land claims, vigorously advocated the rights of indigenous people, criticised government when criticism was due and struggled with successive obstructionist Northern Territory governments. The Reeves review was a vendetta against successful land councils that were only doing their job in representing their constituents, indigenous Australians. But so far the Reeves review has come to nothing, simply because its recommendations did not have the support of the indigenous people whose future it sought to tamper with. When I travelled the Northern Territory during the investigation of the Reeves review by this House’s Aboriginal committee, the opinion of indigenous people who would be primarily affected was loud and clear. Indigenous Australians did not want the land rights act, their act, amended without their support. So often in the past the white man had taken from them that which they had enjoyed for thousands of years. The land rights act has restored to traditional owners a small part of what they were dispossessed of. It is a message that should now be quite clear to the minister and his Prime Minister: leave the act alone. We on the Labor side have listened to the wishes of traditional owners, and we have a policy that reflects those wishes. Our national ALP platform clearly states: Labor reaffirms, as the basis for the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, the principles of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission (Woodward Report), which include: the rights of traditional owners in relation to access and development on their land; the protection of sacred and significant sites; and the existence of adequately resourced Land Councils with statutory responsibilities for the representation and protection of Aboriginal interests in relation to land. I have said time and again in this place that Labor adheres to the central belief that the land rights act should not be changed without the prior consent of indigenous Australians and particularly traditional owners. That is Labor’s commitment on this act. It would be a welcome outcome if the government gave a similar commitment, recognising the importance of this act to indigenous Australians. No longer would indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory have to be concerned that the white man in Canberra was wishing to bring down an act which they have successfully built up over 20 years. When the Fraser government in 1976 passed the land rights act, it received bipartisan support. It received bipartisan support in Unlocking the future: the report of the inquiry into the Reeves Review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. It would seem a simple commitment to reconciliation if the minister returned to a bipartisan approach on this act and ruled out any amendment of the act without the prior consent of indigenous Australians. I was part of that review. I note that the chairman, another member of the committee from the government side and also the honourable member for the Northern Territory are in the chamber today. We worked well as a committee in looking at the Reeves review. From a rocky beginning, we came together and achieved a consensus position in relation to our recommendations to the parliament. I commend all members of the committee, particularly the chair and coalition members. I saw a change in attitude-not that the members did not have a genuine position in the beginning-of the committee members. The members of the parliamentary committee worked constructively from a difficult position. It was our task to go and find out what indigenous people thought about it. We did not whitewash and divide on party political lines, or whatever, as often happens on parliamentary committees. I pay tribute to the chair in the way that he conducted that committee. He genuinely responded to concerns in the Northern Territory by indigenous people that it may have been another attempt to undermine what they regarded as a successful act. The prime recommendation, the one that we cannot move away from-and I think it has been consistent with the theme since this act was introduced in 1976 by the Fraser government-was the question of consent of indigenous people. Our number one recommendation, right at the beginning, was that the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 not be amended without traditional Aboriginal owners in the Northern Territory first understanding the nature and purpose of any amendments and as a group giving their consent. Any Aboriginal communities or groups that may have been affected were consulted and given adequate opportunity to express their views. That was the underlying theme in relation to our review. I commend the chair and coalition members and, indeed, the whole committee. We on this side do not say that the act cannot be improved, that we cannot learn from our experience of the last 20 years. What we say is that we must remove it from a party political fight. I believe the government would be well served if they took the lead from the parliamentary committee. The Prime Minister on election night said that he had a commitment in his second term of government to reconciliation. This is one way to send the signal loud and clear. I am disturbed about a couple of things. Today we are debating legislation that has consent across the parliament. That is the way it should be; it should be a cause for celebration. But it is a cause for disappointment in that it has taken so long for these indigenous people to get recognition in relation to their lands. WhatI am worried about is an article in today’s Australian headed ‘Push to Split Land Councils’ under the name of Richard McGregor, Chief Political Reporter, and Benjamin Haslem. It seems to indicate that there is a cabinet submission floating around in relation to the land rights act. If there is, I give the government clear warning now that, if they move away from what I think was a very constructive House of Representatives committee report that basically dealt with a difficult problem and go down the road of trying to impose amendments to the land rights act without the consent of Aboriginal people, they have a fight on their hands. My view is that it will be no credit to them. We on this side are prepared, in consultation with indigenous people-as we have done-to consider amendments on their merits. Frankly, the Northern Territory government-the old stealth trick-want to undermine the NLC and the CLC because they see them very much as their opposition in the Northern Territory. But if this government thinks that the Labor Party and other parties in this government will sit idly by when they go down that path, then they are in for another think. It is good to have members of the committee who were involved in the committee report in the chamber. I believe that what the chair and coalition members did on that House of Representatives committee was correct, courageous and the right thing to do. I know that they would take up the fight within their own party if their report was deviated 14376 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 March 2000 from. On this basis, if it is to mean anything to the workings of this parliament and the committee system, especially a committee system that goes out to the coalface in difficult times and achieves unanimous recommendations on a parliamentary committee, then I say to the executive, or those wanting to run another agenda, that you should listen to it. If you do not, then in my view you diminish the institution of parliament. We had a committee that honestly and earnestly went out into a situation where people were distressed. They saw themselves being investigated again by a white ‘politician’ committee and they felt under threat and under siege because people were again playing politics with their lives. It would have been easy for members of the coalition basically to produce a majority report and just run to a political agenda. They did not. The chair and other members of the committee deserve credit for that. Today is a cause for celebration, but the time for using Aboriginal people as a political weapon in the Northern Territory, Queensland or Western Australia is over. We will not cop that. We need to return to the days of cross-party support, and that is why I am happy to speak in positive terms about the legislation that this government brings into the parliament today, which are land handovers-causes for celebration. Just a signal that if the Prime Minister thinks he can tweak the opinion polls and shake public opinion and reengage with the bush at Aboriginal people’s expense-because we are getting an extra seat in the Northern Territory; Shane Stone did this. There is the underpinning of the original Reeves review-and it is relevant to this, because it is a complete contrast to what we are doing today. There is too much politics in the Northern Territory at the expense of all Territorians. When there are amendments to the land rights act, I want to be here supporting the government, as I am today with these handovers. I want to be able to say that the national parliament is going to have a positive approach to indigenous Australians for a positive future-working with them and not using them as political tools to try to win seats, by-elections or whatever. I commend this amendment bill to the House and say to the government-and I notice the minister representing the minister in the other place is here-that we will facilitate passage of this bill. These are the sorts of things that do not need long, dragged out debates. I have spoken a bit longer today, because I am disturbed by this newspaper article and the implications for all the good work done by the committee in settling down what was a volatile situation in the Northern Territory and for the assurances that were given by the chair and by other members of the committee that their views would be listened to and responded to in the halls of this place. This newspaper article today disturbs me. It means that all the good work that the chair and the committee did might have all been for naught because there might be a game being played in the oval office, in the corridors of power and in the executive. I am using this debate today to say that we will not shrink or walk away. I am sick and tired of Aboriginal people being used as a political tool in this country to go down the low road to seek to divide our community. I commend this bill to the House. I look forward to its speedy passage and proclamation and the return of these lands to their traditional owners. for Banks acknowledges the leniency of the chair in not calling him to order to speak only about the content of the bill-which he did do for the first two or three minutes.

233,Mr Wakelin (Grey) (10.21 A.m.),"It is a pleasure to briefly speak on the AboriginalI note that the main provision of the bill is to provide for three parcels of land totalling just over 8,000 hectares to be added to schedule 1 of the land rights act which will lead to the land being granted in fee simple to an Aboriginal land trust to hold for the benefit of Aboriginals entitled by Aboriginal tradition to the use or occupation of the land concerned. There has been a very long period of gestation-I note in the document something like at least eight yearsso getting to this situation has taken a long time. I will first touch on the Reeves report. I think John Reeves QC, a resident of the Northern Territory and former Labor federal member of this parliament, conscientiously prepared a report for the government. It was the role of the parliamentary committee to review that and, as the member for Banks has acknowledged, we thought we came up with some sensible signposts for the future in our report Unlocking the future. I would like to put on the record that I think it is important that the land councils are accountable and that those groups that may, in whitefella parlance, be regarded as minority groups do get a fair hearing. One of my great concerns in listening to the evidence and in mulling over all the issues over a number of months was that those Aboriginal people who were not traditional owners should have their rights protected in some reasonable way. It seemed to me that enormous power was vested with the traditional owners. It was not that there was overwhelming proof that that was used unreasonably on all occasions, but sometimes I think it was. There was an important issue in looking at the land councils, from my perspective anyway, that all Australians, particularly all Aboriginal Australians who live in the Northern Territory, had some reasonable rights in access to land and in their economic future. Of course, therein lies the very serious issue of this balance between traditional Aboriginal control and usage of land and the economic demands of a modern Western democracy. As many in the Northern Territory continually reminded us, they were rather pleased to see, in an inverse way I suppose, the native title issue come forward in the way it did because they said, ‘Now you understand what we have been enduring with the Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 for many years.’ And you understand that, whilst there are certainly legitimate rights for the Aboriginal people, there are also legitimate rights for other Australians. We constantly ran into this problem of what is the most appropriate balance of rights. In terms of the economic future of this country, it is very important that miners have access to land, that pastoralists have access to land and that Aboriginal people are encouraged to use land for economic purposes which enhance their lifestyles as well. The whole reason behind the act, as John Reeves very clearly put to us in his final comments on the report in Darwin, is that, ‘Land rights have been achieved. Aboriginal people have won their land. There is a much more serious issue, or at least as serious an issue, in the welfare of Aboriginal people: their education, their employment and their extreme poverty. We must move from this period of quite activist land rights approach in political terms to a time when we must think about the genuine welfare and well-being of Aboriginal people as human beings.’ In the opportunity that is presented to me this morning, I would just like to highlight those few points. I wholeheartedly endorse the comments of the member for Banks, the shadow minister, about the way we were as a parliamentary committee able to come together under the wonderful leadership of our chairman to present a report which I think will be a useful tool in this process on the path into the future. With those few comments, I wish the bill speedy passage. this debate this morning for a number of reasons. Perhaps the first thing I should do is declare an interest. In 1984 I was an employee of the Central Land Council and my job included at",112,Representatives Main Committee
234,Mr Snowdon (Northern Territory) (10.27 A.m.),"I am pleased to be able to contribute to14378 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 March 2000 that time the rewriting and editing of the history section of the Warumungu claim book. I note the comments that have been made by Justice Maurice in his final report. We need to understand that this claim has taken almost 20 years. That says a lot about the way in which Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory have had to be patient in dealing with issues to do with their rights. I went recently to the handover of Elsey Station which again was as a result of action, in this case by the Northern Land Council, to purchase Elsey Station and then, under the land rights act, to transfer it to a native freehold title after a land claim process. Significantly, of course, one of the comments which was made at that time was that, whilst there was a celebration, there was a great sadness that many of the people who had been instrumental in working on that claim had passed away. So it is with the Warumungu land claim and I am sure the Frewena land claim. I know this is the case for the Warumungu land claim because some of their senior elders, one in particular, died over the last 12 months. We need to understand this experience of going through a land claim process. The Warumungu land claim was a difficult land claim for Aboriginal witnesses. There was intensive cross-examination, very hostile cross-examination, by those opposed to the claim. Yet these people had to lay out in front of a judge their innermost being in terms of their rights and their relationships to land. Significantly, Justice Maurice found in their favour. But significantly also, as my friend and colleague the member for Banks has pointed out, he made significant comment about the trials and tribulations of their history, their history of contact with nonAboriginal Australians-and let me say it is not a pretty one. They had experienced and, indeed, many would argue have continued to experience, a great deal of hostility over many years from those people who originally settled Northern Australia. And they were the subjects of government fiat-they had their lands appropriated by government fiat without any consultation, without any negotiation; they had their reserve relocated because the mining industry was interested in developing the area that they were originally on. I feel very deeply about these subjects, and I say, ‘I declare an interest.’ I declare an interest as I was an employee of the Central Land Council. I declare an interest as the member for the Northern Territory, that I was first elected in 1987. Land rights has been a very central part of my life for 20 years-and I make no apology for it. I have seen the debates which have raged in the Northern Territory and in the broader community about the issue of land rights, where Aboriginal Territorians and Aboriginal Australians generally have been pilloried by conservative political opponents, by governments, by ministers, by chief ministers in the case of the Northern Territory, where they have sought to divide the Northern Territory community generally on the issue of race over the question of land rights. I remember these occasions vividly. I know that in every election I have fought since 1987 my relationship with Aboriginal people has been the subject of attack by the Northern Territory CLP and by my Liberal Party opponents here in Canberra. Well, I tell them: understand me, I make no apology, and I will continue to stand up for something which I think is right. And let me make it very clear to the government: as a result of the article in this morning’s Australian, you be put on notice, you understand that if you seek to amend the land rights act in a way which is opposed by those people in the Northern Territory who are the owners of Aboriginal landMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs De-Anne Kelly)-Member for the Northern Territory, as the Speaker in the main chamber has said, you do not use ‘you’.

Commonwealth government, through you, Madam Deputy Speaker: if you, the Commonwealth government, seek to amend the act in a way which is opposed by traditional owners in",113,Representatives Main Committee
235,Mr Snowdon,"I am talking about the Commonwealth government. I am saying to thethe Northern Territory, it will be opposed by the Labor Party. AndI say to them: look at the very first recommendation of this report, Unlocking the future. It is the central and core recommendation; indeed, the recommendation which qualifies every other recommendation in this document. The first recommendation of this report, which was so ably chaired by my colleague opposite, reads: Recommendation 1 The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 ... not be amended without: traditional Aboriginal owners in the Northern Territory first understanding the nature and purpose of any amendments and as a group giving their consent; and any Aboriginal communities or groups that may be affected having been consulted and given adequate opportunity to express their views. I say to the government: you are on notice-unless you meet that objective, unless we can see very transparently that in any attempt to amend the land rights act you have first had the informed consent of these people, then we will oppose it. AndI expect that my colleagues on the government side of the House who are part of this committee’s report will take the same position. After all, this committee’s report was unanimous. The government has a number of proposals which I understand to be the subject of a cabinet submission. These proposals deal with, among other things, amendment of the objects of the act. There has been no attempt thus far to negotiate with Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory or to inform them about these issues. There has been no attempt to sit down with the traditional owners in the Northern Territory and inform them. Yesterday and today, in Tennant Creek, there is a meeting of the Central Land Council, with all the representatives of the Central Land Council coming together-some 80-odd people from all over the Central Land Council area, which is roughly half the Northern Territory. No-one from this government has gone to the Central Land Council with a set of proposals and said to them, ‘We would like to discuss these with your membership.’ These proposals have, by the way, been put to ATSIC but they have not been discussed with the people of the Northern Territory. As well as the proposal to amend the objects, there is a proposal to break up the major land councils, in a way. What they say is in some part in accordance with the recognition of this report. They propose to form an assessment process for the formation of new land councils. As well, there is to be a plebiscite, conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission, requiring a majority of 55 per cent of the formal vote. Hello, what have we got here? This is the informed consent of an absolute majority. It is not the informed consent of traditional owners. I take the House back to the report of the House of Representatives standing committee, recommendation 7 of which says: Section 21(3) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (‘the Act’) be amended to: define ‘substantial majority’ as at least 60% of those Aboriginal people living in the area; and require the Minister to be satisfied that the appropriate traditional Aboriginal owners have given their informed consent to the setting up of a new land council in accordance with section 77A of the Act. The current proposal being put forward by this government-being discussed by the cabinet, we understand-to have informed consent of those traditional owners says 55 per cent. How does 55 per cent equate to a substantial majority under anyone’s definition? It is a very cute trick by the government in this issue. There is also a proposal to deal with the issue of sacred sites. I will not go into my comments on that issue at the moment because there are other matters I want to address. Needless to say, the proposal is to exclude, in large part, the land councils from their current roles under 14380 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 March 2000 section 69 of the land rights act, which gives them a role in relation to sacred sites. The government needs to understand that this will be a particularly contentious issue amongst Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. I would say to the government that again it should go back to principle No. 1, informed consent, before seeking to impose these laws upon the Aboriginal community of the Northern Territory in relation to amending the land rights act. The government would be well served to go back and look at the two reports produced by royal commissioner Justice Woodward and the subsequent review reports done by Justice Toohey in relation to the land rights act, to see exactly what was said about these particular issues. There is another proposal being put forward by the government about the application of Northern Territory laws. They are proposing to amend the act to provide that certain Northern Territory laws, such as those related to environmental protection and conservation, public health and safety, the supply of essential services and maintenance of law and order or the administration of justice shall apply to Aboriginal land, and there are others. This committee looked at this issue and could find no evidence that there was any difficulty with the application of Northern Territory laws in relation to Aboriginal land. The committee recommended that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs consider whether the powers need to be extended, but then go through a process of consultation, discussion and negotiation. In fact, under core principles, under the committee’s recommendations in that particular chapter on page 136, paragraph 8.40, it says: As stated in the previous chapter, the Committee believes that negotiation and consultation are the best methods of achieving mutually satisfactory outcomes and a productive partnership between Aboriginal people, non Aboriginal people and the Northern Territory Government. This does not propose that at all. There is also a proposition for compulsory acquisition of Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. There is no case for the compulsory acquisition of Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. Again, this issue was looked at seriously by the House of Representatives committee and they unanimously came down with the view that there was no case for this proposal, yet it is a proposal which is being picked up by the minister and, presumably, by the cabinet. They are putting this proposal forward, knowing full well that there has been a process, the Reeves report, and then the House of Representatives standing committee came down with a unanimous report rejecting this proposal. I am not a cynic, but I have serious concerns about what is behind these ideas. There are proposals in the government’s submission to deal with the Aboriginal benefits trust account, to deal with mining provisions of the act. I am sure there has been no attempt to have any process of discussion or negotiation with those people who are affected by these issues. There are a range of other issues which the proposals by the government address, and the bottom line is that unless these proposals have the support of Aboriginal people, unless they have their informed consent, they will be opposed by the Labor Party. We have heard a great deal recently from the Prime Minister about the need for reconciliation. I say to the Prime Minister and this parliament that, if they believe reconciliation is going to be achieved by seeking to divide the community against Aboriginal Australians or if it is going to be poll driven, they are wrong. I have been the subject of a great deal of vilification because of my relationship with Aboriginal Territorians over many years. I can smell a rat. I have a real suspicion about this issue. My real suspicion is that this is another attempt by the Commonwealth government. Shane Stone, previously the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, is now President of the Australian Liberal Party. This is a real attempt by the government to ensure that there is a divisive political debate over the issue of land rights in the Northern Territory and in Australia generally. They will try to capitalise politically on this issue over time as we lead up to the next federal election. That is their intent, I have no doubt. But I put them on notice. If they believe we are going to be cowered by these sorts of attempts to intimidate the Australian community and to vilify Aboriginal Australians, they are sadly mistaken. If the Prime Minister were half a leader, he would do what this committee has done. He would not seek to amend this act, which has been so important to Aboriginal Territorians, without their informed consent as a bottom line. But I fear that will not be the case. My fear is that the Prime Minister, for whatever reason, whether it is a cynical political exercise that I alluded to a moment ago or otherwise-I think there is an intent here, which has been articulated by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in his submission to the cabinet-will attempt to override and bully Aboriginal Territorians to accede to the government’s wishes. There will be a great deal of discussion about these issues in the weeks to come. Among these issues there will be attempts to attack in a pejorative way the way in which the Northern Territory land councils work. Let me say that these organisations are not beyond reproach; these organisations are not beyond improvement; these organisations must be accountable. But again, these are questions which were examined in detail by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. These are questions on which the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs made specific comment. It is worthwhile noting-and the chairman of the committee is going to be on his feet in a moment-that we have not had, as I understand it, a response from the government on the recommendations of this committee’s report. mittee will inform us of that when he gets on his feet. But I can say to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that in the context of the way in which the government are dealing with Aboriginal issues and indigenous issues generally, they must be put on notice. The way you are dealing with these issues is not good enough. Yesterday we had the sorry sight of this parliament gagging the Leader of the Opposition for seeking to take up with the Prime Minister the issue of reconciliation and his lack of leadership on the issue. We are seeing another example of the lack of leadership by this government over these attempts that we will see, no doubt, in the form of draft legislation very shortly to amend the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. What this is about is eroding rights. What this is about is taking away the rights of indigenous Australians. I can say to this House and to the members opposite that they will have a fight on their hands. I do not believe any proposals that they put in accordance with this will get through the parliament.

This legislation enables the resolution of some 20 years of very intense discussion, and sometimes dispute, between various players in the Northern Territory and fulfils, as I understand, the vision and hope of the traditional people and their community to have a secure title to this land, which is crown land. It is not private land, and that should be understood. In fact, all the land transferred under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act since 1976-vested in Aboriginal people in freehold, in fee simple-is land that was not privately owned land in the first instance.

238,Mr Lieberman (Indi) (10.49 A.m.),"I welcome this Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern14382 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 March 2000 something like 50 per cent of the total landmass of the Northern Territory. It is a vast area of land. When the committee which I have the honour of chairing, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, was asked by the minister, Senator John Herron, to consult with the Northern Territory community, particularly the Aboriginal people, about recommendations made in the John Reeves report, we knew that our task was an immense one. We arrived with goodwill, a clear mind and with a serious sense of purpose to listen carefully to the people of the NT-from the Aboriginal communities and the non-Aboriginal communitiesthe NT government and the agencies representing Aboriginal people, such as ATSIC and others, the mining industry and other areas of commerce. We went there with that intent. We did our best. We were a committee made up of members of all political parties. Some of them have spoken today-the member for Banks, the member for the NT and the member for Grey. Madam Deputy Speaker, you would have detected the strongly held, passionate beliefs of some of those speakers. You would have undoubtedly, as a very observant person with insight, also detected the gulf, the feeling of distrust and the feeling that things are not the way they ought to be which was reflected in the comments made, particularly by the member for the NT and by the shadow minister. As chairman, it was a challenge for me. I had to make sure, on the one hand, that the passions of those people were not in any way restricted but, on the other hand, that they would not dominate. The views of the people being consulted by the committee were the views that we had to listen to. We then had to evaluate them and not allow our own sense of prejudice, if there was a sense of prejudice, or a preconceived notion, to dominate. The report which we presented to the parliament last August, which was called Unlocking the future, was a result of those endeavours. The people who gave evidence and made submissions to the committee were very good people whom I respect. Whilst there was disagreement amongst many of them on some issues, there was a common sense of purpose coming through from the community which we consulted-both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people-that there had to be a lot of effort put in to make the life of Northern Territorians better, to ensure that the rights of people were respected, that people were treated equally and that the disadvantage suffered by Aboriginal people and their serious health, education and employment issues were addressed as well. There was a very strong feeling that this was a heaven-sent opportunity, thanks to the minister, Senator Herron, to turn the page on what had been, in the last 25-odd years, a serious division, led by lawyers and anthropologists, with millions and millions of dollars being spent on legal fees, on disputing claims and having to have them proved to the utmost point of law, rather than spending money that became available through royalties and the like on improving the education, health, training, housing and environment of the most seriously disadvantaged people in this country-the Aboriginal people. I sometimes had to constrain my sense of anger that we have seen these huge amounts of money expended on legal fees that could and should have been better directed towards targeted programs to improve the health, education, training, housing, employment and environment of Aboriginal people. In that sense, the Howard government, and the ministers involved directly in these matters, John Herron and Philip Ruddock, have done a magnificent job, along with Michael Wooldridge, in targeting the contribution by the Australian people to improve the health, education, training, housing and environment of our Aboriginal fellow Australians. Some $2 billion now being expended by this government on behalf of Australian taxpayers is being targeted to address those serious issues that regretfully previous governments of both political colours, but particularly the Labor government in the previous 13 years, did not address with the energy and vigour that they should have. MightI also say that it was so obvious to me as chairman of this committee that there was also a lack of true partnership. There were many opportunities being lost by the community, by Australia and by Northern Territorians, in tackling, enhancing and improving the economic position and the self-reliance of Aboriginal people particularly, getting them off welfare so they are not drowned and consumed by welfare. There were so many opportunities that we could see were lost because of the distrust and the political argy-bargy that has been going on for so long. In the recommendations of the committee therefore, whilst they were unanimous, there was division between the government and non-government members on some very core, fundamental issues. They are in our report. The consensus amongst us was that if you are going to look at the legal rights of people who own land in Australia, the first thing you have got to do is to respect their rights. Coming from the coalition government and as a member of the Liberal Party, it is not difficult for me to get passionate about the need for parliaments and political parties of all persuasions to start off any dialogue about public policy or review of public policy on the basis that you respect the rights of people to their hard-won property which has come from hard work, sacrifice and toil and, in the Aboriginals’ case, having had to fight through the courts after having gone through royal commissions to get a legal title to some of the land that they had been dispossessed of. The core value for us was that, if we are being asked to recommend changes to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, we are going to be recommending changes, but we are going to be recommending changes that respect the fact that this land under the control of the land councils, land trusts and the Aboriginal people is owned by them now. It is not government land any longer. It is owned by them. If we were talking to a group of freehold landowners in Melbourne, Sydney or the Gold Coast as a government proposing to do some public policy thing about the management of their land, it would be absolutely fundamental that a modern government and a parliament such as ours would approach any review recognising and valuing those principles. That is, if someone owns a freehold title, it does not matter whether they are Aboriginal or nonAboriginal. If you are a government and you want to change the rules or the game plan, then you should do it recognising that you are talking to someone who owns that land. They have to be treated with respect. You have to have strong public policy justification before you decide that you are going to change the rules about how those people’s land should be changed or managed. That was a very basic fundamental foundation for what we did. What we have done in our report is try to unlock the future. We have said that one of the very important things that needs to be recognised by Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals in the Northern Territory is that their future, because of the nature of the land in question, is very much to do with the future of the mining industry because employment opportunities in outback Australia as we all know are very hard to come by. Employment opportunities through proper mining activities and exploration, sustainable tourism and certain agricultural pursuits, recognising the environment and doing the right thing there, are the way to go to create jobs for young people in the outback, particularly our Aboriginal fellow Australians. What we have done in our report is try to unlock the future. We have, for example, said that one of the very important things that needs to be recognised by Aboriginals and nonAboriginals in the Northern Territory is that their future, because of the nature of the land in question, is very much to do with the future of the mining industry. As we all know, employment opportunities in outback Australia are very hard to come by. But employment opportunities through proper mining activities and exploration-recognising the environment and doing the right thing-and through sustainable tourism and certain agricultural pursuits are 14384 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 March 2000 the way to go in relation to creating job opportunities for young people in the outback, particularly our Aboriginal fellow Australians. So we were united in saying that the mining industry’s future is very much bound up with the future of Aboriginal people and that there have to be appropriate provisions in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act to ensure that mining is encouraged in proper circumstances and that there is a mechanism to bring together people who own the land and the proposers of the mining activity to ensure that a partnership can be forged. We also strongly held the view that one of the problems with the white man in Australia, well intentioned, and Aboriginal affairs is that we have actually fallen into the trap of saying, ‘We can prescribe for your benefit the way in which you should live your life and manage your affairs.’ If you look at all the legislation, state and federal, on Aboriginal affairs, you will find this very prescriptive approach: there shall be a body set up to manage this, and it will be appointed by ministers, subject to consultation. Of course, ATSIC is now-and I welcome this-able to elect all its members, including its chairman, which is great. They are not appointed by a minister. We found that the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, which was developed by the royal commission of Woodward some 25 years ago, supported by a Liberal government, introduced by a Liberal Prime Minister and supported by the Labor Party, was too prescriptive. Reeves, the man who did the review, in my view-whilst I respect him very much-was also falling into that trap because he was saying that, instead of having the number of land councils we now have, four, we shall have 18. Magic: we shall have 18that is the best way to manage the freehold lands of the Aboriginals in the Northern Territory. The committee said, ‘Hang on. The Aboriginal people should be the ones because they own the land now. Like any other group of landowners in Australia, if they want to club together and manage their land, they should fundamentally have the right to decide how it will be managed.’ So our recommendations enable Aboriginal people to have a procedure, with a plebiscite, to create any number of new land councils out of the existing big ones if they want. But it is not a minister who will take the running in these matters, it is the people from the ground up. One of the great hopes I have, one of the strong beliefs I have about the future of Aboriginal people in this country is that the more you can encourage Aboriginal people to make their own decisions, to argue and to negotiate at community level about policy to do with their own affairs, their own life, their own land, the better; the more you will then find that they will come off welfare; the more you will find that they will develop enterprise and initiative and that their health and other things will improve, because there is nothing worse than growing up in a community where you are doomed never to be employed and where your total subsistence will be welfare, from the day you are born to the day you are buried. That has unhappily been part of the-I know not intended-consequence of former governments’ policies, of managing because you thought it was the best way to do it instead of getting out of the system and letting Aboriginal people make their own mistakes, just like white people can in the community. If you own freehold land and you are a member of the non-Aboriginal community, you should be able to organise your own affairs. In local government-and I was a minister for local government in Victoria-it is possible to create and to lobby for new structures, new boundaries for local government, and you make your own decisions to manage the group of lands which you, as a community, individually contribute. So we say in the report that there should not be a prescriptive 18 land councils. What we say is that there should be no limit to the number of land councils, that it is the Aboriginal people who should make that decision, so let us facilitate an election process whereby they can argue it out, have an impact statement, a proper feasibility study, done and then vote on it. Why not? We were bold enough to suggest that there should be another amendment to the act, to say, ‘And furthermore, if a group of Aboriginal owners and their community do not want a land council to manage their land, they can opt out and have no land council.’ What a revolutionary idea-something on which white freehold landowners in Australia would say, ‘What’s different about that? That’s fundamental to our rights.’ But the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory have not got that right. If it is land under the Northern Territory land act, they have to have a land council because parliament said 20-odd years ago, ‘You have to have a land council, brothers and sisters, otherwise you can’t have your land.’ That is crazy stuff. That has got to be swept aside. That is why our report unlocks the future. It gives the Aboriginal people a range of choices-a range that they should have had years ago. Undoubtedly the parliament, the government and the community will consult very well in respect of the government’s response to these reports, and I hope they will pick up the message that we in the committee are trying to give. We were very unhappy with the way in which royalties and income from the lands of the Aboriginals were being distributed. There are no targets; there are no strategies; there is no accountability; there are no audit measures of performance. We made a number of bold and simple but good recommendations that the act be amended to incorporate those things. We also suggested that the advice of one of the most respected organisations in the free world, the Australian Commonwealth Grants Commission, be enlisted to assist in the way in which you can target and give advice in the distribution of these matters. I have run out of time. There are many other things that I could talk about but I will conclude by saying that I will be retiring from parliament when this parliament is dissolved-at the next election. I will work right up to the end and afterwards to try and help bring parties together, to reconcile and to work together and to forge partnerships. I have seen in the Northern Territory some of the most exciting potential to achieve that, with goodwill, with wonderful people, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal. I think this parliament should now, in this first year in our century, do all it can to bring the parties to sit together. I believe if they do that they will succeed in arriving at appropriate amendments that will unlock the future and, hopefully, remove the minister for Aboriginal affairs from 99.9 per cent of the affairs of Aboriginal people. Just as all Australians hope that there will be less government interference in their affairs, so it should be for Aboriginal people. ister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation) (11.08 a.m.)-in reply-I would like first to take the opportunity of thanking the members who have spoken in this debate. Particularly, I thank the member for Indi for his very helpful and thoughtful comments. As one who has admired his contribution in the relatively short period that he has been in this parliament, I am disappointed that he has seen fit to choose such a time to leave us, because I see him as being very much at the peak of his contributions and able to assist very positively in the work that he has been undertaking. I am sure there is a great deal still to be done and I am glad he will continue for the remainder of this parliament. I commend him for the work and the leadership that he has given. The members for Grey, Banks and the Northern Territory also contributed. The member for Grey outlined in a very positive way the legislation that is before us and some of the proper concerns that he had in mind. The member for Banks took the opportunity to commend the legislation that is before us. Really, that was a more appropriate way to deal with this debate, because the balance of his speech, and that of the member for the Northern Territory, was-to use some colloquialisms-‘tilting at windmills’, ‘creating straw men’ and then proceeding with great vigour to knock down the straw men that they had created. I have seen the article in the Australian. I cannot comment on it because I have not seen a cabinet submission. There may well be one that I will see at some time in the future. I have",117,Representatives Main Committee
239,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Min14386 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 March 2000 not seen a cabinet submission and, even if I had, I would not be commenting on a cabinet submission. There are processes by which, at times, cabinet submissions are the subject of consultation within government. People become informed of those proposals. I understand there may have been some discussion with ATSIC about drafts and proposals, but that does not mean they are a cabinet submission. It means that they may have been asked to comment on a matter that could be the subject of a submission to cabinet. It may well be that the baseless allegations of the opposition suggesting that we had been involved in leaking information came from one of the organisations that was consulted. If that were the case, I would of course be disappointed. It may be that opposition members themselves have had a role in relation to that I am not to know. They were certainly enthusiastic in wanting to make some points. I think the points that they were making very much belie their own insecurity. The points they were making about lack of leadership stem from the concern they have about the public perception of themselves and their own leader. If you look at the failure of the opposition leader in so many areas, it is apparent that they are feeling very sensitive about it. It is certainly apparent in the area of taxation: the opposition is failing to give any leadership. It lacks policies. It certainly cannot tell us what it intends to do about income tax, for instance. Another area in which I am vitally interested is the area of immigration. There is a lot of talk and bluster but no leadership, no policy statements, no ideas about where they would take us. In relation to the process of reconciliation, the Prime Minister has been committing the government to reconciliation. The Prime Minister has made it clear on the advice that he is getting from the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation that the task may not be able to be fully completed at the time set by the legislation. This was introduced by the Labor Party when they were in office albeit with support from us. It was certainly appropriate for the Prime Minister to indicate the nature of the counsel and advice that he was getting, that the arbitrary date that had been established 10 years ago may not be able to be met. And there is a lot of truth in that. People believe that reconciliation is only going to come from a meeting of minds amongst the peoples of Australia. The process of developing a people’s movement, of bringing people on board, of talking these issues through, is one that will need to be ongoing. But the commitment of the government should not be in doubt. The Prime Minister has reiterated that commitment. The Prime Minister is providing leadership. In relation to these matters, I find that it is the opposition that want to create division. Here is an area in which they could be bipartisan. They could work with us; they do not have to be out there creating straw men. They do not have to bring motions into the parliament, trying to have parliament debate them as a matter of urgency when there is time on the agenda each day to put matters up for a structured debate-and they could have. The Leader of the Opposition came into the parliament yesterday without advising, it seems to me, the Prime Minister. Otherwise he would have been there. He wanted to trap the government into a debate in order to be able to create this straw man. That is not about leadership on the opposition’s part. That is not about cooperation. That is not about bipartisanship. It is about division. And the speeches we have heard here today! The members have come in. They have postured. They have made the speeches and then they have gone. It is not about a meeting of minds. The fact is that we are debating legislation that does not warrant any opposition. That is the reality. We are dealing with legislation, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, introduced by the Fraser government. It is an act to grant traditional Aboriginal landowners in the Northern Territory land for the benefit of the Aboriginal people and for related purposes. It does establish land councils, which are appointed under the act, to hear traditional claims over unalienated crown land in the Territory. The act provides for a grant process involving the land commissioner, and the act provides a different process for granting land, where the minister is able to recommend to the Governor General a grant in fee simple to be made over land that has been scheduled in the act. Land can only be included in that schedule by an amendment to the act-an act of parliament. All land in that schedule comprises land that has been put there essentially as a result of agreement. The land to be added to the schedule today in this bill is the subject of an agreement between the Northern Territory government and the Commonwealth to provide living areas for Aboriginal people associated with pastoral leases. In recent years, land has been added to schedule 1 as a consequence of agreements reached between land councils and the Northern Territory government. That land has been the subject of a claim, and the Territory has agreed not to contest it before the commissioner, and that has saved taxpayers’ money. It is an element of cooperation and agreement. Agreement has been reached to facilitate a grant of land which had been recommended for grant by the commissioner, but where others might incur significant detriment if the title to that land were handed over. This is what has happened in this case. The commissioner of the Warumungu land claim near Tennant Creek recommended that portions of the stock route passing through Rockhampton Downs Station be granted to traditional owners. The problem was, however, that the station had infrastructure on the land and had used it as if it were part of the station. Whether that was right or wrong, ultimately the owners of the station, with the support of the Northern Territory government, sought to negotiate an agreement to allow beneficial grants to be made to the traditional owners while ensuring the operations of the pastoralist were not unduly disrupted. The bill that we are now debating gives effect to that agreement and is supported by the Northern Territory government, the pastoralists and the Central Land Council. The agreement was made in 1995. Some comment was made about delay, but that was because there was a need for surveys, for fencing and for other works and actions that were required under the agreement to be completed. It was only on 29 March last year that a letter was sent requesting the scheduling of the land. The amendment will add three parcels of land at Rockhampton Downs in the Northern Territory to the schedule to enable three new land trusts to be established. The land is situated about 100 kilometres north-east of Tennant Creek near the Barkly Highway and comprises parts of areas 14 and 15 of the Warumungu land claim. The land commissioner, Michael Maurice, presented his report in July 1998, and most of the land recommended for grant has since been handed over to the traditional owners. In addition to setting down this part of the land claim, as it relates to the Rockhampton Downs Station, it also settles the Frewena land claim. The land to be scheduled comprises one large and two small parcels of land. The large block of land is shown as the Northern Territory portion 4802 on the approved survey plan of 95/36A and covers an area of 6,257 hectares. It is the eastern part of the claim area and its southern boundary that abuts the Barkly Highway and also incorporates the land subject to the Frewena land claim. The name of the land trust, which will be established for this block, is the Kurnturpala Land Trust. The two small parcels of land comprise Northern Territory portions 4801, formerly of the South Barkly stock route, and 5798, a small triangular parcel of land situated between the NTP 4801 and the land belonging to the Warumungu Aboriginal Land Trust. The size of the blocks of land are 1,252 and 585.4 hectares respectively, and they are situated 50 kilometres north-west of the NT portion 4802. The names of the land trusts, which will be established for each of them, are the Kalumpitja Land Trust and the Kalumpitja 2 Land Trust respectively. 14388 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 March 2000 What is the parliament to conclude from this? Firstly, contrary to some uninformed views that we hear from time to time, particularly in the press, this government is committed to Northern Territory land rights for Aboriginal people. This bill will result in a grant of another three areas of land to Aboriginal people. In the past 12 months, the government has handed over title deeds to six large pieces of land in the Northern Territory, including, only last month, the historic Elsey Station and Central Mount Wedge. I know the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs handed the title over at Elsey, and I attended the ceremony at Central Mount Wedge with the Governor General when that process was undertaken. The government is of the view that granting land claims under the Northern Territory land rights act is a very important part of the process of reconciliation and will continue to support the granting of land to Aboriginal people under the act. Secondly, some of our political opponents who continue to claim that the Northern Territory government is opposed to land rights and who vote against reasonable measures, such as those contained in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 2), which were to give effect only to an agreement that the Labor government had reached with the Territory, should think again, and I would encourage them to do so. The facts are that, increasingly, the Northern Territory government is asking the Commonwealth to grant land after it has reached an agreement with land councils. The bill is a good example of how the government, and I believe taxpayers, would prefer to see claims settled-that is, by avoiding litigation and land claim hearings and by reaching fair and workable agreements between all parties. I might say that we are more likely to see resolution of those matters in that way if the opposition were to put aside the silly point scoring and the divisive speeches that we heard today, stop trying to create straw men to knock down and get down to the task of working through these issues constructively with us. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 February 2000, on motion by Mr Hockey: That the bill be now read a second time. assure the minister that my speech on this topic will not be divisive. The ALP supports this legislation, and indeed I do; it is long overdue. There has been debate for some time over the years on this topic, but I think it is mainly because of concerns about privacy that it has not been brought on. At this time. I would like to pay particular tribute to a former colleague-the former member for Cook, Stephen Mutch. I know he would be very pleased that this legislation is coming up at long last. He had a particular interest in this topic and, indeed, on 14 October 1996 introduced a private member’s bill, which I spoke on at that time. When I occasionally see him at other functions, he often brings up this topic. The Census Information Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 proposes storing nameidentified 2001 census information for a period of 99 years. Few of us here will be available to see the release of that information, I suspect. It will be very important for genealogical and other research. Only the 2001 census household information which is considered relevant will be stored. The information will be stored by the National Archives of Australia.",121,Representatives Main Committee
240,Mr Hollis (Throsby) (11.24 A.m.),"I am pleased to participate in this debate and I canThe bill also changes the name of Australian Archives to the National Archives of Australia. The name change actually occurred some two years ago, I think, when they moved into the the new archives building but the government neglected to amend the relevant legislation. The cost of the proposal in the bill is something like $11 million over four years. This includes the cost of an extensive public education campaign and the transfer of information to an appropriate archival format. Costs in relation to the name change have already been incurred. It is important that this education program is carried out because I know from past experience that, immediately you start talking about governments storing information, you get a certain amount of scaremongering in the community. You get the inevitable question, ‘What do government want this information for? What are they going to do with it?’ And you will get, as is unfortunately the case in Australia as in other countries, many people with conspiracy theories. They will contend that somehow this is a great threat to human life and existence or civilisation in this country as we know it. The retention of name-identified census information was the subject of an inquiry by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in May 1998. In a report entitled Saving our census and preserving our history, the committee concluded that the saving of name-identified census information ‘for future research, with appropriate safeguards, will make a valuable contribution to preserving Australia’s history for future generations’. I could not agree with that more. The uses identified by the committee for the 2001 census information include the compiling of family trees, genetic research and other historical purposes. The report by the committee does, however, suggest that information to compile family trees is currently available from sources other than the census information, although possibly with less effect. I know that as a fact because I have been very involved for some time in the Kiama family history centre where people compile family histories using the research facilities there. But I think it is more important than just family history. We are talking in this legislation about only the 2001 census. It is very valuable in that it gives us, if you like, a complete snapshot in time of the Australian people. It will be an invaluable and, indeed, a unique record that could be used in future for all sorts of things, not least medical research. There are many ways it could be used. For that reason, I think it is very important. Australia is one of the few countries in the world that used to pulp its census forms. The data was kept but the records, names and addresses have been destroyed along with the census form. This used to happen about 18 months after the collection. Census collection is not cheap. A census costs over $100 million, so it is very important that that information is used. It was my privilege, in those days when we were in government, to serve on the advisory council of the Australian Archives and I served there for some 10 years. Each year I remember the advisory council used to have a very long debate about the retention of the information on the census form, and always in the annual report of the Australian Archives we used to recommend that this information be preserved. Over that 10-year period there was a whole change of membership of that committee and, as new people came on to the committee, they would always enthusiastically come along with the idea that the information should be retained. As I said, it was an expensive exercise collecting it and it always seemed to me to be a dreadful waste that it was just destroyed. Other countries do retain this information. In Britain they retain the information and it cannot be accessed for 100 years. In the United States it is something like 75 years. There has been debate over recent years in Germany about privacy considerations. In the Netherlands there has also been debate about private considerations. It is important that these countries, after long debate, have retained the information and it is good that Australia eventually is 14390 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 March 2000 coming along to this conclusion. I know that there will be debate in the community about it. I remember when I used to be on the Archives council that I always used to raise the question about how we were going to sell the idea to the people about retaining the information. That is why I very much support the education program and I hope it is in some of the popular press, and not the more exclusive press, because that is where the battle is going to come. Maybe if someone could talk to a few talkback radio commentators that might also help, because people will start running a scare campaign out there in the community, talking about ‘government’ and raising the usual questions we have all heard so many times. And we will get those letters coming into the office that talk about conspiracy theories, that link the United Nations in and ask if we are going to send it to the United Nations or how we are going to use this information. We have to answer these questions and we have to say to people how important it is.

Mr Leo McLeayMr Deputy Speaker, I ask that the bill be dealt with in the House. the reason for that? Mr Leo McLeay-I am very happy to advise the Main Committee why. We had a shadow minister who was going to deal with some of these matters up here and the government, without any consultation, gagged the debate in the House on the customs bill. That means that our shadow minister cannot deal with the matters that he was going to be dealing with up here. So if the government is not willing to consult and continue with the program that they were going to do, then we have just got to make different arrangements for ourselves as well. I am happy to allow the member for Throsby to complete his speech and then I will seek the call to do this. remarks. marks. So, in conclusion, I will note that the bill only relates to information from the 2001 census and not to all future censuses. Given the importance of a high quality census, the government believes the decision on future censuses is best made in the light of the experience of 2001. I agree with that very much. I think it will prove to be a success, especially if we can keep all the scaremongering campaigns away, and at that time. I am sure there will be more legislation making sure that the census information that is collected at taxpayers’ expense is retained.

Question proposed: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Second Sydney Airport second airport for Sydney. We have been waiting for years for a decision to be made about a second airport for Sydney. Last week it was reported to be actually on the agenda for a cabinet meeting. But, once again, the making of a decision has proved to be too difficult for the government. The Deputy Prime Minister, who is also responsible for transport, has been reported as saying that a preliminary-whatever that is supposed to mean-decision will be made within weeks, but how many weeks? He has emphasised that the number of options within options are endless-an exaggeration, surely. What he really means is that there are so many politicians with a vested interest in the matter of the proposed location of the second airport that it seems impossible to have a proper objective discussion about the matter and therefore it is impossible to reach a decision. Last year when I spoke about this issue in the Main Committee, the excuse for not reaching a decision was said to be the forthcoming New South Wales election. The gutless government was loath to make a decision in case the decision adversely affected the chances of its candidates in the New South Wales election. It may as well have made a decision and got it over with because, who knows, their candidates may have even done better in the election if the government had bitten the bullet. Let us face it, many people are generally sick and tired of the indecision and procrastination about the question of Sydney’s second airport. It is obvious to most people where the best location for the airport is, but the longer the decision is put off the more difficult it is to make, and more and more obstacles are put in the way of the decision making process. Since the proposal for the location of the second airport at Badgerys Creek was given a favourable environmental impact statement last June, there has been no excuse for the Howard government not to make a decision. Pressure on Kingsford Smith airport will only increase in the next few years. It seems that a crisis point will have to be reached before the government will act, because those currently in government are hoping, perhaps, that they will be out of the government by then and thus be able to avoid making a decision. That is an interesting thought. Recently we have seen the issue raised of using Bankstown airport for regional traffic, an option promoted by the Sydney Airports Corporation, a government instrumentality. Obviously, this is an industry out of control, for we have also seen the Deputy Prime Minister, who is the minister for transport, criticising the corporation for its promotion of this option. It is a sorry state of affairs when the minister responsible for transport and regional services has to attack a body responsible for a transport service. It does not say much for the transport industry when you have key players at cross-purposes with each other. No wonder there is confusion and obfuscation. I want to re-emphasise that the longer it goes on, the worse it gets. It is not going to become easier to make the decision. Experience over the years has shown that delaying the decision over the site of a second airport has only made that decision harder to take, rather than easier.",126,Representatives Main Committee

I seem to have heard a certain person, now a minister, floating this proposition. She hoped, I guess, that the airport would float out of her electorate and off the coast of New South Wales, and that is about as bizarre as the government’s proposals are. There is no magic solution. Sooner or later the cabinet and the government are going to have to bite the bullet. They are going to have to make a decision on where Sydney will have its second airport. We have already had an EIS; it is time a decision was made. Management of Business to make some comment on the proceedings and the remarks made by the member for Watson in closing off the debate earlier. The member for Watson, on the debate on the previous bill before the committee, which the member for Throsby had been speaking on, namely, the Census Information Legislation Amendment Bill 2000, sought to return the matter to the main chamber. He is entitled to do that, but the basis upon which matters are generally returned to the main chamber is that there is some degree of controversy or some degree of difference between the parties over the legislation. It ought to be pointed out for the record, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that is not the case in this situation. This is a matter which arose out of a unanimous, bipartisan report of a parliamentary committee of this House, which thenMr Leo McLeayMr Deputy Speaker, I wish to raise a point of order. The Main Committee has just resolved this matter, and it is probably quite improper for the member to reflect upon the decision of the Main Committee. If he wants to have a debate on where this legislation goes, he can do it in the House. flecting on the Committee. There is no point of order. on the Committee, and I understand that under the standing orders the decision that was taken by the Committee and by the previous occupant of the chair was the appropriate decision and the only one that in the circumstances could be taken. The point I am making, though, is that the reason why matters go back from this place to the House of Representatives is that they are controversial, that there is a difference of opinion between the parties. That is why they should be not in this place, where non-controversial legislation is debated. The nature of the matter which was before the Main Committee-I am not addressing the substance of the legislation-was entirely non-controversial. As I said, this is a bill which arose out of a parliamentary report which had the unanimous support of members of the Labor Party as well as the National Party and the Liberal Party. It is a matter here because, as the member for Throsby himself said in his remarks to this chamber, it had the support of the opposition, of the Labor Party and, therefore, by definition, expressly, it is not a matter on which there is controversy. Yet, for what can only be regarded as a stunt, the member for Watson is able to come in here and then send the matter back. Whenever it comes up again, it will no doubt be debated according to what the member for Throsby said and go through as something which is supported by both sides of parliament. It ought to be put on the record, therefore, Mr Deputy Speakercall the honourable member for Watson on a further point of order.",127,Adjournment

Minister for Health and Aged Care: Phil Noble and Associates government funds for party political purposes. Of particular concern is the need for full and frank disclosure by the Minister for Health concerning his relationship with the international group, Phil Noble and Associates. This company, which is based in South Carolina in Washington, specialises in the use of the Internet for political fund raising and campaigning. In 1997, the Department of Health and Aged Care issued a contract for $126,000 to an Australian company called Canberra Liaison Internet and New Technologies. The purpose of this consultancy was to provide ‘advice on the Internet for provision of department information’. It is understood that the company was established by the Canberra lobby group, Canberra Liaison, for the sole purpose of winning this contract and that they then subcontracted the task to Phil Noble and Associates.

261,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (12.11 P.m.),"I rise today to express concern about misuse of14394 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 March 2000 funded political largesse, receiving a substantial payment for compiling a secret report to assist Peter Reith in his assault on waterfront workers. The Phil Noble and Associates web site makes it clear that the group’s main activity is providing Internet tools and services for political and public affairs professionals. They have no specified health experience and the major clients listed are political parties. The firm’s founder, Phil Noble Jr was recently given a special award as the international political consultant of the year by the Australian Association of Political Consultants. This group had nothing to offer the Australian Health Department and it appears that no other health organisation in the world has seen them as the relevant expert body. The fate of their work for the health department is very unclear. The project was meant to last three or four months but no report was produced and no major changes were made to the health department’s own web site. A proposal for a new web site, called the ‘Health Insite’, has spluttered along for the past two years. The original prototype Health Insite had photos of the minister on each page and connections to his personal web site. It was scrapped after it apparently tested very badly with the initial users. A new design is now being trialed, but the minister must explain why this project is still in the prototype stage when he has promised on several occasions to open a new reliable service providing authoritative health information to the public. It came as something of a shock when I found that this very same group had also advised the minister in the design of his personal web site which was actually put together in Melbourne. It is not clear whether the health minister paid for the advice from Phil Noble and Associates for development of his personal web site but, whether he was paid or not, it is a serious conflict of interest for a minister to personally obtain services from a company which his department is employing at the same time. I note also that the minister’s web site was named by Phil Noble’s politics online web site as one of the top 10 international political sites. The minister was recently quoted in the Australian on 28 October last year boasting of the success he had had in using the site to communicate with his constituents in the last election, emphasising its value to him in the last 48 hours to change the views of young voters. Since these matters started to be commented on in the media, I note that the minister has added a disclaimer to his web site which states: This site was paid for by a lot of people who support Michael Wooldridge, no taxpayers’ funds were involved. These facts leave a number of serious questions that the minister must answer. What is the relationship between the minister and either Mr Phil Noble or Mr Jon Gaul? What were the circumstances leading up to the issue of a contract by the health department in 1997 to Canberra Liaison Internet and New Technologies for $126,000? What work was completed for the health department by this contract and what service to the Australian public was provided as a result? Who funded the web site that the minister established in 1997 and were these funds declared to the Australian Electoral Commission? Did any of the beneficiaries of the health department contract donate services to the minister for personal political campaigning? I hope that the minister is in a position to make a personal explanation of these matters. Minister for Aged Care Nursing Homes: Redcliffe Peninsula Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (12.16 p.m.)-I would like to speak today about a matter of great concern: the treatment the Minister for Aged Care has been receiving over the last few weeks from the opposition. I think it has been absolutely outrageous. I looked back over Hansard to see whether similar cases had occurred and also whether, when a nursing home had closed under the previous administration, this amount of media frenzy had occurred. Her treatment by the media has been absolutely sensational, outrageous and, to say the least, despicable. I want to recount today for the benefit of the House a particular incident of great success in my electorate. Last year, two proprietors of a nursing home on the Redcliffe Peninsula were sentenced to jail for four years and three years respectively for fraud against the Commonwealth. Essentially they were being provided with funding from the Commonwealth to assist with the running of their nursing home, but the benefits of the funding were not filtering down to the residents, which is absolutely outrageous. Residents were receiving substandard care. The owners of the nursing home were ghosting. A number of family members were on the books as employees of the home when, in fact, they lived interstate-in Melbourne in this case-and could not possibly have rolled up for work every day. Nevertheless, they were able to defraud the Commonwealth. It took a long time to bring this matter to justice. I inherited this case from the previous minister who was representing the seat of Petrie and it was amazing that this had been going on for many years. This government prosecuted the two nursing home directors and they will serve time in prison. There were some outrageous things occurring during this time; they were absolutely frightful. That nursing home and the homes on the peninsula caused me a great deal of grief. I received a report from one agency after they had visited that soiled bed linen was being washed with tea towels and other items from the kitchen and that inadequate food was being given to the residents. Clearly the nursing proprietors were penny pinching at the lowest possible level. I am very pleased to say that the conditions in that facility have been rectified. One of the things that struck me in all of this was the high level of support that the nursing home directors received. While this was all going on, I had representations from some well known members of the Redcliffe community vouching for the good character of those people. The residents’ families came to see me and said how wonderfully well cared for their relatives were in the nursing home. But in the midst of all this were the conflicting reports about the home. It is not always a black and white case. One of the things I want to emphasise is that, when we took government, there were 300 facilities that could not be certified under the previous government-they had dropped to a standard where they were incapable of being certified-and now there are only 53. Out of the 53 that are still questionable, 20 are run by the state government and are mainly in Victoria, I am very sad to say. In Queensland we do have a few facilities that are still undergoing checks and we are trying to bring them up to accreditation standard. Accreditation is the most positive step in all of this. There are some nursing home proprietors and nursing staff that are not exactly enthused about accreditation, but most of them do agree that in the end it will provide a quality of care to those patients. It is important to note that 1,500 visits have occurred by the resident classification scale monitor and, in each of those cases, care plans were examined. Some 14,000 care plans were checked; 350 site visits have occurred for accreditation; and 515 homes are ready to go for accreditation. Providing the best aged care service to our elderly must coincide with certification, site visits and spot checks. We are happy to say that seven spot checks have occurred. Only when you have such an integrated policy and system of accreditation can older Australians be assured of quality of care at a standard that they deserve. (Time expired) Banking: Services and Fees Ms JANN McFARLANE (Stirling) (12.21 p.m.)-I want to bring to the attention of the House an issue that I feel passionately about; that is, services provided by our banks. Since 14396 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 March 2000 December last year I have been collecting signatures for a petition that I intend to table in the House on the issue of banks and their eroding service levels-service levels that continue to decline as bank profits increase. My petition contains the following text: The petition of the electors of Stirling points out to the House our unhappiness with the continued increases in fees and charges by the banking sector, at a time when banks are making record profits. We urge the House to recognise that banks do have an obligation to be accessible and to provide a service to the community. We would be hard-pressed to find a major bank in Australia that provides both accessibility and service to the community. Is this bank bashing? No, it is just a sad indication of the reality faced by hundreds of thousands of Australians whose everyday lives are affected by bank services, bank closures and service degradation. I will use an example from my electorate to highlight this growing malaise. In last week’s Stirling Times community newspaper, I noted the headline on page 5-‘Which local branch can they count on?’ This story revealed that Tuart Hill residents were angry about the closure of a local Challenge Bank branch. The residents of Tuart Hill have every right to be angry. Their Challenge Bank branch is to close in April. It is the second bank to close in the area in the past two years and the second Challenge Bank to close in my electorate of Stirling in the last six months. The story went on to quote the Challenge Bank’s spokesperson, Melissa Reynolds, who justified the closure with an amalgamation argument and then went on to say: Our experiences show there hasn’t been a lot of (customer) run-off ... Many customers have cottoned on to electronic banking because they don’t have to wait in a queue. I get disheartened when customers leaving a bank are described as ‘run-off’. Where has the human side of banking gone? The answer is simple: with the thousands of staff who have been retrenched over the past five years in order to cut costs. I find it insulting that, instead of objectively examining the needs of the community, the banking sector wants to educate consumers to operate on the bank’s terms. It is true that some of the electronic services offered by banks are good as they provide convenience for busy people who do not have the time to get to their local bank branch. I am not a Luddite. I use some of the electronic banking services myself. However, I am fit and able and I also have a car. Yet again, institutions in our society are discriminating against the less fortunate and the less able. Banks are charging a higher fee to go into the bank. Long bank queues, staff reductions and the closure of local branches are all symptoms of the changing banking sector-a sector that now focuses on profits and the return to shareholders rather than quality of service. I find it obscene that local pensioners in Tuart Hill will now have to travel across two suburbs to find their nearest Challenge Bank branch and that these pensioners who make the trip to the branch are being charged a higher fee to do their banking over the counter than other customers who use electronic banking .These are the people that can least afford it. But not only pensioners are hit. A local businesswoman, Shirley Sardelic, who owns the Tuart Hill mini-mart is also affected. Small business people who used to get their change from the local banks will now have to travel further or keep more money at home or on the premises. This then increases the risk of armed robbery and break-ins. What is the answer? Since the deregulation of the banking sector-deregulation that was designed to increase competition in order to make banks provide better service and lower fees-the opposite has happened. Bank service has decreased and bank fees have increased. People are really hurting. As a community worker I saw the effects of high bank fees on low income earners, and I continue to see them as a member of parliament. The reality is that pensioners and low income earners bear the brunt of fees as they have small balances and make more transactions. Therefore, banks’ social obligations need to be made clear by government. As a part of my bank fee-bank closure campaign I will be holding a forum for Tuart Hill residents on Tuesday 21 March. This forum will allow local residents to provide input to the ALP social policy and community development caucus committee on the banking issue. The government needs to take a leading role in ensuring that banks live up to their social obligations and give the community a fair go. I will be inviting all residents of Tuart Hill to this forum. To make good policy we need to be in touch with the people that government policy affects-our community. Kings Cross, Sydney what is the worse place in Australia? I can tell you what it is. It is Sydney’s Kings Cross which sits on the border of my electorate. Traditionally it is supposed to be a place for a bit of fun, a bit of amusement, where even the tourists go to have a look. These days I can tell you it is getting worse. It is just full of pimps and pushers and crims, killers, junkies, perverts, derros, standover men, whores, hoods and gangsters. About every evil element a society can produce is wandering around there like a whole lot of wild animals. You need the police less than the ning to spread out of that area. Just one stop up the railway line, at Bondi Junction in my electorate, we are now seeing a lot more drug use, with a lot more needles, syringes and stuff left in the little dark corners where people are shooting up, and the state government is doing absolutely nothing about it. They say the problems are bad out at Cabramatta and now they are spreading to the neighbouring suburb of Canley Vale-they have had 40 shootings this year, I think-while the Police Commissioner is posing for a portrait for the Archibald Prize. And the same thing is likely to happen in Bondi Junction. The violence is of a fairly low level around Kings Cross but it is time we decided to shut it down, to move all these disgusting places out to a particular industrial place, say, on the perimeter of the airport where the planes fly over and people can pursue their evil ways out there. It is a disgrace, a national embarrassment, especially when we are expecting large numbers of people to visit Sydney to see the Olympic Games. But even worse than that, as one of my colleagues said this morning, it is the sort of thing that desensitises young people. Everyone sees it happening gradually and nothing is done. They think that maybe it is not too bad; they will just permit it; they will tolerate it. The word ‘tolerance’ is used these days but it is also much abused. You tolerate people’s failings that they cannot help and you may try and help them but you should not tolerate things that are just plainly evil, plainly bad. And when it starts to spread, then it is time to say enough is enough and something should be done about it. SoI am going to pursue this a little more vigorously from now on. I should have done something about it before but now that I see it right in my parish I reckon it is time that we put more pressure on those people who could do something about it, particularly the local government. They have the planning laws. The use of land is squarely in their bailiwick and there is really little we can do from a federal point of view. You might talk about placing conditions on grants to the local governments to try to force or encourage them to clean up these bad sorts of places. But if we are going to have a tough on drugs strategy and pursue the protection of Australia’s borders to try and interdict a lot of this smuggling of drugs into Australia, we can at least try to attack it from the other side-not the supply side as much as the demand side-by designating certain areas disaster areas from the point of view of drug use and in some way develop a policy, as our constitutional powers permit us, to do something about it.",129,Representatives Main Committee
262,Mr Andrew Thomson (Wentworth) (12.26 P.m.),"I ask colleagues in this chamber:14398 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 9 March 2000 The Port of Botany, they say, is where 80 per cent of the drugs come into Australia. They take those drugs out to Cabramatta and to all the pimps, whores and pushers in Kings Cross. We ought to put them out near the airport closer to the docks where you could do something more about stopping it happening. It is a disgrace, a national embarrassment, and we should put more pressure on that state’s Labor government to stop it. Management of Business this morning between the member for Menzies and the Chief Opposition WhipI would like to make a few points. Firstly, it was earlier agreed between the acting government whip, the member for Indi, and myself that there would be a change in the speaking order to accommodate shadow minister Thomson who was speaking in the main chamber. We do this for shadow ministers, ministers and members all the time. Breaking that agreement, without notice, without warning, is not the behaviour for us to be able to manage within this chamber. I realise it may have been-I was not here at the particular time-an unintended communication mistake. Nevertheless, a simple courtesy between the acting government whip at the time and the acting opposition whip could have cleared up that matter without any disagreement whatsoever. I hope that in future we will go back to having managed changes. If changes are demanded by ministers we accommodate those without any problem-and so we should. To expect that a shadow minister cannot have his needs accommodated in this chamber is unfortunate and, hopefully, it will not happen again. Aspley Rotary Club Kedron RSL Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (12.31 p.m.)-In the very short time that I have available to me I would like to congratulate the Aspley Rotary Club for a fantastic ceremony on Sunday where their Volunteers Abroad program, which was launched by the former parliamentary secretary Kathy Sullivan, was able to be implemented. A number of certificates were given to the members of the Aspley Rotary Club who spent some time overseas and who have contributed to the literacy programs and also to building projects in the Solomon Islands. I was very pleased to be there to celebrate the occasion with them and to present those particular certificates. I would also like to mention the RSL in Kedron and the fine work that they are doing to provide community care packages for older residents in the Chermside area. I was able to celebrate the new graduation class that went through their first program where they go into older residents’ homes and provide contact for them and assist them with shopping and other duties. There are some fantastic individuals in the electorate of Petrie who do provide a wonderful opportunity for citizens out there who are less fortunate, who are not visited by regular groups such as Meals on Wheels and who have absolutely no outside contact. These people from the RSL are doing a fine job and should be commended.

263,Mr Sawford (Port Adelaide) (12.29 P.m.),"In view of what occurred in this chamberThe following answers to questions were circulated: International Year for the Culture of Peace (Question No. 1148) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 15 February 2000: Did UN General Assembly Resolution (a) 52/15 of 20 November 1997 proclaim the year 2000 as the International Year for the Culture of Peace and (b) 53/25 of 10 November 1998 proclaim the period 2000-2010 as the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World; if so, what action is the Government taking to promote and develop a program within Australia and the region in accordance with the resolutions. (a) Yes, and (b) Yes. The Australian Government supports the UN Declarations on the International Year for the Culture of Peace in 2000, and the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World, 2001-2010. For the International Year for the Culture of Peace (IYCP), UNESCO has been designated as the UN focal point for the coordination of IYCP activities, and is consulting Member States, NGOs and other international organisations on possible activities for the IYCP. Although there is no special funding available to finance IYCP activities, the Government is encouraging NGOs and local and community-based organisations to undertake activities under the auspices of the IYCP. In order to raise awareness of the IYCP, I am writing to Commonwealth Ministers, whose portfolio responsibilities relate to aspects of the IYCP, and to State Premiers, to seek their support in promoting the IYCP and to encourage them to identify relevant projects, events and activities that could be badged and promoted as activities under the IYCP. The Australian National Commission for UNESCO, whose Secretariat is in my Department, has sought funding support (USD35,000) from UNESCO’s Participation Program for an Asia Pacific regional conference under the auspices of the IYCP which will be organised jointly by the Australian Academy of the Humanities (AAH) and the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia (ASSA). It will examine the theme: ""Intellectual Foundations for a Culture of Peace"". Details of other Australian initiatives and projects are available on a number of Australian websites, including that of the Conflict Resolution Network, based in Sydney, the UNAA Tasmanian IYCP website, the website of the UNESCO Associated Schools Project in Australia, through the Victorian Department of Education, and an education network website and activities organised through the South Australian Department of Education. Given the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World, 2001-2010, and the widespread and increasing involvement of children in armed conflicts currently taking place around the world, the Australian Government considers it a priority to support international efforts aimed at improving the protection available to children affected by armed conflict. In particular, Australia has been actively involved in the United Nations working group developing the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (the Convention) on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict. Australia supported the adoption of the text of the Protocol which was concluded during a negotiating session held from 10 to 21 January 2000. The Protocol raises the minimum age for recruitment of persons into armed forces and for their participation in hostilities from 15 years (as it is currently in the Convention and international humanitarian law) to 18 years for participation in hostil ities and for compulsory recruitment, and at least 16 years for voluntary recruitment. In addition, the Protocol obliges Parties to maintain safeguards to ensure that when recruiting persons under the age of 18, such persons are fully informed of the duties involved in military service, that reliable proof of age is provided, and that such recruitment is genuinely voluntary and is done with the informed consent of the person’s parents or legal guardians. The Protocol also includes provision for international cooperation and assistance in its implementation. The adoption of a new instrument will benefit children by establishing new legal standards against which international behaviour can be measured. However, without other practical measures to protect children from involvement in armed conflict this will not be sufficient. The Australian Government considers it a priority to continue to support international efforts aimed at improving the protection available to children affected by armed conflict. Goods and Services Tax: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (Question No. 1174) Mr Melham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 16 February 2000: (1) What will be the total cost to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) for compliance with the Government’s Goods and Services Tax.

This estimate is inclusive of those items that could be considered as ‘GST compliance costs’. (2) The Commission as at 18 February 2000 has spent $98,736 in 1999–2000 of the estimated $1m required to implement the new tax system. No estimate on the ongoing implementation costs of the new tax system is available. (3) The Commission will meet these costs from its existing budget as part of its operating costs. (4) No additional funds were allocated in the 1999-2000 budget for GST implementation. (5) ATSIC has recently received a report from a consultant who reviewed the implications of GST and FBT on ATSIC as a funding body. The report suggests an average cost per ATSIC funded organisation for the initial set up and training for GST to be in the order of $10,000. The figure will vary from organisation to organisation depending on the form of current accounting systems and the complexity of the organisation. ATSIC in 1998-99 funded in excess of 1100 organisations, which indicates an initial compliance cost of more than $11m. ATSIC has no current estimate on the on-going compliance costs.
