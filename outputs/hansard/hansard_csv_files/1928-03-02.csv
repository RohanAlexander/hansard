Surely it is possible for both parties-for probably there are faults on both sides-to . drop all humbug and meet in a conciliatory spirit with the object of examining and settling their troubles. We ought to put on one side our party pledges and prejudices and seek to do our best for Australia. It has been hinted that this debate must be concluded to-day. Had the Prime Minister responded to the call of humanity we could have ended the discussion in about two hours. The work people of Australia have declared in no uncertain'way, "" We want work "" ; but the Prime Minister has shown a callous disregard of their urgent need, the like of which I did not think he was capable. He has treated the motion altogether too lightly. There are in Australia to-day at least 100,000 work persons out of employment. member is out of touch with the workers, in our big industrial centres in particular, and his interjection shows his ignorance of the true facts of the situation. National Parliament should 'devote its attention to more closely at this time than that of unemployment. We should do our utmost to find work for the idle hands that are in every State in the Commonwealth. To have 100,000 work people out of employment means that at least 400,000 persons are directly affected as to their means of livelihood. Many others are indirectly affected. But apart from the sufferings of the people-and they are bad enough in all conscience-ther e is the serious financial loss that this unemployment means to the country. The present condition of our employment market means that we are losing at least £15,600,000 per annum, and as this state of affairs has existed for turns, there are 38,600 unionists out of the last six months, we have already lost between £7,000,000 and £8,000.000. If we add to that the accumulated wealth created by those employed on productive works it means that within twelve months this country will lose no less than £31,200,000. From a financial viewpoint alone, gauging it by the lowest possible standards and disregarding human suffering, Australia stands to lose the enormous sum I have just mentioned. When this country is losing so much through unemployment, why does the Prime Minister hesitate to put in hand works which should be undertaken? We are told by honourable members opposite that it is not the duty of the Commonwealth to provide employment for the workers; but I should mention one instance at least in which the Commonwealth should spend money and thus assist in relieving the situation. According to officialfigures,the Government has, since the Estimates were passed, made a saving of £1,375,000. I do not suggest that all the money voted should be spent, but some works which have been authorized should be undertaken. I refer more particularly to an amount of £333,000 in the Postmaster-General's estimates, which should be expended during this financial year in carrying out essential work. Everyone agrees with the old proverb that "" a stitch in time saves nine,"" and the Postmaster-General( Mr Gibson), in pursuing the policy dictated by the Prime Minister and refraining from spending £333,000, is allowing certain public works to fall into disrepair. There is no subject that this I have been in conversation with responsible officers who have said that if men were available certain postal works would be prevented from deteriorating. What does such a policy involve ? When the finances of the country are in a buoyant position the work will be undertaken and the cost will be considerably greater than if it were carried out today. I cannot understand why the national parliament countenances such a thing. The honourable member for Darwin '( Mr Bell), who is usually a very reasonable man, interjected with some ferocity when I said that 100,000 men were out of work. He doubted the accuracy of the statement.. The latest industrial statistics show that although only one-half of the unions send in rework. If that number is multiplied by two we get approximately 80,000 unionists who are unemployed, and it is only reasonable to assume that 100,000",15,Setup

21,Mr Fenton,"The honorablepersons-unionist s and non-unionistsare workless. The Trades Hall Council in Victoria, to which reference has been made by the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Poster) and others, sends out a form known as an unemployment return which contains the following:Month of Name of'Union How many members unemployed at present? What percentage of your total membership does this represent? How does this compare w i th the corresponding period of last year? State reasons for ment What are the prospects for the immediate future ? That form is signed by the secretary of the Trades Hall Council, and on the 21st November, 1927, a return was received by the secretary, Mr E. J. Holloway, giving the number of unemployed unionists who had registered as f ollows:Australian Workers' Union Carpenters Shop Assistants , Implement Makers Builders' Labourers Coachmakers .Liquor Trades Millers Confectioners Female Confectioners Carters and Drivers Municipal Employees Fodder and Fuel Tanners and Leather Dressers. .

It is safe, to assert that these figures have been largely increased since November of Mr Fenton. last year. Returns were received from only 25 of the 100 unions associated with the Trades Hall Council in Victoria. The secretary of the Trades Hall Council in obtaining authentic figures, received information from only a percentage of the unionists associated with the Trades Hall in Melbourne. It would not have surprised me if the Prime Minister, as leader of the Nationalist Government in Australia and acquainted with the actual conditions prevailing had, on the re-assembling of Parliament informed the members of all parties that present unemployas unemployment was so prevalent and there was so much human suffering, it would be wise for Parliament to authorize certain public works to give relief. One would have expected such an announcement from the right honourable gentleman; but he took refuge behind the States and certain organizations whose duty he said it was to provide work. He also said that the.unemployment was of a temporary nature, due largely to the climatic conditions. Some honourable . . 2,000 members know what it is like to be out .. . . 1,500 .. .. 700 of work.

W o m e n and l it t l e c h i l d r e n are s u f f e r in g and he is earnestly p l e a d in g for help. The Mayor of Brunswick has also made a similar appeal for the thousands who are out of work in that district. I ask honourable members, irrespective of their political creed, to treat this subject given by this Parliament to those enin a humanitarian spirit. Why should we say that it is the duty of the State to provide employment ? Surely we should not allow this distress to continue. The Prime Minister had the audacity to say that certain statements made by the Leader of the Opposition would do an injury to Australia. The greatest possible injury will be done to Australia if it comes to the knowledge of the people overseas that in this new country where there is so little done and so much to do there are 100,000 people out of work. If there is any country in the world which should have a progressive developmental policy and should incur expenditure on public works, it is Australia. I am not one of those who compare Australia with the older countries of the world where most of the principal developmental work has been done. In Australia we have only scratched the surface and much remains for us to do. The Postmaster-General, in a weak-kneed way, allowed the Prime Minister to reduce expenditure in his department which, I believe, is paying well. Eveni f it were not showing a credit balance it would not trouble me iu the least, because it is ment instrumentality which is assisting to develop the country. It is idle for honourable members to say that this motion has been submitted as election propagandaI hurl the statement back in the teeth of those who made it,-whe n the representatives of churches in the cities and the presidents of shires in the country are united for the pui'pose of succoring those in, distress. Is it sughim was dissipated as I listened to his gested that the Lord Mayor of Melbourne would convene a meeting at the Town Hall in Melbourne at which representatives of many important organizations were present to discuss the best means of affording relief if the distress Was not acute? ' This Parliament has protected' those engaged in the. dried and canned fruit industries, as well as the growers of Doradilla grapes. Some States have provided farmers with seed wheat, and in Victoria, in districts where the thrip pest has been prevalent, fruit growers have been given work in road making. In the Victorian mallee the State Labour Government is providing chaff at a cost of £10,000 to feed working horses. Assistance has also been readily gaged in the butter industry. If on other occasions we have been prepared to spend money to give relief to sections of the community, surely this Parliament would readily authorize the spending of money to provide employment for' those who, at the moment, are workless. This is a fair and a legitimate demand. It is one to which the heart of every true Australian should respond. Members of the Labour party have never lagged behind in matters of this kind. We have always been to the forefront in granting assistance to any section ""of the community in need of it It is natural, therefore, that we should now be voicing this demand for some measure of relief for 100,000 people who cannot find employment. But I must return to the remarks of the Prime Minister. I should have liked this debate to be conducted in such a way as to leave no cause of complaint on either side, because this is the most important topic that could be discussed by honourable members. Let us consider the feelings of men who are out of work. Let us ena governdeavour also to realize the anxiety which continued unemployment means to their wives and families. How could the Prime Minister airily brush aside such considerations? Yet that is what he did. It was almost criminal on his part to quote what may be regarded as "" cooked"" statistics concerning unemployment when the welfare of so many people is at stake. Whatever confidence I had in tergiversation and duplicity. I do not wish to describe the honourable gentleman as he has been described by certain of his critics. He is a man in authority, and, like the Centurion of old, it is within his power to say to .this man "" Go, and he goeth,"" and to another ""Do this, and he doeth it . "" The right honourable gentleman has at his command the services of trained officials, and I have no doubt that he has in his oflice, collated for him by officers and publicity agents, material enough to deliver 20 or 30 different speeches on as many different topics. Notwithstanding his advantage in this respect he did not, as one might have expected, reply immediately to the motion of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton). Instead he secured the adjournment of the debate so as to come fully armed the following day to deliver his reply. If the right honourable gentleman had spoken immediately after the Leader of the Opposition had resumed his seat, one might have excused him if certain inaccuracies were disclosed in his speech. But having taken a day within which to himself furnish with the latest statistics concerning unemployment' it was inexcusable that he should state the number of unemployed in Australia "" at 8,000 below the figures contained in the latest official returns -Why should any member of this House resort to trickery of that sort when discussing such an important issue? The Prime Minister well merits all the hard things ihat.have been said about him. manipulator of figures. gard his speech as ingenuous and perhaps clever. In my opinion he was guilty of political trickery, and is deserving of the strongest censure. If we were a parliament of jokers, an assembly of light-hearted men engaged in the discussion of a matter that did not touch so vitally the life and interests of the people, there might have been some excuse for honourable gentleman; but in the circumstances his action was unforgivable. It is a matter for deep regret that in recent .times he has not often drawn from the well of truth. Turning now to the migration policy of the Government, I direct attention to the manner in which New Zealand is dealing with this problem. In the Dominion, the Government led by Mr Coates is of the same political colour as that led by Mr Bruce in Australia, though its ideals may not be identical. Like Australia, New Zealand is in an unsatisfactory economic position; but unlike Australia, it is taking steps to meet the situa tion by restricting migration. In the annual report of the New Zealand Department of Migration there appears the following paragraph:In view of the economic conditions ruling at the commencement of the present year it was necessary for a reconsideration of the volume of immigration, and it was decided that during the forthcoming winter the number of assisted migrants should be reduced to a minimum. Action on these lines has been taken on two occasions since the beginning of this year in order to relieve the present situation in New Zealand. In speeches from a public platform and in Parliament, the Prime Minister of the Dominion has stated that his Government is doing its best to improve the economic condition of the people. It has, as I have stated, taken steps to prevent migrants from entering New Zealand whilst the present economic depression continues. Even Mr Amery, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, who recently visited Australia, returned to Great Britain with opinions somewhat modified as to the ability'of this country to absorb migrants. In speeches delivered since his return to the Mother Country, he has stated that the transfer of British people to Australia is not by any means an easy matter, and that great care must be exercised to ensure that those who come to Australia shall be profitably employed. The honourable member for Herbert (Dr. Nott) and other Ministerial supporters, appear to endorse the view of the Prime Minister that the Commonwealth Government has no authority to prevent the in the levity of the right flux of foreign migrants. I challenge that contention most emphatically. When dealing with this subject last year, I quoted section 3K of the Immigration Restriction Act, which reserves to the Governor General in Council complete authority to restrict migration if the economic conditions existing in the Commonwealth warrant such a course. The Government of New Zealand is acting under a similar authority. It is generally admitted that economic conditions' in Australia at the moment are most unsatisfactory. I say, therefore, that it is competent for the Government to take the necessary steps to restrict migration and so relieve the present depression. I have nothing to say personally against immigrants from European countries. Some",16,Setup

The Prime Minister knows that the Government is vested with the necessary authority, and yet he excuses the inaction of his Government by endeavouring to persuade honourable members that any restrictive action might result in grave inholders of an importing firm. He deternational complications. I have in my possession a translation of a speech made by Signor Mussolini, the Prime Minister of Italy, dealing with the migration of Italian nationals to foreign countries. I may add that I obtained this translation from the Foreign Affairs branch of the Prime Minister's Department, so that the right honourable gentleman must know the views of the government of Italy on this important subject. that if Italy is to have any voice in interby this Government. I agree with the national affairs in the future she must enter the next half of this century with a population of 60,000,000. Minister has declared that the migration of Southern Europeans would not seriously affect the economic position of Australia. Official figures show, however, that in the three years, 1924-27, the excess of arrivals over departures of Europeans was 26,000, mainly from Southern Europe. On this basis we may assume that during the last five years we have added at least 40,000 people from southern European countries to the population of Australia. Can it be argued that the presence of 40,000 migrants from the other side of the world, people whose standard of living is below our own, will not have some influence on the Australian labour market? cannot speak the English language. fortunately some unscrupulous employers take advantage of the plight of these foreign migrants. Many of them,-according to consular reports, have to work for their "" keep."" The Government is to be condemned for the ineffective protection afforded to Australian industries by the existing tariff schedule. We have practically an unlimited supply of the raw materials for many industries. If we utilized our raw materials for the metal and textile industries, there should not be a single person unemployed in Australia who was willing to work. In those two industries alone, we should be able to provide employment for all our own people and a considerable number from abroad. The Prime Minister in his speech the other day gave one the impression that he was addressing shareclared that the Government intended to protect Australian industries. Unfortunately, while we are waiting for that protection our people are suffering through unemployment. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) yesterday had something to say about a number of industries which he assured us were to be established in Australia as a Mussolini declares result of the. tariff protection afforded Minister as to the wisdom of British manufacturers establishing branch houses The Prime in the Commonwealth so that Australian requirements may be met by manufacturing concerns within the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, many overseas visitors who come to Australia on industrial missions have a hazy idea as to what Australia should or should not 'do in the way of manufacturing. Lately, Mr W. R. Morris, the well-known British motor manufacturer, has been giving us the benefit of his views. I can assure him that, if he cannot wholly manufacture cars in Australia, he will find that American competitors will do so and oust him from the Australian market.

The policy of tbe present Administration, since it was constituted some five.years ago, has been to aim at the maximum amount of employment for the people of Australia, under conditions which will -not merely give them decent standards of living but also attract migrants of the best class to this country, and thus enable us to work out our own destiny. In my opinion, one of the most potent causes of the present unemployment is the tyranny exercised by the extremist leaders of the labour unions, who dictate to the unions a policy that, although consistently denounced at first by leaders of Labour in both State and Federal spheres, has in the end been adopted because of the cowardice of some and the folly of other politicians. As a result of the operation of this extremist policy, and the political leaders' acquiesopinions. No one would suggest that the cence in it, ruin is facing many thousands in Australia to-day. After the war industrial problems arose in practically every country in the world, but they have generally been solved by the co-operation of labour and capital, by an improvement in technique, and particularly by a stimulation of the morale of the workers in order tion which means an increased wages fund, and further employment. In Australia, however, the extremists have defeated every effort made by the Government to secure industrial peace and cooperation, and in so doing have exercised a tyranny which is almost unspeakable, and is reminiscent of the worse days of persecution in the history of the world. members, including Mr Jock Garden, to Not only have these extremists exerted pressure upon the political leaders of labour, but they have punished even honourable members in this House for holding to their opinions, and have crucibers of the Industrial Mission when they fied them for their convictions and their refusal to immediately bow knee and accept other doctrines. Let me give four instances of such conduct within the last two or three years. In 1926 the industrial referendum was taken. It will be remembered that the leaders of the Labour party in this House said that although the proposals then submitted were not all that they desired, they were a considerable step in Government's proposals in this House, and said they would support them in the country. It is to the honour of the Leader of the Opposition and of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that they did this. But although the proposals had been endorsed in great part by the Labour movement, and had been a part ' of its platform for years, tbe extreme industrialists disregarded that endorsement, and conducted a vigorous propaganda which led to the defeat of the referendum. The members of the Labour party who stuck to their convictions were the same political threatened with expulsion from the Labour movement and prevented from speaking publicly. That is a condition of things such as prevailed in the dark ages, when men were burned at the stake for their Leader of the Opposition and his supporters have ever been guilty of treachery to the principles of the Labour movement, yet for their stand on the referendum they were threatened with expulsion by the extremists leaders. Many Labour men at that time, not having the courage to stick to their convictions, weakly bowed the to secure increased producknee to the extremists, and assisted them to defeat the Government's proposals. Then there was the industrial mission to America.' The appointment of that commission was recognized throughout Australia as a wise step, and the Government's proposals received support from the Trades and Labour Councils. In fact the councils nominated several of their the commission. Because the Government refused to accept those nominations, and accepted instead those submitted by other unionists of Australia, the labour memreturned to Australia were persecuted by the the extremists. One man in Adelaide was hounded from his job simply because he had had the courage to join the mission and to go to America to try to do something for his country. Another member, Miss May Matthews, who had been a labour worker for twenty years, has been denied the right to stand for pre-selection, and therefore cannot be a labour candidate at the next elections. She is being penalized for having had the courage to go to America, and by her observations there, to try to bring back information leading to the betterment of industrial conditions and the establishment of industrial peace in Australia. A similar position has arisen in connection with the industrial peace conference which the Prime Minister proposes to convene in the near future. It remains for the future to show whether the cowardice that has characterized the so-called representatives of Labour hitherto will continue, or whether they will get courage to say that the movement towards the co-operation of capital and labour should be supported, so that production may be increased, the wages fund augmented and employment made plentiful. Let us take another illustration of the manner in which extremists dominate the Labour party, to the injury of the workers. Some time ago the Arbitration Court said definitely that it would grant a working week of 44 hours in particular industries, if certain conditions were observed, so as to ensure that production would be maintained at the existing level. The court pointed out that in its opinion that result could be brought about only by the adoption of piece work. What is the attitude of the extreme men in the industrial movement towards that system? It is shown by the recent statement of Mr Chapman, secretary of the Railways Union of New South Wales.

Is Australia, with its . pulsion. That is the sort of tyranny that can be exnrcised in this country by men appointed to official positions in Labour organizations! They thus prevent others from assisting to increase the production of the country in refusing to allow chem to better their conditions by increasing their own wages, and putting themselves in a position to give their children a good chance in life. The disinclination of labour to co-operate with Capital in Dr. Earle Page. Australia is one of the most potent causes of unemployment at the present time. It not only discourages investment in industry, and lessens the opportunities, but it discourages men from doing their best. Let me now examine the charges levelled by the Opposition against the Government. One is that there has been unrestrained migration to Australia, and that this has brought about a tremendous wave of unemployment. The fact is that, during the last five years, only about 200;000 migrants have come to this country. In 1921, the unemployed, apart from those thrown out of work solely by strikes, represented 9.2 per cent, of the workers registered by the unions. In 1927, despite the fact that our population had been increased by these 200,000 migrants, the number of unemployed had fallen to 7 per cent., so that the migrants could not have displaced workers from employment; in fact the result of their migration was, as it always has been, to increase the opportunities for employment, making greater the total production and the general wages fund. 8.9 per cent, of the membership of the unions reporting. so my argument is not affected, because the number of men out of work last year was not greater than the number out of work five years ago, before those 200,000 migrants came here. The honourable member has said that this country must have an increased population, to ensure its security, and yet he wishes to check the present flow pf migrants. Last year the various Governments brought 47,000 Many of them were women and children, and therefore did not enter the labour market to compete with the workers 3,000,000 square miles of largely undeveloped country ancl barely 6,000j000 people in such a condition that it cannot annually absorb 47,000 migrants, many of whom are not workers ? The suggestion is ridiculous. Between 1880 and 1890,' Australia received 382,000 migrants from overseas, or at the rate of about 38,000 a year. At that time there was only half the present population, and nothing like the development, industries, or opportunities there are now.",21,Avooi Prices Higher Than Ave Anticipated

34,Dr. Earle Page,"Even if that isBetween 1900 and 1910, when Canada had roughly a similar population to that of Australia at the present time, it absorbed no fewer than 982,000 migrants. What was the result? The adverse balance of trade that the Opposition is always talking about disappeared. Bayley) -The honourable member must withdraw that remark. it is unparliamentary. honourable member must withdraw it unreservedly. that does not alter my opinion. honourable member is distinctly out of order! absorbing 982,000 immigrants between 1900 and 1910, and as the result also of the inflow of capital that occurred during the same period, Canada was able to convert a tremendous adverse trade balance into a large favorable balance. It was able to double its production and increase its exports. The population of the dominion were not as faint-hearted as honourable members opposite, who, because there has been a partially adverse season, and a drought in some of the States, and the time payment system has been indulged in too freely, declare that the whole scheme of migration should go by the board. Have they no faith in the future of this country? The Government and its supporters, and the great bulk of the population, many of whom have themselves come from the Old Country, are not afraid of the future, and I shall give figures later to show that there is no occasion for fear. Honourable members opposite attribute the present labour trouble to-a curtailment of public works expenditure. That is a remarkable volte face; because during the Budget debate, honourable members charged me with the crime to public debt had been increased by £2,000,000, or by £6,000,000-ther e was a doubt as to the amount-durin g the last five years. This year, despite loan rebeen obtained. We have tried to stimutrenchment, we are borrowing £7,875,000. Honourable members grumble and say that we should not curtial borrowing, but should keep public works in progress. They neglected to mention that although the Commonwealth has increased its indebtedness by. £9,000,000 in six years, the States have borrowed £200,000,000 in the same period. They omitted to say anyproductive assets in Australia, that Commonwealth loans have been spent which have enabled the country to carry on in a much more satisfactory way than would, otherwise have been possible. Last year the Opposition objected to public borrowing, and now they take exception to its curbut tailment. Although there has been a reduction of loan expenditure, at the instance of the Loan Council, £46,000,000 of loan money is. to be spent this year by the States and the Commonwealth. Honourable members opposite say again that it was a terrible thing to reduce taxation last year by £1,750,000, because the money could have been used to provide employment in the carrying out of public works. This side of the House believe that the best place for surplus money is in the pockets of the people, so that it can be used for developmental enterprises, because in that way it is likely to be spent far more wisely and reproductively than if it were used for public works carried on under Government control for relief. Persons spending their own money take a personal interest in seeing that the best value is obtained for their outlay."" The curtailment of loan expenditure was decided upon after the most careful consideration, and retrenchment was permitted only in the case of works whose stoppage at the present time would not seriously interfere with their becoming ultimately reproductive. A similar course has been followed by the States. NowI come to the Opposition's third charge, that the Government has consistently failed to assist inof having borrowed dustry. I have already said that such an extent that the our policy has invariably been to provide the maximum amount of employment for the people, and the figures prove conclusively that that result has late production, we have increased the opposite now total wages fund of the Commonwealth,",23,Avooi Prices Higher Than Ave Anticipated

The Government has recognized that there mining, industry, and transport-whic h must be encouraged. Ministers have We assisted primary producers to produce the raw materials required and the necessaries of life, and have stimulated secondary industries to increase the population at the quickest rate and making it possible We have comto obtain the highest available value for the goods that are manufactured. But what has been the policy of the Labour party, both Federal and State? It has We have industries which so vitally affect the welfare of the nation. Take agriculture, for example. Yesterday in Queensland a rural workers' award became operative, under which in either dry or wet weather, during harvesting operations or at any other time, the employees may not work more than 44 hours a week. Every one is aware that it is absolutely impossible to carry on agriculture under such conditions. Account must be taken of the We have aimed at weather conditions, or one is hopelessly left Farmers of all shades of political opinion in Queensland are united in holdin connection with ing the view that the award will crucify their industry and confine their operations to areas which they are able to cultivate unaided by outside labour. The Labour party has always been careless in its attitude towards the interests of agriculture. If the arbitration law had been applied to that industry 30 years ago, Avhen secondary industries were brought within its scope, it would have ceased to exist and Australia would have been ruined. A l most every increase in wages and the improvement in the living conditions of and cannedthe men who are engaged in secondary industries has had to be borne by the primary producer and made possible by his labour. Let us now consider the mining industry. It is well known that the Mount Morgan mine, which turned out some of the finest engineers the world has produced, and would have had a considerably longer life if properly looked I were imposed by the government in which the facts adduced by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) was Premier. A similar state of affairs exists throughout the mining industry as a whole, because the Labour party has been recklessly unmindful of the effects of its policy. It is killing the goose that lays the golden egg. I wish to place on record the attitude cf both industrial and official labour towards industry generally. wild idea that if output is restricted unfrom hundreds of documents that that is employment is reduced. That policy is preached and practised all over the Commonwealth. The standard rate of wages must be paid by all industries irrespective of the amount of work that is done. It frowns on the piece-work system. Tbe result of the operation of this policy is that the margiu between the wage paid to (he skilled and unskilled worker has progressively declined, the effect being that between 1910 and 1920, the number of unskilled workers in the Commonwealth increased at a rate four times asgreat as the growth of the population, while skilled workers maintained the same rate of increase, and primary producers become proportionately fewer in number. Thus, Australia is gradually becoming the wage slave of other countries. continue to produce only unskilled workmen and goods that require only the employment it will be impossible to maintain our present standard or to carry on any big industry in competition with the rest of the world. That is the direction in which the policy of the Labour party has been steadily leading us during the last 30 years. But the decline has been much more rapid in the last five or six years, since the extremists obtained coutrol of the movement and jettisoned those who desired to promote the welfare of Australian industry along sane and sound lines. Others were coerced into acquiescing in, and accepting, what they formerly denounced. Thus they were guilty of treachery towards those whom they are supposed to lead. This fact is becoming generally recognized by every person in the community, including the workers. The other day, in Queensland, a gentleman who claimed to be the leader of the unemployed throughout Australia pointed out that the policy of the unions and the Labour party generally, was gradually bringing about a condition of "" high wages for a few and many men out of work and no wages at all."" He said a policy which permitted more pay for less work was no good to Australia, and that we had to exhibit a willingness to do more work for those higher wages. I believe in the payment of the highest wages possible; but the amount of work done must be inI t has the creased commensurately. I can provenot merely my own opinion. At one time the honourable member for Dalley held very strongly the view, "" If you do not do the work you Cannot get the money."" The present Premier of Queensland has, during the last few months, shown courage by telling the workers frankly that neither in Australia nor anywhere else can a 48-hour week standard be obtained by working only 44 hours. The other day Chief Judge Dethridge put the matter plainly in the Arbitration Court when he saidAll unions are keenly anxious for a 44-hour week, but it is another thing to be able to get it. Forty-eight hours with a job is better than 44 without one. This is the real stumbling block in many of these cases for a shorter week. To grant it would mean the loss of If we their jobs. The workmen of the community cannot afford it. There is not enough money being made. If hours were got down to 404, a lot of men would starve. When we get of unskilled labour, down to the question of where the border line exists I have come to the conclusion that if the great majority of workers were to say: "" We will not work more than 44 hours,"" they would pinch tlieir bellies. That is getting down to homely language. I am not troubling about the employers so much. The 44-hour week for every one would never do. It may be that in twenty years time tlie country generally, will have so increased productiveness as to make a general reduction feasible. Eight or nine months ago he saidI am willing to help you to get a 44-hour week, but you can only get it if you produce in 44 hours as much as you now produce in 48 hours. the Government promised to make the 44-hour week uniform . uniform if every one w ill put his back into his work. It should not be necessary for honourable members who sit on this side to tell these home truths to the workers; that should be done by the Labour leaders. Eight or nine months ago Chief Judge Dethridge saidWe are prepared to give you 44 hours if you are willing to work to earn it. There is only one way in which it can be obtained, and that is by making the production available by means of piece-work.",24,Speaker Mr Thing About The Wonderful Increase In Re

43,Dr. Eaelepage,"It can be madeHonorable members are acquainted with the views of Mr Chapman on the question of piece-work; but for their benefit I shall read again what he has saidThe Council of the Australian Railways Union. . . has affirmed more drastically than ever that any member of the Australian Railways Union who accepts tlie bonus for butty gang, piece-work, and similar pernicious systems, will be disciplined even to the point of expulsion. If these men admit the correctness of the Chief Judge's view they are to be expelled from the union! Has any member of the Opposition questioned that attitude? No; they have all taken it lying down. Every one knows that it is impossible to make any progress except along the lines suggested by ' the Chief Judge. What can be said of men who claim to be the leaders of the workers and yet sit idly by while awards are being defied even by employees in Government. It cannot be argued that the employers, who in this instance are the people themselves, have any desire to cut down the wages of the men. During the last few weeks the boilermakers at Walsh Island dockyard threw the whole of the works idle because of a proposal to introduce piece-work, which is contrary to the rules of their union. That is a State Government undertaking. Works in New South Wales has been obliged to consider the advisability of disposing of the undertaking to a private concern as a result of the current trouble. When the Federal Arbitration Court conceded a 44-hour week to the engineering trades it attached to the award what was understood to be a condition that piece-work should be introduced in order to assist the industry to improve production and meet enhanced costs. Walsh Island recently undertook a big contract for the construction of six steel cars a week for the State Railways Department. The management was unable to keep pace with the work and therefore called for more union workers. culty was experienced in obtaining those additional workers; consequently the management offered a bonus on the piecework system The boilermakers' organization asked the management to abolish the system in three days, and said that in the event of its failure to do so they Dr. Earle Page. would have to call the men out of the workshops. The threat has been made that if the work in question is transferred to the Sydney workshops other unions will be involved. It will be seen that the men are disobeying what Chief Judge Dethridge laid down as a condition precedent to a 44-hour week. They not only will not allow their own men to work, but they threaten to force others out of employment. Yet not a Labour leader has the courage to say that this policy, which leads to the sending of work outside Australia, is one of the most potent causes of unemployment, and that it is time a definite stand was taken in regard to it. The New South Wales Railway Commissioners decided on the construction of steel cars mainly as a result of the lessons that were taught by a number of disasArbitration trous collisions,' which showed that wooden cars telescoped easily ancl workshops? caused casualties, a result which could be partially eliminated by the use of steel cars. The conversion of the present stock of wood cars to steel cars has been delayed by the strike, thus increasing the danger to the travelling public in New South Wales. Not merely is employment being interfered with, but the lives, the health and the welfare of travellers are jeopardized because these men will The Minister for not accept conditions that are generally recognized to be necessary to industry. The Labour delegates who accompanied the industrial mission which visited the United States of America advocated on their return a system of payment by results. Yet the unions will not agree to it, and the leaders of the Labour party dare not raise a voice in protest. Sitting suspended from 12.^5 to 2.15 p.m. luncheon adjournment I dealt with the failure of the official leaders of Labour to do their duty to the workers of Australia by showing them clearly that the only Great diffipracticable means whereby a permanent improvement in their conditions, particularly in regard to hours, ean be achieved is by increased production. What is true of the question of hours is equally true with regard to strikes. Sinee we have compulsory arbitration, both Federal and State, a strike is surely an anachronism. Compulsory arbitration surely means that",26,Speaker Mr Thing About The Wonderful Increase In Re
44,Dr. Earle Page,"Before thethe two parties to a dispute place their case before an impartial tribunal, which determines the issue, and the finding or award of that impartial tribunal should be accepted without quibble and be binding on both parties. But we find that, despite this system of compulsory arbitration, there is a continual series of strikes. reprehensible. The point I wish to make is that the leaders of the Labour movement fail to direct against strikes the criticism that might reasonably be expected of them having regard to their production generally. of the situation discloses a very close relationship between the number of strikes and the number of men out of employment. In 1923 the percentage of unemployment in Australia was 7 per cent, of the membership of registered trade unions furnishing returns. figure excludes those industries in which there were strikes or lockouts. In that year there were 256 disputes, and 75,000 men were so thrown out of work. In 1924 the percentage rose to 8.9 per cent., due mainly to the fact that there were 500 disputes, which placed 151,000 men out of work. being practically doubled in these industries greatly increased the general unemployment throughout the country at large. Throughout this debate there have been insinuations that the Prime Minister has tried to camouflage the actual position by what has been deliberately stated to be the "" cooking "" of figures. There is not the slightest justification for that charge. The Prime Minister quoted from an official statement supplied to him by the Commonwealth Statistician, and the figures given by him were absolutely correct. Prime Minister took the opportunity of a day's rest to deliberately "" cook"" the figures. I would describe that as a deliberate lie. It was an act of courtesy on the part of the Government towards the Opposition to give honourable members opposite ample time in which to debate the motion that is now before the House, and it is regrettable that they should have abused their privilege by even suggesting that the Prime Minister would descend to such a despicable thing. The figures, after all, really make no difference to the situation, because they are only relative. They were quoted to give an indication of the exact amount of unemployment which has existed. forded a definite comparison in the only manner in which a comparison could be made. The Prime Minister set out the position in a straightforward manner, and it is unworthy of honourable members opposite to attribute ulterior motives to effect on employment and the right honourable gentleman. During An analysis the last five 'years the loss in wages to Australia, as a result of strikes, was no less' than £7,500,000. The indirect loss was a great deal more than that. The dore) quoted figures to indicate what 100,000 men out of work meant. My This figures show the actual result of strikes which would not have occurred had the leaders of the Labour movement said boldly that they were opposed to anything of the kind. If in their opinion the awards of the arbitration tribunals should not be obeyed, they should say at Once, "" Let the arbitration system be The number of unemployed scrapped."" Honourable members opposite, however, are too prone to advise their supporters to accept any award that is favorable to them, and to decline anything that is unfavorable. I propose to quote some figures relating to the coal industry to illustrate the effect of strikes. The coal industry in Australia has a special tribunal to settle all its disputes, a body specially appointed by this Parliament. During the last five years, however, the loss in wages due to strikes in the industry amounted to £5,500,000. The continual set-backs to the coal industry, due to interruption It has been suggested that the by strikes, have caused a stupendous loss to Australia. They have increased the cost of coal to such an extent that, gradually, the export trade of Australia is being lost. In 1921 we exported 2,771,000 tons of coal, whereas last year we exported .only 675,000 tons. sult of strikes.

A continual rise in the price of coal has been passed on to the community, and that has increased the cost of production in many of our industries. I specifically mention the iron and steel industry, whose existence depends to a great extent upon the price of coal. ceived nothing from that increased price for the last few years. It is entirely the doing of the employers. population in Australia since 1913 is 25 per cent., while the increased output of coal has amounted to 10 per cent., despite the fact that the increase in the number of employees in the industry is 28 per cent. man to-day is smaller than it was from sixteen to eighteen years ago. As a consequence, prices have been raised, causing us to lose a big proportion of our export trade. Eurther, we have lost some of our internal trade: barrass the industries of Australia. Our transport industry, and particularly the iron and steel industry, are very adversely affected by the existing conditions in the coal trade. Exorbitant coal costs practically preclude competition by the Australian iron and steel trade with other countries. abundance of coal near the surface, and the product can be readily mined. Yet we have practically a stagnation of output. As a contrast, other countries of the world, by reason of a sane system of co-operation between worker and employer, have increased their coal production and trade. England, for example, where there was recently a most disastrous coal strike! do England any good. I am surprised at the honourable member raising such a point. No industrial disturbance of recent years has done so much to retard England's endeavour to return to normal conditions. honourable gentleman calls co-operation? ing to point out that if the political and industrial leaders of the Labour party viewed matters sanely, such disastrous During the last five or six years France has successfully concentrated its attention upon improving its industrial production. Although in its effort it has electrified its system of transport and power production, which necessarily means a saving in the use of coal, the consumption of coal in France increased from 45,000,000 tons in 1919 to 60,000,000 tons in 1924. The co-operation existing amongst all parties has resulted in increased production and a consequent increase in the number of industries operating. In 1923, 38,000,000 tons of coal were consumed in Canada, despitethe fact that for the preceding five years the average yearly consumption was only 32,000,000 tons, and that, In other words, the output per during that period hydro-electric schemes were inaugurated which effected a saving of practically 29,000,000 tons per annum. That indicates that the consumption of coal in Canada has practically been doubled. This, again, has been due to coA l l this tends to emoperation among all parties, and the determination to get the utmost out of industry. In Australia the object appears to be continually to engender quarrels between employee and employer. In Queensland, where the honourable member for Dailey( Mr Theodore) was for In Australia we have an some years at the head of the Government, the State railways show an annual deficit of something like £2,000,000, which is reflected in the taxation, railway freights, and price levels of that State. Our overseas shipping has been strangled as a result of these continual industrial quarrels. Last year not merely our own ships, but oversea ships belonging to Great Britain, were held up by industrial extremists, without incurring very much rebuke from the officials of the Labour party. As a result, £1,000,000 worth of trade was diverted from British to foreign bottoms, and Great Britain, our best customer, was the loser.

""We borrowed £27,000,000 overseas during those five years; but that money was not spent in such a way as to interfere with the protectionist policy of Australia, or to endanger the industrial life of the country. It was used primarily for buying goods which could not be made in Australia, or for making payments which had to be made outside Australia. There is much loose thinking in connection with overseas borrowing. Various critics say that, because we borrow overseas, we are destroying the protectionist policy of the Commonwealth, and creating an unfavorable trade balance. The effect is precisely the opposite. As regards the balance of trade, the loan is an invisible export. offset against the interest bills we have to meet overseas. invisible export and the other an invisible import. The fact that Australia has to pay overseas £25,000,000 a year in interest has more or less balanced the loans we have raised overseas -since the war. came back to the gold standard we were able to clear our balances in this way, which would not have been possible except by such an arrangement. not deny that we had been paying interest with borrowed money. We have never yet paid interest with borrowed money. We have had certain payments to make in London, and we have used the money raised there to make them. At the same time we have used the revenue raised in Australia to meet our loan payments in Australia. course, we could have brought to Australia the money raised by loan in London and sent to London the money raised from revenue in Australia. But the only effect of bringing loan money from London and using it here, and sending our own revenue money back to London to pay the interest charges there, would be that we should have to pay double exchange. What we are doing at the preA l l the States as well were sent time saves exchange charges and does not constitute paying our interest abroad with borrowed money. Under the system I have just explained we are paying for our public works out of loan money and paying our interest with our own revenue, as is shown in the budget statement. Such a procedure does not hurt but really helps Australia. What does injure Australia, is suggestions such as that just put forward that we are paying our interest abroad with borrowed money. The Government has been much criticized because of the amount of money which has been borrowed. It must be remembered, however, that the public debt of Australia differs from that of other countries. We are doing many things in Australia by Government enterprise that in other countries are done privately. We have, for instance, installed Governmentowned telephone services and Governmentowned railways. In America the capital The loans overseas are an of the privately-owned telephone systems amounts to £800,000,000, and that The one is an of the privately-owned railway to £4,000,000,000. tleman replying now to the Minister for Trade and Customs? honourable members opposite. I am replying to those members who, when they were leaders, ran away from their responsibilities, and who now run away from their own statements when we seek to nail them down to them. We come now to the manner in which the Government has dealt with the finances of the Commonwealth. It has been suggested that because we have carried on in a certain way, unemployment has been brought about. The contrary is the case. We havefound as a result of experience that the co-operation which the CommonOf wealth Government has been able to exercise with the States has resulted in reduced loan charges, and theformation of sinking funds in a reduction of the rate of interest.

62,Everybody Knows That Before We Dr. Earle Page,"I am replying tomind back to a transaction of bis own, when he was Treasurer of Queensland, he will remember that the cost of raising a loan for the Queensland Government in America was £4 per cent. On the other hand, the charges on the last loan which we raised in America were only £2 10s. per cent., a clear saving of 30s. The important consideration in regard to borrowed money is the effect which it has on production. During the war the percentage of our interest charges to our total production mounted tremendously. Ever since then, however, the rate has been declining. Those percentages were -as follows:1911-12 1921-22 192425 192520 .. 11.83 per cent. If we look at the matter from the point of view of the amount of interest on the debt provided by the various services on which the money was spent and the balance to be provided out of taxation we arrive at the following figures:1911-12 1921-22 192425 19252G .. 7.4 per cent. It will be seen, therefore, that our position is steadily growing better. That is because practically all the borrowing done by the present Government has been for reproductive work, such as the installation of telephones, which have returned not only interest but provision for sinking fund as well. borrowed this money has nothing to do with the present unemployment. It has tended to prevent unemployment, rather than to increase it. The last charge levelled against the Government is that we have created certain expensive commissions. every speaker has said that we have done this at great and needless, cost to the country. The experience of other governments shows, however, that the appointment of commissions has something to recommend it. Take the case of New South Wales, where unprecedented losses in industry and great unemployment were brought about through the passing of hasty legislation. Last year Mr Lang brought down his system of child endowment, without first having the system inquired into by a commission of experts. Speaking as a New South WelshmanI know that that measure practically crippled the State commercially, and brought about a position of business panic and unemployment from which it has not yet recovered. The cost of all the commissions which have been appointed by the Federal Government during the last ten years does not amount to what New South Wales lost in one year, because of Mr Lang's failure to remember the old adage, "" Look before you leap."" The honourable member for Dalley said that we should give the money to the States and allow them to develop their own land settlement schemes without .. 5.51 per cent. interference from the Commonwealth .. 12.57 per cent. Government. Even the Queensland State .. 11.38 per cent. settlement schemes, however, have not been entirely successful. The Samson Vale settlement has disappeared from the face of the earth; and the Beerburrum settlement, so to speak, wishes it could disappear, because everybody there has failed. It is clear that if such 'schemes had been properly investigated in advance .. 2.5 per cent. much money would have been saved to .. 9.3 per cent the people, and there would have been .. 7.8 per cent. more money available to pay wages. was done by the Commonwealth. settled entirely by the State. What would be the effect of this censure motion if it were carried? There would be a general election, and possibly The fact that we have a change of government. What would be the result of such a change? Honourable members opposite would come into power, and would, we presume, put into effect their financial policy.

In his dilemma he told the press and the people of Queensland that they must stick to him, and present a united front, or there was no knowing what price they would have to pay for the money.

The honourable gentleman said that the financiers of London would not negotiate with the Government of Queensland unless it accepted whatever terms they cared to dictate. No sueh demand was made of me by the f nanciers I met, although we discussed together a great many questions affecting the policy of the Queensland Government, including what some people refer to as the repudiation of contracts. No concession, however, was made by me or by the Queensland Government, nor was there any whittling away of the Government's policy. The terms of the loan were not dictated by the financiers of London with whom.

Following the Prime Minister's callous references to the unemployed, honourable members behind him slandered the workers of Australia, thus injuring Australia in the eyes of other nations. Last of all we have the Treasurer attempting to deliver a lecture on the duties of Australian industrialists, and advocating piece-work. I wish the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Hill) Avas present to hear what I am about to say regarding piece-work in the department under his control. The construction of a railway in the far north was recently commenced. workmen it was decided to adopt the principle of piece-work. They entered into an agreement with the department for the construction of certain earthworks. Expenditure amounting, in some in1 stances, to as much as £300 or £500, was incurred in the purchase of the necessary plant; but as soon as the Government found itself in financial difficulties, the Minister repudiated the whole of those contracts. It is easy enough for Ministers to preach doctrines in which they do not believe; but they find it difficult to put them into practice. what is a vice in the workers is a virtue in members of the Government. If that is to be the spirit in which the Government will meet the workers at the suggested peace conference, all I can say is, "" God help the workers."" The Government appears to take a delight in injuring the workers on every possible occasion. Recently it amended the Navigation Act, making it no longer necessary for competent seamen and officers to be employed on vessels of under 50 tons weight. In the most dangerous waters of Australia the only safeguard to the lives of travellers was removed. In its desire to obtain sweated native labour at 3s. a week, the Government dispensed with the services of certificated masters. Yet it asks tralia to attend a peace conference. What can be expected from a government which on every possible occasion stabs the workers in the back? The whole of the defence offered by honourable members opposite has been hyprocritical. about finance. Was there ever a more Mr Nelson. hopeless bungle than we have at present with the Treasurer not only unable to forecast his revenue but also quite unable to approximate his expenditure to his revenue? Parliament has passed bills authorizing the construction of urgent railways and other works, and provision has been made in loan bills for the cost of these works, but the Treasurer,"" unable to approximate his expenditure to his estimated revenue, cannot find the money for them. The works thus suspended would have employed thousands of men not in localities where migrants would have congregated but in portions of AusAs a result of a vote of tralia requiring development. If carried out they would have ""increased Australia's production, and thus have provided more avenues for employment. But the bungling methods of the Treasurer have tied them up. I have information in my possession that would give the lie to the deliberate misquotations of honourable members on the Ministerial side of the chamber. The fact remains that there are 100,000 men unemployed in Australia to-day, and when we realize how many persons are depenApparently, dent on those who are out of work, the present state of affairs is appallingly tragic. Yet the Prime Minister declares that it is not the concern of the Commonwealth Government. If I had the time. I could make that argument look ridiculous and so with all the other arguments used by the right honourable gentleman in dealing with this motion. I could show that lack of administrative ability and the refusal to provide adequate protection for our secondary industries, and adequate means-transpor t and other -for the promotion of primary industries, are the direct cause of the existing unemployment. I know that the motion will not be carried, and that the gag awaits those who want to speak to it ; but it will go down in history that the the industrialists of AusBruce-Page Ministry was the most callous that ever controlled the Commonwealth. more than grieved that the motion tabled by the Leader of the Opposition should have been received as it has been by The Treasurer has spoken honourable members on the ministerial benches, and to be told that it has been submitted only for party political",34,Speaker Mr Thing About The Wonderful Increase In Re

Of what use is it to quote statistics to men who are hungry? Of what use is it to tell them, when they are starving, that the Commonwealth has no money to carry out this or that work? The reason we have so much unemployment to-day is that we have got, so we are told, too far ahead of requirements. South Australia has only one more railway to build.

Yet that is exactly how the proposed peace conference would work out. Honourable members of the Labour believing in the Arbitration Court. I believe in arbitration but only so far as it will meet the circumstances. I do not believe in the present system except as a palliation of present conditions. When the court talks of giving a little of the profit made by the industry to the man who does the work, I shall believe in arbitration, because it will be getting somewhere definite; but it never talks of giving to the working man any of the profit derived from his industry. It strips him naked in the court. I remember the brushmaker's case in Adelaide many years ago. Women went into the witness-box before Mr Justice Gordon, and told him how much they spent in groceries, meat, and clothing, and on dad's tobacco and lodge money; their domestic arrangements were literally stripspent the few pounds their husbands earned.

For him to talk about agitators is for the pot to call the kettle black. There is no greater agitator in manner or language than the honourable member when he is addressing the House. If necessary I could quote statistics to show what a calumniator he was in his attack upon the honourable member for Grey( Mr the necessities of the moment can be proLacey). But I have no desire to quote figures. Nor have I any desire to go through a long, rambling resume of the actions of the Government that have brought about the present unemployment. I want Ministers to try to do something to pull the Commonwealth out of the slough into which it has got. Honourable members of the Opposition have been accused of promoting this debate for the purposes of political propaganda, but it would be a disgrace to civilization if we could not come to a national parliament and call attention to a set of circumstances that has come under our notice. In South Australia. I did not identify myself with the unemployed until a week or two ago, but when I saw. agathering of 2,000 unemployed, all of them healthy, strong men, willing and ready to work, I could not help associating myself with them. I had nothing to offer them from a Commonwealth point of view. I could only tell them that Commonwealth works were being curtailed because of the financial position. word of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that the existing financial system will not allow the Commonwealth to absorb these unemployed workmen on Commonwealth works. I say now what I said to those unemployed, "" To-day you are useless and scrapped, and the Commonwealth cannot feed you. But if war broke out to-morrow, nine-tenths of you would be described as fit to serve. white feathers urging you to join up."" The Treasurer said that if money were borrowed in Australia instead of overseas the commercial equilibrium of the Commonwealth would be disturbed. On the 15th July, 1915, ""Willie"" made the same statement in regard to a Mr Yates. £5,000,000 loan. Since that time, Australia has borrowed over £300,000,000 within its own shores. Now we are told that the country would collapse like a pricked bubble if £20,000,000 were raised in the local market. Loan transactions during the war period showed how little the right honourable member for Balaclava knew of the power to expand credit. I do not say that the cash which the Government requires is available in Australia, but the currency needed to meet vided if the Government so desires. But of course, the god of profit must be served. Anybody who has money to lend must have his 5 or 5£ per cent. At the beginning of the Great War the interestrate on Commonwealth loans was 4 per cent. Mr Fleming, who then represented Robertson, said they were gilt edged securities, and he urged people to put their money into them. In subsequent notations, the rate increased gradually till it reached 6 per cent. The patriots who sooled on other men to fight for them and were not game to enlist and enter the wet trenches and eat tin dog, would not allow even their money to serve the country unless they got a substantial profit from it. Nine-tenths of the men who are out of work to-day have worked themselves out of their jobs. Statistics prove that the productivity of labour was never greater than it is to-day. That is true of the garnering of wheat, the curing of hams, the clipping of wool, and the We have the mailing of boots, hats, tin pannikins, and everything else. Sir Robert Horne said a few days ago that there is no finer type of man in the world than the Australian, but thousands of our men have worked themselves out of their jobs, and the little Australians opposite, having skimmed all the cream off the milk, would allow the real producers of wealth to starve. They would treat the workers worse than the cattle and machinery on You would be sent their farms; they say it is not their responsibility to find employment for the men who need it. If they have no such responsibility, why do they endorse a financial agreement which will enable the Commonwealth to control the finances of the States?

The fact of the matter is that the Treasurer, like his colleagues on the other sidp of the House, is prepared to state his arguments in any way that will meet what he conceives to be the requirements of the moment, without having any regard for the facts. ""We have been advised to urge that labour representatives should be allowed to participate in the coming peace conference. But such a conference will not get us anywhere if the Government persists in its intention to allow representais quite as satisfactory this year as it has tion to bodies other than recognized labour organizations. In our opinion it is essential that the industrialists should distribution of the wealth that is probe permitted to choose their own represeiitatives to' the conference. own part I should be quite willing for bona fide labour organizations to be represented at the conference, for no harm can come to them from hearing what their opponents have to say. The suggestions at the conference are not likely to amount to any thing more than a general adoption of the principle of the survival of the fittest. Such a doctrine will never be acceptable to us. Labour movement has not grown to its present state in five minutes. It passed through much travail before it became sufficiently powerful to compelthe various Governments to pass legislation to regulate the hours of labour and working conditions. Our opponents frequently twit us by saying that organized labour has done nothing to improve the lot of the workers; but looking back over my short life, and thinking of the experience through which I passedI began life as a factory lad, then became a commercial traveller, and ultimately found myself a member of this ParliamentI can see a marked improvement in the standard of living of the common people. Years ago women and children were obliged to work long hours in factory and field for a mere pittance; but to-day the hard work of the nation is done principally by its men. We have very little child labour now, and the ruling wages in those industries in which women are emMr Yates. ployed are infinitely higher than those of the bad old days. Let us assume for a moment that the peace conference is held and that an agreement is reached which will have the effect of establishing as a principle in Australia, payment by results. Let us assume also that the workers agree to accept lower wages and work longer hours than at present. Will that solve our unemployment problem ? It will not. The solution of our problem will not be found in increased production. As the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) pointed out the other night, our storehouses are already full to overflowing and the return for our wool clip been in recent years. It is not more production that we need, but a more .even duced. If we persist in our present Eor my methods and produce more, it will simply mean that the few will be wealthier and the many poorer. We shall have m'ore unemployment than there is at present. What is necessary to enable us to remedy our trouble is a complete change in our economic system. . The first thing suggested is to dispense with interest on capital. I have taken out the figures in connection with the New South Wales The railways, and find that they are not earning interest on the capital invested in them. I am also conversant with the position in South Australia. Before our railways can earn a penny they have to pay an exorbitant amount of interest to the overseas or local money-lenders. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) spoke of paying £25,000,000 overseas, and apparently it will be a perpetual borrowing business to meet interest on loans. But the £1,000,000,000 which Australia owes, capitalized at 5 -per cent., means £1,000,000 a week, which we have to earn before we can pay wages or obtain the ordinary necessaries of life. It is astounding to realize that from the fruits of our labour we have to pay away £1,000,000 weekly in interest. This must be changed, and there will be no industrial peace in Australia until we produce for use and not for profit. It is the duty of the Government to find employment for those who are out of work. At a meeting of the unemployed in Adelaide which I addressed, I suggested that it would be advisable for the men to parade through the main streets, so that the people would realize the seriousness of the situation. I told them that I was prepared to lead them, and, although I was told that they had marched without effect on previous occasions, I persuaded them to form a procession and march through the streets so that those who in the ordinary course of affairs were not brought into close association with the distress in their midst would realize the gravity of the situation. I led those men through the streets, and, for the information of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr honourable members opposite. What are Foster), I should like to relate the attitude adopted by "" Von"" Homburg in that city. The party with which the honourable member is associated would not, during the war, trust that gentleman, who prior to the outbreak of hostilities represented the district of Murray. He was defeated, I think, on two occasions, but subsequently he was again taken to the bosoms of those who had previously supported him. He is now the Attorney General of South Australia. It is amazing to live and realize the hyprocisy preached at that time. The Attorney-General told me that I was simply leading the men up a hill and down again; but, curiously enough, the same morning he arranged for 130 telegrams to be despatched to the different honourable members opposite.

There were instances when the men, after waiting perhaps five minutes for this meagre fare, became so enraged that they would have nearly pushed the hut over. If men who signed up and were prepared to make the best of it would resort to such measures, it is easy to imagine the feelings of men who have wives and children depending on them and have no bread and no treacle.

I want this Parliament to tackle the question of unemployment. I do not suggest that the Commonwealth Parliament can do the whole job. We have a federation of States; each State possesses sovereign rights, and I do not suggest that this Parliament should adopt an unconstitutional attitude and ride rough-shod over State authority. No helpful suggestion has been made by Minister quoted certain figures and endeavoured to minimize the seriousness of the situation.

As the position has been . f u l l y stated by other honourable members on this side, no good purpose would be served by my covering the same ground. The honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Abbott) had something to say about child endowment and national insurance, which, we have been assured, is the settled policy of the Government. Both national insurance and child endowment have been features of Labour policies for many years, and since they have now been adopted by the Government, it is obvious that the Labour party must always have been on sound lines. Had the proposals of the Government w it h regard to both those questions been given effect, the situation to-day might not have been so serious as it is.

It is the right of the unemployed to have the opportunity to work. in Adelaide is little short of desperate, and I question if the State can do much to relieve the situation there. The Leader of the Opposition in the State Parliament ( Mr Hill) made certain proposals recently, but the Premier of that State( Mr Butler) denied that any of the suggestions could be given effect to.

The suggestion was made that the unemployed should take drastic action, even to the extent of If the figures relating to the breaking a few windows. I strongly objected to such tactics, and pointed out that the men's position would be worse than ever, because they would be gaoled by the police. they would, at all events, be fed. for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) is correct, but, unfortunately, before the hungry unemployed could get into a gaol they would have to break the law. asked to be put in gaol. Some time ago many of them were sleeping behind the Adelaide gaol in tents provided by the Government. Several drifted over into the railway carriages, and when they were ejected by the police they asked if they could be placed under arrest and given proper shelter and food.
