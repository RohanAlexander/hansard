0,"Friday, Took Tlie Chair At 10.30 A.m., And Read Prayers. Ister Representing The Minister For Exter","nal Affairs any comment to make, or any information to give to the House, beyond what appears in the press, on the subject of an agreement recently arrived at in London regarding the limitation of naval armaments? agreement has not yet reached Australia. 1 understand that it is being sent by air mail. No agreement was reached on quantitative naval disarmament, but there was a considerable measure of agreement on what is described as qualitative disarmament-the sizes of ships in individual categories, and their tonnages have been limited below the figures fixed by the Washington Treaty. agreement has been signed by Great Britain, France and the United States of America. It is open to adherence by Japan, France, It a l y and other naval powers. As soon as the f u l l text arrives, it will bo made available to honourable members. Mr R, GREEN -This morning's press publishes a statement attributed to the Minister for Defence regarding compulsory and voluntary military training. In view of that statement, and of a letter dated the 26th March, which I received from the honourable gentleman in answer to a letter I forwarded to him asking for f u l l particulars regarding the formation of an in f a n t r y unit at Mur will umbah able member is not entitled to make a statement when asking a question. Minister informed me that the voluntary system of training was at present under consideration. I now ask him if the 27 March, 19S6. Government has come to any decision in this regard, and whether it has yet decided what assistance can be given to ihe formation of voluntary defence units (Hon. &.. J. Bell) in different parts of Australia? honourable member has read only portion of my letter, which does not give the f u l l sense of my reply to him. The policy of the Government is that of voluntary enlistment. That policy is being pursued. Requests have been received fro m different parts of Australia, including Murwillumbah, for the formation of new units. SinceI have been Minister for Defence, the M i l it a r y Board has considered that the funds available for defence purposes should be utilized in connection with what are regarded as mor ; t important matters, and that practice has been followed. It is now proposed to pay special attention to the matter of increasing the strength of the militia. TheM i l i tary Board and I are convinced that that can be done by a well-directed and an organized effort, which w ill embrace the formation of new units. Consideration w i ll be given to the formation of a unit So far, the at Murwillumbah. publishes the statement that outposts of the Japanese army have come into conflict with the Russian forces in Siberia. Can the Minister representing the Minister for External Affairs say whether information has been received as to the extent of the conflict, or has he any other information that would tend to relieve the House of any anxiety it might feel? has been received on the subject from the Government of Great Britain. If a message that will enlighten the House should come to hand during the day I undertake to make it available. rise to make a personal explanation.

The Melbourne Herald of the 26th March publishes the statement that some of the new bombers on order are to cost £1,067,000. This figure was supplied in answer to a question asked last Friday by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde), and represents the cost of all aeroplanes ordered during the last three years. In yesterday's Sydney Daily Telegraph the statement appeared that it is proposed to expend £7,000,000 upon defence before the end of December next. As a matter of fact that sum represents the expenditure for the whole of the present financial year. ister whether there is any truth in the the press that another of his Ministers is about to go abroad, on this occasion to New Zealand, to enter into negotiations with the Government of that dominion?

Since then such an inquiry has been conducted, and the report of the Tariff Board has confirmed the suspicions which wore previously rife. of New South Wales some time ago gavf a large initial order to a newly-formed cement manufacturing firm to enable it to get on its feet, and to encourage competition that might result in a reduction of price. We find, however, that the competition has now faded away, and the very company which that Government went out of its way to assist, is now working in harmony with tbe other cement manufacturing firms in the maintenance of high prices so that they may obtain excessive profits. for which the honourable member stands. a system of fair treatment to the consumers, and reasonable protection to every industry, whether primary or secondary, provided the industry is economic and efficient; or if an infant industry, if it has a prospect of being Tariff Board on the cement industry is very similar to its report on the match industry. I remember that when the proposed reduction of duty on matches was under discussion in this chamber, the honourable member for Yarr a ( Mr Scullin) spoke in a voice charged w i th righteous indignation in condemnation of the Government's scandalous and merciless treatment of a promising industry which provided employment under such ideal conditions. He charged the Government with heartless behaviour in pursuing a policy which would result in throwing hundreds of men and girls on to the streets in the depth of a depression, when there was no possibility of their obtaining other employment. Experience has shown us, however, that the dismal prophecies of such Jeremiahs have not been fulfilled. As a matter of fact, very little opposition has been offered by the manufacturers to the proposed reduction of duties embodied in the present tariff schedule, the reason being, I believe, that manufacturers have learned to adjust their operations to such changes, which, after a year's experience, have proved reasonable. Just before consideration of this tariff schedule began, members of Parliament were circularized by the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures protesting against any The Government reduction of existing duties. I wrote to the chamber asking it to mention any specific industry which had been injured as the result of tariff reduction, but, so far, I have received no reply. It would seem that the chamber is unable to cite any instance of injustice. In regard to this item, where it has been demonstrated that exploitation has taken place, where production is uneconomic, and excessive overhead charges prevail, we should give effect to the recommendations of the T a r i ff Board. In spite of reduced wages, in spite of the reduced price of coal, in spite of the removal of the child endowment tax, It is not. We stand for and in spite of a general reduction of ordinary taxation, the manufacturers have declined to make any reduction. Even during the depression their profits were maintained, notwithstanding the small turnover. According to the T a r i ff Board report, the capacity of the so. The report of the Australian factories was nearly three times greater than their output, and the board stated that it was not reasonable to continue affording tariff protection so that companies which were over-capitalized, and had excessive overhead costs, could continue to take out of the pockets of the users sufficient to pay interest on capital they were not using in the industry. .It has further been shown that, during the depression, there was instituted a system of uneconomic rationing. Instead of the major companies continuing at f u l l production, while the smaller ones closed down, the available orders were distributed over all the firms, and naturally overhead costs became excessive. Only under a. system of monopoly-control which enabled the manufacturers to maintain fictitious prices could such a policy be pursued. The board states that the average profit of Australian companies is 22s. 6d. a ton, and yet we have been assured by those who support this amendment that the price of English cement exported to Australia is only 23s. a ton. I cannot understand why those who, three days ago, advocated that the",11,Division 7 Oir S Pain Ts An D Varnishes
30,Mr Rosbvear,-That is the system,12,Division 7 Oir S Pain Ts An D Varnishes
31,Mr Nock,"interests of the consumers should be considered when the tariff was heing framed should now be prepared to cast that principle to the winds, and support a restoration of duties which would permit the continuation of conditions so scathingly condemned by the Tariff Board. Mention has been made of the natural protection which the cement manufacturing industry enjoys in Australia. It is admitted that, in some indtistries, natural protection is small, because the weight of the commodity concerned is small compared with the price. however, is not the case with cement, where in relation to price the weight is great, and the natural protection is con?eque.nt.ly considerable. Even those who advocate the restoration of customs protection against British cement .say that the London dumping price is only 23s. a ton. transport, charges, including exchange, insurance, wharfage, &c, amounting to £2 7s. 3d., bringing the total price up to £3 10s. 3d. It will thus be seen that Australian cement enjoys natural protection to the extent of £2 7s. 3d. a ton, which is almost 100 per cent, on the production costs of cement in Australia, for it has been shown by the Tariff Board that in Queensland cement can be produced, without, profit, at £2 8s. 2d. a ton; in New South Wales at £2 6s. 5d.; in Victoria, at £2 10s. 2d.; in South Australia at £2 10s. 7d.; and in Tasmania at £2 6s. 5d. Yet the price for Australian cement has averaged £4 10s. a ton, and, in some instances, manufacturers have been making £2 a ton profit. not. prepared to support duties which will enable the manufacturing companies to charge excessive prices. On the other hand, T do not want the Australian industry to be destroyed by the dumping of cement from overseas. It is not. sufficfent that the Minister should tell us that he has power to deal with dumping if it occurs; I want a definite assurance from him that he will take action to protect the Australian industry against dumping. If that assurance is given, I shall be satisfied that no tariff protection is needed to defend the Australian industry against competition from Great Britain or elsewhere, and I shall support the Government's proposal. my desire to protect this national Australian industry against unfair competition, I yield place to no one, but I believe that we should pay due regard to the recommendations of the Tariff Board. In its report, the board makes it clear that its object in recommending the abolition of protective duties on cement is, not to encourage the importation of cement from Great Britain or any other country, but to ensure that the price of Australian cement shall be reduced to a. reasonable level. I have That, a similar object in desiring this committee to carry out the recommendations of the Tariff Board. A good deal has been said about natural protection afforded to this industry. Reference was made to it by tbe honourable member for Riverina( Mr Nock), but last night the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) questioned To that price must bo added the reality of the protection of the exchange that the Tariff Board considers is enjoyed by the Australian cement industry. He quoted Professor Brigden in support of his case, but he would have been more convincing if he had produced figures as to actual cost increases during the time of the depreciated exchange. As a matter of fact, he generalized and merely expounded a theory expressed by Professor Brigden; and, to show that even he was not convinced by his own argument concerning the protective effect of exchange, he was so illogical as to ask that a duty should be imposed if the exchange rate fell. Surelyi f a depreciated exchange can have no protective effect, then the effect of an appreI am ciative exchange cannot be destructive. Regarding what might be considered a fair return, by those engaged in the industry, it has been suggested by the mover of the amendment ( Mr Francis) that the profit made by cement manufacturers is only a fair profit after making allowance for income tax. If it were fair for the cement industry or any other secondary industry to deduct income tax from profit before assessing the rate of profit it would be fair that other industries should enjoy the same privilege. The result would be that none of these industries would be contributing taxes. The full taxation responsibility would be thrown on to the users of commodities.",12,Division 7 Oir S Pain Ts An D Varnishes
32,Mr Mcbride (Grey) [10.58],"I nI t has been said that the rate of profit made by cement manufacturers is not unduly high and that people who invest their money in the industry are entitled to the return. In this connection I direct attention to what the outside public considers is a fair return on money invested. I cite a few of the prices people have been prepared to pay for shaves in cement companies even after the removal of the British preferential duty. .1 cite first the shares of the Swan Cement Company of Western Australia, because that is the company to which the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin) referred last night. According to the West Australian, of the 21st March last, the market price for £1 shares in this company was 31s. Apparently, therefore, the reduction of the duty has not disheartened investors as far as that company is concerned. The Goliath Portland Cement Company's shares M'ere last quoted at 29s. The shares of the Kandos Cement Company of New South Wales were issued originally at 16s., and a dividend of 10 per cent, is paid. The market price for these shares to-day is 23s. 9d. Honourable members will see that investors in this industry are not only not deterred by the removal of the duty, but are also prepared to invest their money in a concern which will yield a very much lower return than has been suggested in this committee. The results of that exploitation of the public by the Australian cement companies are shown by the huge capital reserves held by them. instance of a company making a cash rebate to shareholders. Jobson's Investment Digest of the 16th March, in referring to the Standard Portland Cement Company Limited, revealed that the company had decided to make a return of capital to the shareholders. The directors found the money coming in so rapidly and in such huge quantities that they were embarrassed to find adequate investment for their excess cash and decided to reduce the value of shares by returning £100,000 to holders. The Digest saysThe cash to be returned has been steadily accumulating and the directors have found it increasingly difficult to remuneratively invest part with them even at bolstered prices. it. The Standard Portland Cement Company Limited is one of the companies which it has been claimed are endangered by the reduction of the duties. The market price of the £1 shares of the Australian Cement Company is 33s. 6d., and the dividend paid by the company yields 6.2 per cent to the investor. This is another striking illustration of the willingness of investors to invest money in this industry, over which honourable members opposite say a grave danger is hanging. The average dividend paid by the company in the last three years was 6.8 per cent. Figures concerning the Adelaide Cement Company Limited are illuminating. That company is not advantageously placed, being far removed from important raw materials necessary in the manufacture of cement. Its operations are a striking example of how, with reasonable efficiency, a company, despite location disadvantages-it has to import its coal from Newcastle and to pay the interstate freights referred to last night by the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Price) -is able to operate and pay a 10 per cent, dividend as was paid last year. In January, 1934, the company made a special cash distribution of 12A per cent, out of cash reserves accumulated from profits made in the exploitation of users of cement. Even now, after these huge dividends have been paid and portion of the reserves have been distributed, the market price for £1 shares is 47s. 9d. The 10 per cent, dividend will yield to purchasers of shares at that price considerably less than 5 per cent. This company There is one must he carrying on its business efficiently to be able to show' these huge profits. There is another cement company in South Australia and its shares, too, are at a premium. The last quote I was able to get was 27s. 9d. on the open market. Assertions that the removal of the duty will jeopardize, hamper and* probably destroy the cement industry in Australia are entirely unfounded. Support for that contention is given by the prices which the public are prepared to pay for shares. The directors, however, are holding these shares and refuse to Ordinary shares are not obtainable in the Queensland Cement Company, which is situated in the electorate of Moreton.",13,Division 7 Oir S Pain Ts An D Varnishes
33,Mr Mcbride.,"They are held so tightly that the buying public is not able to invest in them. The last sales of ordinary shares in the Queensland Cement Company were made twelve months ago, and the price was 27s. Since then there have been sales of preference shares. SomeS per cent, first preference shares have changed hands at 348. and the dividend has been raised to 10 per cent., giving a yield at that price of 5^ per cent, to investors. Some6 per cent, second preference shares have sold at 27s. 3d., with an increased dividend of 8 per cent, also yielding 5£ per cent. pany has £41,000 in reserves. ment. also shows that the price of cement is too high. If the British preferential duty were reduced, or even abolished, the Australian companies could carry on. The natural protection would remain, and there has not yet been any contradiction of the Tariff Board's statements in this regard. After examination of the figures supplied to it by the cement companies, the Tariff Board made a supplementary report, which showed that it had overestimated costs of production mentioned in the first report. The board's latest figures have not been disproved by any statement made in this committteo. Examination of the newfiguresobtained from the manufacturers discloses that in six factories operating in three States actual costs were below these estimates by the following amounts:Amount per ton by which actual coats production stated in the board's report. were below board's The following figures show the producestimates. s. d.

The committee has already been informed that imported I regret that I cannot give the production cement produced even under the most cost in Perth, but the users of cement favorable conditions cannot be landed seem to have been treated more considerhere at less than £3 10s. a ton, which ately in that city than in other capital allows 30s. profit to the Australian producers. Any industry that demands a higher rate of profit than that is exploiting the public. I await contradiction of those costs which are contained in the board's report. Briefs given to honourable members by various manufacturers have been produced in this committee; but, if they were referred to the Tariff Board, they would have to be given on oath. Honourable members come here and make statements, but not one of them has disproved the findings of the Tariff Board. The Government's action in this matter is entirely justified. It is significant that after the first report on cement was issued hy the board the cement companies, which had been charging exorbitant prices to users of cement, immediately began to reduce their rates. The following reductions per ton were made:s. d.

39,Mr Mcbride,"That may be so, butcitios. I hear an honourable member refer to dividends and paid-up capital. I remind the committee that the dividend is paid,on the capital and not on the output. It is unreasonable that these overcapitalized cemenlt manufacturing concerns should pay dividends of 10 per cent, on a capital of £5,000,000, although their plants are working at only 44 per cent, of their capacity. In such circumstances a dividend of 10 per cent is entirely unwarranted. It has been suggested that the over-capitalization of the companies was due to their desire to meet the increasing demand for cement in Australia, but I disagree with that view. No prearranged plan was made by the companies. The fact is that investors saw in this industry a remunerative field for the use of their money, and they set to work to establish factories willy-nilly, without any regard for the general condition of the industry. Notwithstanding the nature of the report of the Tariff Board, certain financial interests of this country have intimated that projects for the establishment of two new cement factories will not be abandoned. It is realized, of course, that even under the altered conditions good profits can be made from the manufacture of cement. We could surely have no clearer indication that the proposal of the Government is reasonable. I hope that honourable members, in considering this subject, will pay some regard to the interests of the men engaged in industries dependent upon the cement industry. The Government has already shown its desire to stimulate building activity in the Commonwealth by granting building materials exemption from sales tax and primage duty. The cement companies should, in these circumstances, also be prepared to do their part to stimulate building operations. The new duties will not in any sense jeopardize the cement-making industry, but will rather have the effect of policing it in the interests of cement users. made, the primary producers are all there They will also tend to ensure that only a fair price will be charged for this necessary building material. I trust that the Government will not insist on the retention of the reduced duties on cement. If it does, the cement making industry of Tasmania will be dealt a severe blow and the employment of a large number of people will be jeopardized. The Tasmanian cement manufacturing industry has had a hard struggle. A great amount of capital was expended in establishing, at Railton, one of the finest cement-making plants of Australia. The company has had to readjust its capital in consequence of accumulated losses, and for many years the shareholders received no dividend whatever, although I admit that the statement of the Tariff Board that a dividend of 15 per cent, was paid recently is correct. The attempt that is being made to dump in this country cement manufactured overseas, should not be tolerated. The Tariff Board, in allowing only 14s. 5d. a ton for freight on Tasmanian cement sent to the mainland, was altogether too conservative. At least £1 a ton should have been allowed under this heading. It looks to me as though the Government intends to do all in its power to smash the Tasmanian cement industry. This will be another grave injustice to the island State. The workers engaged in this industry in Tasmania deserve reasonable consideration, but if the present duties are retained they will undoubtedly be called upon to suffer severe hardship. About 150 men are engaged at the Railton cement works, and failure to increase the existing duty will undoubtedly result in many of them being forced to accept the dole. I have not heard any complaints from users of cement about the prevailing prices. Cement is principally used not in the construction of brick houses for working people, but in large water and sewerage works and other undertakings for which governmental and municipal authorities are responsible. It appears to me that "" go-getters"" from overseas have determined to exploit the local cement market, and that the 'Government is assisting them to do so. We all know very well that when any "" hand-out"" is likely to be to receive their share, but the representatives of the primary producers in this Parliament seem to have very little interest in the welfare of the working man. honourable member justify the payment of a dividend of 15 pef cent?",15,Division 7 Oir S Pain Ts An D Varnishes
40,Mr Mahonet (Denison) [11.21],,16,Division 7 Oir S Pain Ts An D Varnishes
41,Mr Archdale Parkhill,"Does thestances of the Tasmanian cement industry, I do. It must bo remembered that the shareholders received no dividend for a number of years. The Government seems determined to cause as much unemployment as possible in Tasmania, because it knows that the Tasmanian Labour Government w ill provide as large a dole as it can for the people who are thrown out of work. The Tasmanian cement manufacturing industry should be encouraged in every possible way. and along the slopes of Brown Mountain, the best deposits of limestone in the Southern Hemisphere, and nothing should be done to cripple the industry that is being developed there. Certainly Tasmania should not be handicapped as against other parts of the Commonwealth simply because it is an island State.. It will be a scandal and a disgrace to Australia if the fine industry at Railton, which has been struggling for many years, is sacrificed to overseas interests by this Government. handicapped by the price of cement, for they use very little of it . I heartily supBoard and the Government were aware of"" port the amendment moved by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis), and hope that honourable members will use their votes to prevent the Government, from destroying one of the finest industries in Australia, which provides employment for thousands of workers throughout the country, and does in j u r y to nobody. honourable members are unable to participate in the benefits which investment in tbe shares of the cement companies offer, they want to smash these companies.

HARRISON (Wentworth) [11.31],I have been very interested in listening to the speeches delivered by honourable members in regard to this item, and to the comments made in regard to was called upon in the first place to make a report on the cement industry, and, arising OTit of representations made by one firm which claimed that no opportunit y was afforded it to give evidence in the first inquiry, a second inquiry was held and presented. Honourable members generally In the circumwho have paid any attention to the crystallized information set out in that supplementary report, cannot help but take in this enterprise notice of the advice tendered to them by the board. As honourable members are aware, a Tariff Board was set up to inquire, not only into the advisability of protecting the industries concerned, but also to safeguard the interests of the consumers; and in this connection I ask why the position of the cement industry was not referred to the board at an earlier stage, seeing We have in Tasmania at Railton, that it has evoked some drastic comments from the board. The first schedule granting protection to the cement industry was brought down in 1914. That was 22 years ago, and since then only one report, other than the reports now under consideration, has been furnished by the board on this industry, and it dealt only with the paper lining of casks and reconmended that the then existing rates of duty should not be altered. Now, after a belated inquiry, the hoard comes to light with certain The"" cockies"" are not recommendations that have been accepted by the Government. Buti f the Tariff the conditions existing in the industry why have they permitted it to develop an unhealthy growth at the expense of the public? Why was this inquiry delayed? Rather than have this belated drastic proposal restrict the further advancement for a long period of the cement industry, I should have preferred steps Apparently, because some to have been taken earlier to restrict the extortion of undue profits from users of cement, thereby teaching the industry a lesson, and compelling it to conduct its future operations on a more healthy basis. Protection is given to assist the development of an industry; but we fin d the cement industry has over-developed, and is, in the main, over-capitalized. Honourable members, when casting their votes on the amendment moved by the honourable the Tariff Board. The board member for Moreton( Mr Francis) cannot help but take into consideration that, in the process of its development, the cement industry has assumed national importance. Furthermore, as the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Nock) has said, it. is also a natural industry. a supplementary report It uses entirely natural products' in the production of cement, but its main value",16,Division 7 Oir S Pain Ts An D Varnishes
42,Mr Mahoney,"lies in the fact that it is a decentralized industry. It is accepted that if the Tariff Board is to give protection or consideration to an industry, a duty devolves upon that industry to consider the interests of the users of its output, that is those who make possible the granting of the protection. In determining whether this industry has played its part in regard to the users of cement we are forced to rely on the only available evidence, which is contained in a very condensed form, in the Tariff Board's report. An examination of that evidence forces us to the conclusion that it has not done so, and that, on the contrary, it has taken advantage of the protection granted to it to exploit the cement users in no uncertain way. Eigures have been advanced to prove that, over the last five years, embracing the worse years of the depression, the price of cement has remained steady. The industry had ample opportunity to take, into consideration the effects of the depression on industry generally, bringing about, as they did, low costs of material and labour, and l if t in g many burdens previously bearing on industrial undertakings; but, with the exception of one or two other industries, the cement makers have been alone in their failure to pass on to the public the benefits of lowered production costs. The fact that they did not play the game to the public, I have no doubt, is the main reason why the Tariff Board was called upon at this late day to make its investigation. The first report of the board was so damning that the manufacturers felt that, if they were permitted to revise their figures, they could establish a better case. Tbey were afforded the opportunity to do so. But what was the result? supplementary report of the Tariff Board was even more damning than the first. Although the cement manufacturers were given ample opportunity to prepare and advance a convincing case, the later figures clearly indicated that the board's original report was f a i r and just. To those who may have gathered the impression that the object of the board's report was to smasli the cement industry, and believe that, if the Government persists in its present intention, such a result is inevitable, I point out that the T a r i ff Mr E. J. Harrison. Board realized the importance of this industry. Ic prefaced its opinion in the supplementary report by saying that the cement industry represented a capital investment of £5,000,000. An y industry that represents a capital of approximately £5,,000,000 must be of immense importance to Australia, and could not be trifled with or tampered with by the Tariff Board without bringing down on the board the drastic comments of the trading community. But, outside a few interested parties, business interests generally have ignored the report. The Tariff Board also pointed out that the industry provided employment for 2,000 workmen. No board can ignore completely the policy of the Government under which it serves, and the Tariff Board mnst take into consideration the thousands of persons engaged in any industry under review. Consequently, it would not take action which would result in placing 2,000 men out of employment. It must have had very good grounds for its recommendation that the proposed alteration of duty would have very little effect on employment in the industry. The board also referred to the fact that, as the industry used 200,000 tons of coal and 10,000,000 paper bags annually, the indirect employment it provided in allied industries bad to be considered. By revealing the importance of the industry, the board laid itself wide open to criti cism. As I see it , no board worthy of its name would, make a recommendation likely to jeopardize the interests of Australian workmen, either by direct or indirect interference with any industry. In analysing the two reports of the board, we discover some extraordinary figures regarding the capitalization of the The cement industry. The board shows that, in its search for the cause of high prices, it formed certain conclusions, one of which was that the industry was overcapitalized, and that plant had been installed f a r in excess of existing or immediately prospective needs. Only two things lead to over-capitalization of an industry, the most important being that it proves attractive to investors because of the possibility of excellent returns. Thus those desirous of sharing in extraordinary profits are brought into the industry. [Quorum formed.'] I pass on from the report of the Tariff Board to draw attention to a statement made hy the chairman of directors of the Kandos company, in his address to the shareholders in June, 1931. Having pointed out that the company was capable of producing 1,000,000 tons of cement a year, and in the peak period did actually manufacture 76,000 tons, he indicated that, as the demand was increasing, additional plant would be required. He then addedTlie cement industry is in a worse position in New South Wales than in any other State. There are far too many companies operating in that State, and auy one of the five large companies in New South Wales could supply afl current requirements. Since 1021, capital invested in cement companies has been increased by over 500 per cent., while productive capacity has increased from 156,000 tons in 1921 to 570,000 tons in 1930. matters worse, it is understood that it is proposed to float a new company; a step which would make the industry very much overdeveloped. Again, in the report of the company for the year ended the 30th June, 1933, the directors statedAlthough there ha,s been a slight improvement in trading conditions during the year just closed, which is reflected in tlie accounts now presented, the position of the cement industry in this State, owing to its overdevelopment and over-capitalization, is faT from satisfactory. There is no need for me to stress the figures in relation to over-capitalization which are contained in the report of the Tariff Board, but I submit that that statement of the managing director of the Kandos Cement Company destroys any future argument that the industry is not over-capitalized and over-developed. I shall now quote further evidence from within the industry, and give to the committee a statement by Mr Symonds, general manager of the Commonwealth Portland Cement Company, in reply to a question submitted to him when giving evidence before the Tariff Board. When askedWhatI aril putting to you is not original, and my colleague raised it earlier in the day -the companies came into existence because the flowers were blooming too prolificacy, so to speak. attractive? he repliedYes, and some of my friends came into the thing quite blindly, without any consideration of the costs at all. The general consensus of opinion within the industry was that it was a moneyspinner, that the flowers were blooming everywhere, and that every one was anxious to pick a bouquet for himself. The industry has been over-capitalized, and now those who have invested their money in it seek to obtain excessive profits, not on the value of the plant that is actually producing cement, but on the whole of the plant installed, whether used or not. That is an important point. The commercial world would show very few failures if businesses could return 10 per cent, on the whole of the capital invested, even when only 40 per cent, of the plant is being used. To make As the action of the Tariff Board was taken on account of the profits of this industry, I desire now to deal with those profits. The. Tariff Board places its finger on the sore point when, in expressing the opinion that the profits were unreasonably high, it adds in relation to its conclusion, "" (c) The profits made by the manufacturers as a whole were unreasonably high."" The honorab'e member for Moreton said that the profit of 10s. a ton is not a reliable guide, because depreciation and income tax should be taken into account when arriving at a reasonable profit. By interjection, I drew attention to a further statement of the Tariff Board on page 4 of its report under the heading "" Profit""There is a universal complaint in the new representations received by the board that the profit margin of 10s. per ton was intended by the board to mean gross profit, and that selling and administrative expenses and taxation would be a charge against this amount. The board has already explained that selling and administrative expenses were included in the amount of 20s. per ton for "" Manufacturing "". W it h Togard to taxation, the board considered this to be a legitimate charge against the profit of 10s. per ton. The board took into consideration all administrative charges before making its computations, and, therefore, the contention that the margin of profits has been reduced, excessively cannot be maintained. 'The thing appeared to be too I desire now to draw the attention of honourable members to the profits made !>y certain companies which. I w ill mention. Cement Company varied from 16.7 per cent, in 1929 to 4.8 per cent, in 1934. have selected the figures for this company in order to show that I am not endeavouring to give only those figures which support my case. capital of the company was reduced by a return to its shareholders of 4s. in respect of each paid-up share and 2s. on contributing shares. clusively that the company could not find any worth-while investment for the money. only 15.S per cent, of the capacity of the works, and in 1934 26.6 per cent, of its capacity. user has been called upon to pay prices which would enable dividends to be paid on the f u l l capital, notwithstanding that only about one-quarter of it was being used in the industry. the Tariff Board issued its report and the duty was reduced, the trading profit of the companv increased from £40,000 in 1934 to £76,000 in 1935, and the dividend rate was increased to 7^ per cent., the actual profit being 11.34 per cent. I have not given the present exchange figures in regard to shares, as the honorhas already done so. that the profit will be about 12.8 per cent, and the dividend 10 per cent, for 1936. As shareholders in manufacturing concerns generally were content to accept reduced returns during the depression, I submit that the figures which I have given show that this company has been in an extraordinarily favorable position. The Standard Portland Cement Company is in a similar position. percentage of profits earned by it in 1933 was 8-57 per cent.; in 1934 it was 11.35 per cent. honourable member for Grey has pointed out, proposes to reduce its capital from £500,000 to £400,000. member stated that, the reason the directors gave was that funds were accumulating rapidly and there was no means of investing them on a remunerative Tho fact that the company proposes to reduce its capital clearly indicates that it is a sound position and has accumulated sufficient reserves to meet any emergency. Mr E. J. Harrison. The profits of the Kandos MrE . J. HARRISON The honourable member's interjection suggests that I he anticipates that I intend to deal with the Queensland Cement and Lime Company Limited. I shall, however, give figures in relation to it . The company's In 1934, the net profit for 1932 was £15,831; it paid a first-preference dividend of 8 per cent and a dividend of 6 per cent, on second preference and ordinary shares. I point That proves conout that that was in the depths of the depression when building activities throughout the Commonwealth had In 1932 its sales represented slumped, and the demand for cement had fallen off considerably. For 1934 the company's net profit was £21,07S, and it It is clear, therefore, that the paid to the holders of first and second preference shares, as well as to its ordinary shareholders, an additional 1 per cent, dividend, notwithstanding, that the works were not f u l l y employed. cement voluntarily. MrE . J. HARRISON -Yes, in 1935, when the profit had increased to £25,963, and the dividends on all shares were 1 per cent, in excess of the rates for the previous year, and the company's depreciation reserve had been augmented by £17,000-fro m £138,000, in 1933, to £.155,000, in 1935. These figures, I Indications are submit, indicate clearly what a moneyspinner this Queensland industry has been. It is true that, in 1935, the company voluntarily reduced the price of its products; for the last four months of the year it operated on a selling price of 5s. a ton below that for the first eight months. That meant a saving of £12,000 to the users of its product, Nevertheless, business was so much better The net that year that the company's profits improved by over 20 per cent. The Goliath Portland Cement Company That company, also, as the Limited of Tasmania, has a preference capital of £143,092, and an ordinary capital of £170,571. A t present The honourable its reserves amount, to £39,371.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Nairn) -The honourable member his exhausted his time. Trade and Customs) [12.1] -The debate hinges largely upon whether the duty of 9d. per cwt. on British cement should be removed. The duty of Is. appearing in the schedule does not actually exist as exchange adjustment represents approximately 3d. per cwt. Various opinions have been expressed in opposition to the reduced duty. outset I should say that the cement making industry is an example of what follows in the wake of excessive protection which in the end may lead to profiteering; and, as stated in the reports of the Tariff Board, it is difficult to clear up such situations when they arise, it would appear from, the argument* advanced in favour of the postponement of the item, that the policy of applying protective duties, instead of adopting prohibitory measures, is not in the best interests of the public; and if the amendment which provides that the item be deferred is agreed to, it must be regarded as an instruction to the Government that the old duty should operate. 50 per cent, reduction should suffice. cwt. As I have stated the net duty is not Is., but 9d. per cwt. If it is the contention of some honourable members that the duty should be 4£d. or 6d. per cwt. instead of the Tariff Board's recommendation that it should be free, I state quite definitely that the adoption of such an amendment would transgress article 12 of the Ottawa agreement which readsHis Majesty's Government in. the Commonwealth of Australia undertake that no new protective duty shall be imposed and no existbut lobbying does occur.

I did not say that lobbying is not permissible; we know that it goes on in connection with almost every item in a. tariff schedule, and the representatives of practically every industry interested resort to lobbying in various forms. Deputations have waited, not only upon me, but also upon other Ministers and honourable members. The volume of literature on this subject from interested parties and direct representatives of the companies concerned has been enormous. A wealthy former member of this Parliament who once presented a petition to the House in connection with what were termed excessive customs duties, and who is now a director of a cement manufacturing company, has been within the precincts of the House supporting the claims of certain companies which, under these excessive duties, have been profiteering.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN A3 the explanation of the Minister for Trade and Customs covers the point of order raised by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) I ask the Minister to proceed with the discussion of the item. agreed to, would transgress article 12 of the Ottawa agreement, and I ask honourable members who have supported that agreement because of the great advantages it confers, to recall the benefits which that agreement confers, particularly upon Queensland in the matter of sugar, pineapples, and other commodities. Surely they do not expect to take advantage of the agreement when it suits them, and to decline to do so when they regard its provisions as detrimental to the interests which they are representing. They should consider that phase very carefully before recording their vote on this item. In this instance, as in others, the British rate of duty has been fixed in accordance with article 12 of the Ottawa agreement. Last night the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) quoted figures which, on investigation, he will find are inaccurate. For instance, he said that wages paid in the industry were £2,000,000 a year, whereas they are less than one-fifth of that amount. On the basis of production of 400,000 tons of cement, 2,000 hands are employed in quarrying and transport of raw materials for use in the manufacture of cement. The wages paid approximate £350,000 per annum. During the last ten years local manufacturers have supplied more than 90 per cent, of the Australian requirements. Imports have been relatively small, and, in the last few years, have included coloured, white and quick-setting cements of types not made in Australia. The stimulus given to cement production and the protection afforded the local industry have led to the installation of plant far in excess of tha needs of Australia. The honourable merrber for Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison), I am not reflecting upon who dealt with the subject of overcapitalization, said that over-production dates back to 1914, when many of tlie companies made excessive profits. If the profiteering covers the war years also, that makes the position even worse. I have not. The Tariff Board has found that excessive profits have been made, and that, as the industry is so heavily overcapitalized, some reduction of duty should be made. Moreover, the companies should reduce their prices so that ether industries may have a reasonable chance to conduct their operations profitably. The absence of external competition permitted the establishment of, or acquiescence in, local prices that were unreasonably high. At the time of the board's inquiry local manufacturers were selling cement at the following prices:Queensland, £4 17s. 5d.; New South Wales, £4 10s. l i d . ; Victoria, £4 6s. 8d.; South Australia, £4 19s. 7d.; and Tasmania, £4 15s. 6d. a ton. Since the Tariff Board made its report there has been a considerable reduction, and, as the honstated, the company producing in Adelaide has reduced its price by 17s. 3d. a ton. Comparisons have been made with New Zealand, and it has been said that manufacturers in that dominion can sell cheaper than in Australia, because they are not controlled by what in Australia is practically a combine. The prices in New Zealand range from £3 19s. 4d. to £4 6s. 5d. a ton. The prices in Australia at the date of the inquiry were higher than the board considered to be maximum reasonable prices by, in Queensland, £1 13s. 7d.; New South Wales, 14s. 6d.; Victoria, 18s. I d . ; South Australia, £1 l is . 5d.; and Tasmania, £1 4s. 8d. a ton. On the information supplied to the Tariff Board there is ample room for a reduction of selling prices. In the past Great Britain has been the principal overseas supplier. The board ascertained that the lowest price connected with a definite transaction was 55s. 6d. c.i.f. Australian ports for British cement, which would result in landed costs free on wharf and excluding duty of, Brisbane, £3 lGs.

The Tariff Board makes an important commentary on the position as prevailing in New South Wales, to show that the industry is not in any way in jeopardy. This reference appears on page 9; I do not propose to read it ; but I commend it to the attention of honourable members. In brief, the paragraph states that the companies have no necessity to fear that they w ill not be able to carry on their operations at a reasonable profit. What the board assesses as a reasonable selling price is set out in a table on page 8 of the report. The board points out that only one company disclosed a profit of less than 10s. a ton, and that, in spite of the period of depression, which restricted the demand, the remaining companies showed profits of from 6 per cent, to 32 per cent. The board has made some stringent remarks on this position. In the course of this debate some honourable members have endeavoured to lead the committee to believe that there was a depressed period when these companies had difficulty in carrying on their operations; and, in support of their contentions, they quoted the instance of the Goliath Company, Tasmania. regret that the honourable member for Denison( Mr Mahoney), who spoke on this matter, is not present at the moment, for I propose to state the true position. As a matter of fact, that particular company, more than any other, furnishes a special instance of excessive profit-making. I propose to cite excerpts fro m the W i l d Cat Monthly, which sets out the profits made by all companies, together with other information in connection with their capital, and other data. In 1935, the percentage profit on the paid-up capital of the company was 14.4 per cent.; in 1934, 12.4 per cent.; in 1933, 7.6 per cent.; in 1932, 5.5 per cent; in 1931, 3.5 per cent.; in 1930, 4.2 per cent.; and in 1929, 1.4 per cent. correct. Adelaide, 8s. had better quarrel with the editor of the Hobart, 5s. 4d. a ton. Wild Cat Monthly. If he doubts the authenticity of these figures, perhaps he w i ll believe the Weekly Share Market Letter, No. 4T2, of J. B . Were and Son, and their opinion on investment in the cement industry. It statesGoliath Cement operates in Tasmania, and is reported to .he the lowest cost producer in the Australian cement industry. The company earned substantial profits last year, equal to 22£ per cent, on ordinary capital, and paid 113 per cent, for the year. At 20s. Od. the shares, 13s. 4d. fully paid, returned 6J per cent. The recent reduction of 5s. per ton in the selling price of cement in Australia is expected to check the increase in profits In other words, the profits w ill not go beyond 15 per cent that has been taking place, but it should not prevent this company from maintaining a rate of earning sufficient to cover the dividend distribution made last year. Does the honourable member require any more emphatic proof than that statement? Even under the new tariff proposal, and in spite of the expressed fears of a redaction of price, the stock and share market considers that this company w ill be able to make a profit of 15 per cent. That company was formed in 1928 to take over the Tasmanian Cement Proprietary's business and a shale deposit at Latrobe. It made a very commendable effort to develop the shala business, but encountered difficulties, and in 1931 the deposit was sold for £14,000 I in Tasmanite ShaleO i l scrip, the immediate loss on the deal being £28,534. To wipe out this loss and adjust the book value of assets, the sum of £85,286, equivalent to 6s. 8d. a share, was struck off the capital.

62,Mr White,"The honourable memberI am glad to see that the honourable member for Denison has now returned. I regret that he was absent when I quoted from the Stock and Share Market report of J. B. Were and Son; but I consider these figures will correct the statements which he made in reference to the company's profits. correct. information of the honourable member that the percentage profit was S per cent, on preferential shares. Hence that company can hardly be described as being on the border-line of penury when it could achieve those figures in lean years. Honourable members who profess to have the interests of the working man at heart, and are anxious to see that he secures employment, should realize that companies such as this were maintaining their profits for their shareholders at a time when other businesses were being wrecked, and many men's employment was in jeopardy. I give an instance: Uoad-making was definitely retarded, because the high price of cement in Australia led to the importation of large quantities of bitumen and pitch for this purpose. I am right. They are as follows:Cwt. 1030-31 193132 193233 193334 193435 materials used with cement in connection with road-making ? top-dressing purposes; they are laid on over a foundation of cement; but cement roads can be made, and many miles of them would have been constructed in Australia if the companies had reduced the price. Instead, they preferred to keep up the price, even though it involved a restriction of output. I emphasize that this occurred at a time when large sums of money might have been spent on road-making, to give widespread employment, and particularly was this so amongst the unskilled. As things happened, this work of construction was definitely retarded. Honourable members who are opposed to the proposal of the Government to put an end to these conditions shut their eyes to the fact that in the worse economic depression Australia has experienced, the high price of cement was a decided factor in keeping I point out for the down employment. With regard to the Queensland company, about which the honourable member for Moreton is so solicitous vent the industry from going out of existence. has not heard what I was about to say.

However, this industry exists under a greater disadvantage than the cement industry by reason of the fact that some of its raw material-butte r and sugar-hav e an established price in Australia which does not bear a true relation to the world parity price of those commodities.

How much has the honourable member considered the consumers? On the first major item in which he has had an opportunity to put this tenet to the test, he falls down on the job. Nobody reading the two excellent reports submitted by the Tariff Board can fail to appreciate that cheaper cement will benefit the users. I fear that the so-called new policy is intended more for political reprisals, and resembles curiously the new protection policy advocated not more than two years ago by Mr Lang, who said that very punitive powers were to be exercised by the government if his party was returned to office. The Leader of the Opposition, himself, speaking on the address-in-reply, on the 1st November, 1934, saidI say this to my friends on my own side of the House: There is nothing to be gained in the general level of employment by protecting an industry which, at the most, can afford employment to only three or four hundepression period, and on several occadred men when, by so doing, we imperil our market for goods in the production of which employment is provided for 10,000 or more of our population. ""Why does he not apply those principles to this item of the tariff, and also the principles which he advocated when speaking on the recent censure motion. I regret that the explanation submitted on this item on behalf of the Government has been so long. If honourable members have any doubt on the matter, I urge them to read again the reports of the Tariff Board. Let me reiterate that no injury will be done to this important industry if the manufacturers in it cease profiteering. If honourable members have any respect for the obligations of the Ottawa agreement, they cannot support the amendment. I contend that this alteration should have been made years ago. Regarding profiteering in other industries, such as the manufacture of paper and glass bottles, the board has made some very scathing comments. These matters should be considered, not from a geographical point of view, or from that of the electorate or the party, with an endeavour to see that the Mr White. people of Australia as a wholethe users of cement are not of a different race from, that of the cementmakers-ar e protected as well as the manufacturers. I ask the committee to accept the recommendations of the Tariff Board. They are thoroughly reliable, particularly as the industry has had two opportunities to submit its case. Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) has dealt with these duties from many aspects, and has liberally quoted figures in an attempt to justify the Government's proposals. He referred to the operations of the Goliath Portland Cement Company, which carries on operations at Railton, Tasmania. A l though this industry is not conducted in my own electorate,' I have watched its progress since its establishment, and have had the pleasure of visiting the works within the last year or two. The industry was founded about twelve years ago, but has only recently become established on a. sound footing. It carried on during the sions was on the verge of closing down. Despite what the Minister has said, the profits of the company have not been exorbitant. Only in the last couple of years, since the use of cement has greatly increased, has it been able to produce at a reasonably high capacity, and enable dividends to be paid. The Minister quoted its dividend payments as published in the Wild Cat Monthly, but confined his observations to preference shares. I am informed that the first dividend on ordinary shares was 2\ per cent. This was obtained in 1933, after which the dividend on ordinary capital was reduced from 20s. to 13s. 4d. In 1934, a 10 per cent, dividend was paid on a decreased capital, equivalent to 6^ per cent, on the original share value, whilst last year a special distribution was made to shareholders to compensate to some extent for the earlier years when no dividends were paid. Last year's total dividend was 2s. a share, equalling 15 per cent, on the written-down value or 10 per cent, on the original value. It is not considered that these dividends are at all excessive, although the Tariff Board reported that the prices were unduly high, but and that local manufacturers could compete with imported cement landed duty",25,Bitumen Natura L Materials Which Are So Much Easier To

Thus, to-day, the existing British preferential duty on cement is, by law, Is. per cwt. Article 10 of the Ottawa agreement provides-His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia undertake that, during the currency of this agreement, the tariff shall be based on the principle that protective duties in that respect? shall not exceed such a level as wiil give United Kingdom producers full opportunity of reasonable competition on the basis of the relative cost of economical and efficient production, provided that in the application of Mich principle .s|>ecial consideration may bo given to the case of industries not fully established.

Article 11. providesHis Majesty's Government in the COIIHIHIIIwca-lth of Australia undertake that a review shall be made as soon as practicable by the Australian Tariff Board of existing protective duties in accordance with the principles laid down in article 10 hereof, and that after the receipt of the report and recommendation of the Tariff Board the Commonwealth.

I , for one, protested against this because.

Another point to be considered is the board's interpretation of the Ottawa agreement authorizing it to of Australian manufacturers. If the British duty on cement is repealed, where is that marginal advantage for Australian companies? The Ottawa agreement makes no reference to the effect of exchange. It deals solely with the imposition of duties.

Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -This item, which was introduced some time ago, indicates that past governments believed that the industry could be carried tion. The industry has been established in every State of the Commonwealth. Because the article produced is heavy, transport charges are high, and, as a. result, there has been decentralization of manufacturing. Now we are told that the industry is over-capitalized, and that it should be re-organized on the basis of an output of 750,000 tons a year. If this happens, the smaller manufacturers in outlying districts of the various States are liable to be put out of business and production will be confined to the larger concerns in metropolitan areas. We know how that will affect the users of this commodity. In Queensland, for example, at the present time the larger users of cement in the vicinity of Brisbane are able to obtain it at perhaps a reasonable price, but the charge to users in the far-north of that State, by reason of railway transport costs, is much higher. If the Queensland industry goes out of existence then the users of cement in that State will have to pay the added cost of transport from the south, and possibly higher prices in addition. cement has to be brought 12,000 miles 111 GflSlfS Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -A t the present time heavy rail freight has to be paid to send cement from Brisbane to Cairns, a distance of 1,000 miles.

As the revenues of the country are not affected to any extent, honourable members are free on this item, as indeed, on all other tariff items, to vote as they think fit. My vote for the recommendation of the Tariff Board. It will be generally conceded that cement is an absolute necessity in our community life, and is used in connection with a large number of industries. on with effective protecConsequently, it assumes an importance of which the committee must take cognizance. There is no commodity the price of which has been more widely canvassed within recent years. If there is one commodity, the cost of which is generally believed to be too high, it is cement. The Tariff Board, having inquired into the industry, arrived at certain conclusions. The policy of that tribunal has always been to do nothing that might damage Australian industry. In this particular case the board stated in its first report that its proposal would not damage the industry. In a supplementary report, having reconsidered all the relevant facts, it repeated that averment. As the hoard is accepted in Australia and Great Britain as a fair and an impartial body for the investigation of tariff matters, I am prepared to accept its view on the evidence placed before it, and shall not change my attitude unless proof is adduced that its conclusions are wrongly based. Nothing has been said during this debate whicb has shaken in any way the statements made and arguments advanced by the board. On the contrary, reliable and substantial statements have been made, and arguments adduced which have proved indubitably that the facts are as stated by the board, and that the cost of cement to the Australian community is abnormally high. Not even those honourable members who may propose to vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) have denied that prices are unduly high; on the contrary they have admitted that for years the people of Australia have paid too much for their requirements of cement.

For the same reason, the cost of every building constructed of concrete is abnormally high. The burden does not rest solely on the manufacturer, who so far has been the only party referred to in this debate. I put it to honourable members that Parliament owes a duty to every user of cement. Consideration for the user can be shown only by the acceptance of the Tariff Board's report. I direct attention to a press cablegram of yesterday's date, which stated that Dr. Earie Page, speaking at a function in London, had appealed for an indication from Great Britain of its ability to take the whole of Australia's output of certain products, in which case Australia would be prepared to assure absolutely regular supplies. while asking Great Britain, through our ambassador, to take everything that we can export to that country, Great Britain must not be permitted to export to Australia one pound of cement.

This is the third year in which that agreementhas operated. So far there has been no breach of it; but if this amendment is carried, a clear and definite breach will he made in it. Honourable members may laugh at the suggestion that an honourable agreement is likely to be broken. I see nothing to laugh at. I am merely the necessity for taking notice of the probability of that Article. 10 of the Ottawa agreement stipulates that United Kingdom producers shall have full . opportunity of reasonable competition provides mountainous duties imposed by the Scullin Government. clearly provides that the Tariff Board shall be the authority to determine whether or not duties are competitive, and, if Parliament varies the duties 7'ecommended by the Tariff Board in the direction of increasing them, it commits a hreach of the Ottawa agreement. Thus, if the amendment now before the Mr Archdale Parkhill. Ottawa agreement will be committed. I place these facts before the committee, confident that time and the British Government will show that my interpretation is the correct one. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) was good enough to announce the other night, in grandiloquent terms, that his party proposes in the future, irrespective of what it has done in the past, to consider the interests of the consumers, as well as those of the manufacturers, when determining what duties it will support. will not be in order in proceeding along those lines. Apparently, Throughout the whole of this discussion there has been shown a tenderness and solicitude for the interests of the manufacturers which provide inescapable proof that the public are being blackmailed into paying excessive prices. I defy any one to say that the interests of the users of cement have been adequately considered, and when the vote I listened carefully to the is taken wo. shall see the so-called champions of the working class sitting side by side with the representatives of monopoly and privilege. seems to me that the Minister for Defence( Mr Parkhill), in a despairing effort to bolster up a weak case, has, as usual, resorted to misrepresentation.

It is with some trepidation that 1, as a mere layman, rise to answer a question propounded by a gentleman learned in the law, but it seems to me that the answer to his question is to be found in article 11 of the agreement. In article 10 these words occurHis Majesty's Government in the Commonbetween we have an umpire, the Tariff wealth of Australia, undertake that during the currency of this agreement the tariff shall Board, a body which has no axe to ho based on the principle that protective duties grind, and can be depended upon to shall not exceed such a level as will give speak with absolute impartiality.

In other words, we undertake that, gentlemen who are unable to accept the during the currency of the agreement, Tariff Board's report, on this matter. the principle shall be maintained of a competitive, rather than a prohibitive, In the manufacture of cement, we have tariff.

I did not Are we to understand that, while in article 10 we deliberately accept the principle of a competitive rather than a The Minister would prohibitive tariff, we shall so interpret article 11 as to decline when it suits us to give effect to that principle? It seems to me that if Parliament refuses to honour the principle embodied in article 10 it must necessarily commit a breach of the agreement. The Tariff Board has stated that 10s. a ton is, in its opinion, a reasonable profit, for the manufacturers of cement. Does any honourable member challenge that? The board has further Baid that, after allowing 6s. a ton for depreciation on machinery, the present average profit of ten of the companies engaged in the manufacture of cement is 24s. l i d . a ton. Ten shillings a ton profit is said to be a f a i r thing, but a profit of 24s l i d . a ton was made last year. We have, on one hand, the users of cement; they may be regarded as interested parties. On the other hand are the manufacturers of cement. They, too, may be regarded as interested parties.

I consider that the cases upon which the new protection doctrine was rejected so long ago have been definitely over-ruled by later decisions of community it should come to an end. the High Court, and it is competent for this Parliament to regulate both wages and prices in protected industries. Apart from that, this Parliament has power to tax profits. member suggest that we should legislate to control wages? we can, hy our own legislation, control wages. We can legislate without resort to the Arbitration Court at all, or we can prescribe general standards and leave it to the court or to seine other tribunal to up in the supplementary report of the apply them to particular cases. We cannot prescribe standards under the arbitral power, but we can under other power. That disposes of the objections to a protective duty on the score of wages, profits and prices. The cement industry is suitable to this community. To refuse it protection is to make its future uncertain. Even honourable members who are supporting the Government have prayed almost on their bended knees for an assurance from the Government that it can take action quickly enough to protect the industry from overseas dumping. given quickly enough. satisfied with the assurance. Excessive profits and excessive prices can be dealt with by legislation, but the most important consideration is that the people engaged in the industry, either as entrepreneurs or as employees, should feel that their future is fairly secure, and that duties on established industries should not be lightly reduced. If there is anything in the Ottawa agreement or in the Tariff Board's report contrary to that doctrine I do not accept either. If the Ottawa agreement prevents us from protect]ng established industries it is time it was ended. If Ave are to accept the Tariff Board's recommendations, without using our own judgment, it is time that, we went back to our own States and let officials do everything for us. if an industry has been proved by experience to be not suitable to this country, or parasitic on other industries, or an industry which does not use Australian raw materials in adequate quantities, or does not meet the needs of the But here we have no parasitic industry, but one which is entirely natural and suitable to Australian conditions. The only complaint is that entrepreneurs are making exorbitant profits. I assume that the companies are making excessive profits, but there are means of dealing with that evil. As I said recently, if the company is a pig, we can roast our pig without burning down our house. [3.11] I think the position with regard to this industry is fairly well summed Tariff Board, in which the industry has been accused of being over-capitalized, of rationing its output, and of making unreasonably high profits. It has been shown, that, on a 30 per cent, output, in the last five years, nine mills have made a profit of £2.250,000. The Tariff Board stated distinctly in its supplementary report that its recommendation was intended to force a drastic reduction of prices. We have heard about the fearf ul calamities that will happen if a little bit of cement is imported at lower prices than obtain in the United Kingdom, but I have not heard anything about the state of affairs in the United Kingdom to-day, where tens of thousands of tons of Australian sugar is put on the market at prices lower than the Australian prices; nothing about Australian butter, which is sold on the British market at a fraction of the price charged to the Australian consumer; and nothing about Australian wine, and dried fruits. If we are to take this dog-in-the-manger attitude, and declare that no country is to be allowed to send its goods here, except at prices which suit us, we can only expect that the producers in the United Kingdom will view with alarm the Australian exports of sugar, butter and other commodities, and will complain to the House of Commons of the position into which they are being forced by the attitude of the Commonwealth Parliament.

Notwithstanding that staggering blow, the Queensland banana industry is still functioning, and from outward appearances it has suffered nothing calamitous. has suffered. honourable gentleman is always complaining. He is a perpetual Jeremiah. The worse case in regard to the cement industry is in Queensland. The Queensland cement interests want a duty high enough to enable them to pay a freight of 19s, a ton on limestone to be manufactured into cement. Queensland get3 a fair amount out of the Commonwealth under present conditions, and it is just about time that its people recognized that. In my electorate is situated one of the big cement works, and I say with all my knowledge of the situation, that the Government is doing the right thing, and I trust that it will stand to its guns. other hand is marketed in locally-manuHonorable gentlemen who support this amendment have overlooked the fact that yearly we are spending thousands of pounds abroad on the purchase of bitumen for the making of roads which could be laid with cement produced There is no need to use for road work the high-quality cement that is used in other forms of engineering, but the cement industry has shown no indication of a desire to achieve commercial production of a cheap cement for road-making. They are quite prepared to keep the limited market they at present have for the local product has over the imported higher quality cement, and. to keep fastened on the community, the profits which they are at present enjoying on their inflated investment. The Tariff Board in its review of the price charged by one factory stated thatThis price reduced hy the whole costs of coal and limestone gives a figure which is more thorn twice tlie domestic price of cement in Only a few months the United Kingdom; in fact, the profit per ton alone exceeded the domestic price of cement in the United Kingdom. Luxuries of that description are a little too expensive for a country like Australia. We are in the habit of talking grandly about the great natural resources which we do not possess. It is about time that the members of the Commonwealth Parliament took serious stock of the natural resowees of Australia. If they did so, they would realize that industries which require such high protection as the honourable member for Moreton desires to afford the cement manufacturing industry, are babies which are too expensive for us to have about the premises. The( Sir Littleton Groom) had something to say about the possible centralization of the cement manufacturing industry in Sydney and Melbourne, and the resultant increased cost of cement sent to Queensland from those centres. Apparently he overlooked the fact that the cement produced in Great Britain, the competition of which he fears, would have to be transported 12,000 miles. Locally-made cement enjoys several advantages over the British article which is brought to Australia in barrels and has to be measured or weighed carefully before it can be used on the job. Australian cement on the factured bags. The making of concrete is a very fine art, and the materials have to be carefully weighed or measured. Contractors who use local cement know exactly how much they are getting in the containers in which it is delivered, wherein the Commonwealth. as those who use cement imported in barrels have to measure all the cement they use, which is an added cost to their operations. That should be taken into consideration by honourable gentlemen who are opposing the Government's -proposal for the free entry of cement from Great Britain. Another advantage that the article is the exchange rate. The Government does not propose to take away this advantage which is in itself substantial.

During the seven year period from 1927 to 1934, one large company did not pay any dividends, and last year a small dividend of 3d. a share only was declared. F u l l consideration should be given by the Tariff Board not only to Australian production costs but also to those of the earthenware industry abroad. Overseas manufacturers, however, invariably refuse to supply the board with detailed figures of costs of production. in a disadvantageous position. opposed to excessive profits, but when charges of profiteering are made in the interests of reputable industry they should be substantiated by authentic details. If we are to believe some of the charges made against Australian industries during the course of the tariff discussions, capital will be scared out of the country and much unemployment w ill result. During the last few years this industry has i m proved the national outlook by providing employment for a. number of workers. As long as the Tariff Board requires local manufacturers to supply figures relating to their production costs and does not insist on them in the case of overseas manufacturers, Australian industries w ill be at a disadvantage. If the board is to be a price-fixing authority, it should have before it all the facts. Sooner or later, judging the responsibilities of the Tariff Board will have to be defined. This industry has done everything possible to reduce the prices of its products, and I submit that a good case for a review of the duties has been made out. Progress reported. POI.ICINO ARBITRATION AWARDS. proposedThat the House do now adjourn. In my constituency, as in most industrial constituencies, there are many workers who are paid less than the legal wage. In the district of Bourke there are a number of manufacturers of clothing, not all of whom are respondents to the federal award. Allegations of sweating in the clothing trade have been made, and I am convinced that they are well founded. Difficulty arises, however, because there are no Commonwealth inspectors to police federal awards. about Mr Blakeley? f u l l y occupied in connection with awards covering journalists, bank and insurance clerks, and municipal employees. The matter has been complicated by the recent This places Australian industries decision of the H i g h Courti n the metal I am trades case. TheH i g h Court held that an enxployer who is a respondent to an award is bound in respect not only of the unionists employed by him, but also of his non-unionist employees; but it is doubtful if an individual employee can recover his wages unless he is a member of a union. A curious position has arisen in Victoria where the Factories Department has found that employers against whom it proposes to institute proceedings for paying less than the minimum wage fixed by the .State do not deny paying less than the minimum award fixed by the State authorities or by the A r b i tration Court, but claim that, as they are covered by the federal law, the State law has no hold over them. I urge the Commonwealth Government to exercise tlie powers vested in it by section 50A of the Arbitration Act, and hy the tariff discussions, confer on the factory inspectors of tbe State power to act as inspectors under the federal award. I also suggest that the Commonwealth should assist the Statesi n meeting the expense of such appointments. The Victorian Government has complained that it cannot enforce its laws because it has not sufficient inspectors to police them and cannot afford to appoint the necessary officers. As the enforcement of industrial laws is a condominium of State and Federal authorities the two should combine to carry out the work and meet the expense. If that were done, I am convinced that there would soon be no grounds for allegations of sweating in Victoria. The Government has power to make regulations under the Arbitration Act to provide for the posting of awards in the factories of respondents. There are some respondent manufacturers in whose factories no unionists are employed. In",36,Divisi On 8 Earthenware Cement

Consideration w ill be given to the quesI f the Government could tion of publishing a report of the activities of the Commonwealth Government in conjunction with the States in regard to Australian mining. 3. The following action has been taken by the Commonwealth Government to assist the mining industry:I . Assistance to Metalliferous MiningA sum of £543,750 has been made available£493,750 for the States and £50,000 SOT Commonwealth territories-to assist in the development of the metalliferous mining industry. The scheme w ill cover a period of a little more than three years, terminating on the 30th June, 1938. Assistance will be devoted to advances to companies or persons, The Government is preprovision of staff for State departments, prospecting, the provision of plants, metallurgical investigations, water supplies, roads and tracks, transport vehicles, and the education of miners. A conference of Ministers and technical officers, representing the Commonwealth and States, was held in Melbourne towards the end of last year for the purpose of reviewing the results of the scheme, which had then only been in existence for a matter of some few months. Information furnished at the conference indicated that, as a result of Commonwealth assistance, employment of a fairly permanent nature had been provided in the industry for an additional 0,000 men. The early effects of Commonwealth assistance for metalliferous mining are also reflected in the gold-production figures of the fourth quarter of 1935, which were 281,130 oz. fine, valued at £A.2,4fi2,474.
