In the face of considerable competition for training positions in two of the world’s most highly ranked children’s hospitals, he was appointed to the Hospital for Sick Children at Great Ormond Street in London and subsequently as senior registrar in paediatrics at the Hammersmith Hospital in London. In 1969, Simon Latham came to Australia, having been appointed senior lecturer at the Department of Child Health at the Brisbane Children’s Hospital, later to become the Royal Children’s Hospital. Dr Latham’s particular interest lay in paediatric gastroenterology, metabolic disease and endocrinology. His contributions to both undergraduate and postgraduate paediatric teaching were exceptional. He was a professional colleague and friend of Professor John Pearn, one of this country’s distinguished doctors, who later said of him that he was a man of natural compassion, empathy and warmth and someone who was an inspiration to all his students. His special contribution to Queensland medicine was that he was an innovator. Dr Latham’s interest in complete child care led inevitably to his advocacy for improved educational facilities for children with specific learning difficulties.
