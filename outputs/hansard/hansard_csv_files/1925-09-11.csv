11,Mr Marr,"I shall bring the honort EAGUE OE NATIONSASSEMBLY . Debate resumed from 14th August {vide page 1471), upon motion by Sir That the paper be printed I have read with keen interest the report of the Australian Delegation to the F if t h Assembly of the League of Nations and also the speeches delivered by the Attorney-General( Sir Littleton Groom) and thc Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) last month. I express my appreciation of the services rendered by those gentlemen, because I .know that the work at Geneva is strenuous and difficult. When thinking of the progress of the League of NationsI recall some remarks of the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) when addressing the Second Assemblyi n 1921. The right honourable gentleman said that it appeared to h i m that almost too much had been attempted during the past year. He went on to sayWe are at present in our infancy, and it appears to me we must walk slowly-dis creetly. Tbe great objective of the League of Nations, as I understand it, is to render war between the nations of the earth more difficult; the subsidiary objective is to endeavour io improve the general conditions of mankind throughout the world. With regard to the primary objective of rendering war more difficult, it seems to me that very little has been done. To-day tlie whole world desires peace, and the great difficulty about bringing about disarmament is that some of thc nations who desire peace as much as we do are without our portals. The position to-day is very much as it was in 1921; some of thc 'principal powers are still without the portals of the League. The Attorney-General, when presenting the report of the last delegation, saidI realize also that the reduction of armaments to be effective must be general; and thc United States of America and Germany must be parties to the agreement. We should consider the position of the other great English-speaking nation, and endeavour to facilitate its entrance into this arrangement. The Leader of the Opposition saidI am an admirer of the League of Nations. I am one who has always advocated it, but 1 can gee nothing but failure-for it if it is not handled differently. The honourable gentleman also said that as the League could not succeed because one or two powerful nations remained aloof from it, and the position was hopeless. He addedIt is a waste of money to try to forward the League of Nations so long as big nations remain outside it. I ventured the opinion in A p r i l, 1924, that the League's greatest disability was the non-inclusion of the United States of America and other powers. The Attorney-General stated that the most pressing question before the F if t h Assembly was the limitation of armaments, and be pointed out that from the very inception of the League that has been regarded as one of its most important problems. The result of the work of the League during the first four years of its existence towards its first and most important objective-the maintenance of world peacewas the draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance agreed to by the Fourth Assembly, and submitted for approval to the Governments of the countries which are memhers of thc League. As honourable members know, it was rejected. The Treaty of Mutual Assistance aimed at strengthening the provisions of article 16 of the Covenant of the League. That article providesShould any member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under Articles 12, 13 nr 15. it shall ipso facto be deemed to htivc committed an act of war aeainst all other members nf the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance nf all trade or financial relations, thc prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the cnvennnt-lvreaking State, and the prevention of all financial, ' commercial, or personal intercourse hetween the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a member of the League or not. It shall be the duty of the Council In such case to recommend to the several Governments concerned what effective -military, naval, or air force tbe members of the League shall severally contribute to thc armed forces tn be used to protect-the covenants of the League. The memhers of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another in the financial and economic measures which are taken under this article, in order to minimize the loss and inconvenience resulting from thc ahove measures, and that they will mutually support one another in resisting any special 'measures aimed at one of their number by the covenant-breaking State, and that they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of",12,Native Unrest In New Guinea

Other classes of disputes, which are regarded as not being suitable for arbitration, go to the Councilf o r investigation and report. There is thus no compulsorv arbitration under the Covenant of the League. chinery for sanctions into operation the authors of the Protocol have established the criterion, as it were, of an "" act of aggression.""

The underlying assumption of the Protocol is the same as that of the Treaty of Mutual Assistance, namely, that when States of mutual co-operation to operate in favour of any one of them that may be attacked they w ill be prepared to reduce their armaments. mitted that the Protocol definitely contemplates the assumption of some obligations, and the running of some attendant risks in the interests of world peace by States who seem themselves to be in a position of complete security. Addressing the Council meeting at Geneva in March last, Mr Austen Chamberlain pointed out that His Majesty's Government saw insuperable objections to signing then presented. out that the League, as then constituted, was not the League designed by the framers cf the Covenant. He said that it was never supposed that among the States not included in the League would be so many of the powerful nations of the world, and that least of all was it So far foreseen that one of those States would be the United States of America. It was his view that the economic sanction was entirely changed by the existence of powerful economic communities outside A t present, under the Covenant the League. He further pointed out that the Protocol suggested the idea that the vital business of the League was not so much to promote friendly co-operation and reasoned harmony in the management of international politics, as it was to preserve peace by organizing war, and possibly war on a large scale. In concluding his remarks he saidI n order to put the maSince the general provisions of the Covenant cannot be stiffened witli advantage, and since the ""extreme cases"" with which the Lea true may have to deal with probably affect nations or groups of nations more nearly than others. It is maintained in the His Majesty's Government conclude that the best way of dealing with the situation is, with the co-operation of the League, to supplement the Covenant, by making special arrangements in order to meet special needs. Thusi t would appear that to-day the Protocol is dead. The proposed security pact and the talk of similar pacts to be drawn up between some of the States of EuropeI f the Covenant indicate a leaning again towards one of the provisions of the d r a ft Treaty of Mutual Assistance, that of regional agreements within the general agreement. Soon, apparently, the position of the European States will be very much as it was prior to the war, with one great difthe ference, namely, the existence of the have organized a system League of Nations-which , to my mind, is a great influence towards the peaceful settlement of disputes-and the obligation of members of the League to publish to It is adthe world all pacts and agreements entered into by them. commitments under the Treaty of Versailles, from which is derived the structure of the League of Nations, must always be regarded as a non-party matter, inasmuch as they must continue no matter what party happens to be in ofiice in this Commonwealth. Thereand r a t if y in g the Protocol as fore, I approach this question in a He again pointed non-party spirit. I regret the marked apathy that is displayed in Australia in regard to foreign affairs and the trend of international politics. That apathy is not confined to the general public I am sorry to say that it is shown also by the press and by many of our public men. It may be considered presumptuous on my part to say so;",13,Littleto N Groom
13,Mr Coleman (Eeid) [11.23],"Ou rbut the great newspapers of Australia devote a considerable amount of their space to ill-considered and, in some instances, ignorant, criticism international commitments. the apathy of honourable of this Parliament our responsibilities under the League of Nations. I am speaking out heat or passion, and 1 hope that my criticism in this regard will be taken in the spirit in which it is tendered. This great Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, carrying as it does a tremendous burden of responsibility to this generation, and to generations to come, in regard to questions affecting the peace of the world and disarmament, can find time to discuss subjects of purely parochial consequence-as, for instance, tin* devotion of an entire day to the discussion of main road construction-and yet thrusts aside the discussion of matters relating to our commitments under the Treaty of Versailles and the Covenant of the League of Nations. cusses these questions to-day only as a result of repeated representations to the Government. Speaking again in a non-party spirit, I maintain that the Government is to be reproached for its failure to apprehend its responsibilities in this regard. The Fifth Assembly of the League of Nations met at Geneva in September of last year for the purpose of seeLeader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) ing if effect could be given to the fundamental principle upon which the' whole Covenant of the League is based, namely, security, disarmament, and arbitration. As a result, for the first time in history 44 nations, through their representatives, agreed to what is known as the "" Protocol for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes."" Leader( Mr Charlton""), who has always been unswerving in his. devotion to the cause of peace, returned to Australia in -December, and the other delegate ( Sir Littleton Groom) in January. But the Government did not think the matter of sufficient consequence to call Parliament together to consider it, and allowed it to remain in abeyance until a few weeks ago when the delegates submitted their report to Parliament. We are discussing it now because of persistent requests on my part, and on the part of the honourable members for Kooyong( Mr Latham) Mr Coleman. and North Sydney( Mr Hughes), and others. It is positively scandalous that the national parliament of Australia of our does not give adequate attention to I regret foreign relations. Let us contrast the members treatment accorded to this Parliament in regard ' to by the Government with that which has been extended to the Parliaments of withGreat Britain, Canada, and New Zealand by their respective Governments. The British Parliament discussed the Protocol at great length shortly after the British delegates returned from Geneva, and the Canadian and New Zealand Parliaments gave it very deliberate consideration. The Commonwealth Government, however, ignored this Parliament, and sent a dispatch to the British Government outlining various reasons why the Protocol should be condemned, but not suggesting any amendments. It thus contradicted the attitude of its two delegates to the Assembly of the League, and also to an extent pronouncements of the Prime Minister It dishimself. This action certainly showed a lamentable lack of sense of proportion, to say the least of it. I should like to direct attention to one or two other indications of the neglect of the Government in this matter, and of departures from a recently established practice. In a fit of political benevolence the Government saw fit to invite the to attend the F if t h Assembly of the League. mended by a representative of the Government at the previous Assembly. member is right. The Minister for DeOne of our delegates, my fence ( Sir Neville Howse), who was a nominee of the Government at the Fourth Assembly of the League, recommended that the Opposition also should be represented on future delegations. I regret that this course was not followed on the present occasion, because we should endeavour to free our delegations from that party spirit which necessarily characterizes most of the debates in this House. It is also essential chat we should strive for continuity of policy in regard to our commitments under the League. Some explanation of why the Government has abandoned the practice is necessary.

Are we not entitled to know what countries are defaulting, and to ask if they are really earnest members of the League or simply claiming paper membership with no intention of standing up to their financial obligations? I turn now to the Protocol and the security pact which arises out of it . very much regret the statement made by the honourable inember for Brisbane( Mr the March meeting of the Council of the D . Cameron) and by the press of this countiy that the Protocol is dead. People who.take that view imply that the League of Nations also is dead. case, because article 8 of the Covenant of the League statestlie maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments tn the lowest point consistent with national safety, and the enforcement, by common action, of international obligations. This crystallizes the prevailing sentiment that great armaments are dangerous to peace, not so much because of their size as of the tendency to increase them. Assembly after Assembly has been attempting to agree upon a basis for a formula to bring about peace that will lead to disarmament. and others who have studied the fundamental principles of the League will admit that this last document, the Protocol, represents an epoch-making event in the world's history. that, after thousands of years of warfare and international hatred, it has been possible for 44 nations of the world to gather at a conference table and accept an agreement calculated to provide for almost every contingency likely to lead to war. MrD . CAMERON -They also accepted the Treaty of Mutua l Assistance. ,'„Jtr. COLEMAN not received with the same general alcclamation -and enthusiasm by the various powers. The point I wish to make is that, by means of this ProAustralia contritocol, the various nations were within reasonable distance of agreement, and that it depended upon the attitude of Great Britain whether or not the Protocol would be ratified. Surely, in the circumstances, it would have been better if , inWhy is it that nearly onestead of rejecting the Protocol, the British Government and the Commonwealth Government had made some reservations or suggested amendments. Had that been done, the present Assembly of the League might have been able to take a reasonable consideration of the problem and reconcile the different views. Unfortunately, the Protocol was rejected, mainly at the instance of Great Britain. I I read with interest the speech delivered by Mr Austen Chamberlain at League. He there stated that in certain circumstances war might be a "" tragic necessity,"" and implied a doubt whether the signatory nations of the League would redeem their obligations under This must be the the Covenant. His speech was most depressing. In the words of Mr Ramsay MacDonald"" The moral leadership of Europe was Britain's finest asset. Mr. Chamberlain's speecli has wantonly thrown it away."" I cordially endorse Mr Ramsay MacDonald's statement. In Mr Austen Chamberlain's Declaration to the League Council, there was not a vestige of sympathy with the implied obligations of the British Government to the Covenant. will agree that no one has worked more The Prime Minister strenuously for European peace than Mr. Austen Chamberlain. in a moment.

No one can foretell the outcome of hostilities in Morocco at the present time. says that the Bolsheviks are causing all this trouble. with the right honourable gentleman in that regard. it is a serious matter to criticize the British Government, or, for that matter, the Government of any other country concerning its attitude towards its commitments under the League; but I say that the philosophy of British toryism, as represented by Conservative governments in the Mother Country, the imperialistic trend of foreign policy, and the desire for economic expansion in I r a k hope that the day is not far distant when and Mosul, as well as in other countries, have apparently been responsible for an understanding with France, under which the latter country is to have a free hand in Morocco, and Britain a free hand in Mosul. It is obvious that the forces of secret diplomacy are at work within the ranks of the respective governments. By the silence of the Great Powers of Europe on these great issues, and by the invasion of Morocco by France, they have virtually set aside the Council of the League. Because of these developments I am pessimistic about the future of the League, though I recognize that the reconciliation of European differences by the Leaguei n regard to customs, water-ways, and in various other directions, is no mean achievement. has accomplished immeasurable good, but especially in regard to Egypt, Corfu, Silesia, and other countries. These mistakes bave been strongly criticized by opponents of the League. However, in spite of all this, I wish the League to continue, because I believe that even in its consultative form it is capable of enormously benefiting mankind. It has brought the nations together. In this respect it has done, in the international world, what conferences do in the industrial world. People who indulge in captious criticism of the League might just as logically criticize conferences in connection with social activities in Australia, where nothing of a tangible nature may be accomplished, and yet, undoubtedly, a great deal of good may be done by the interchange of opinions. That is the surest way to remove prejudice and create understanding. I believe that the League of Nations will never be able to function effectively so far as disarmament and the world's peace is concerned whilst it is dominated by capitalistic nations, because their obI recognize that jective is economic development and expansion, and the active prosecution of this objective is, according to the views of modern publicists and jurists, one of the principal causes of war.

America was able to affirm the notwithstanding Monroe doctrine, in consequence of her isolation, and she has been able to maintain it in these times because of her enormous economic strength, wealth, and population. America's situation and her mixture of populations have rendered it desirable to follow the foreign policy laid down by Washington, and affirmed by the presiWe candents who have succeeded him.

Therefore, the League, if it is to continus, must accept its present, jurisdiction. is uo small thing to say that all the other nations of importance, with the exception of the three I have mentioned, are within the League. If the situation is wisely handled there is no reason why German delegates should not contribute to the deliberations of the' League. I have expressed these opinions to define my the Australian commitments under the Covenant, because the subject bas never been adequately considered and dealt with so far as I have been able to ascertain. From a material stand-point, disarmament will beip us. press is creating a Japanese scare, and we are talking of building up armaments, armaments such as Australia, with its limited population, is hardly able to provide for. Our chief need is economic development, population as we can absorb our tries. Increased population w ill enable us to hold this country more effectively than costly fortifications and -cruisers, and to that extent we need the help of the Leaguei n bringing about disarmament,' because w it h disarmament will come the relief of security. Australia has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, by disarmament if territorial jurisdiction as to immigration is respected; and if we are not entangled in further European wars, Australia will be able to expand and develop her industries and increase her population. I believe, as I have definitely stated before, we should continue to be represented in the Assembly of the League of Nations, and that we should recognize our obligations under the Covenant. There has been a good deal of criticism concerning the Protocol, much of which has been ill-informed. Even under present limitations we can use the structure of the League to destroy tbe suspicion that exists in the minds of . a section of our people, particularly in regard to Pacific questions. If we cannot have the Protocol, which is a worldwide document, surely we should seekand I make this suggestion to the Government in all seriousness-throug h the League of Nations or through the British Government, or by direct communication with the United States of lt America, a Pacific disarmament conference, which would eliminate for all time our unfounded suspicions in regard to the possibility of Japanese aggression.

We should long Labour party in rehition to ago have had a resolution of this Parliament. As a result of the Washington Disarmament Conference of -1921, limitations were imposed on the construction of capital ships, but-now there is feverish competition between the United States To-day the of America and Japan in cruiser construction. The Washington Treaty provides that each of the signatories shall respect the territorial integrity of the other. The principle of a limitation in the number of capital ships was affirmed, but questions of domestic jurisit, and the building up of diction were specifically reserved and primary and secondary indusexcluded from the terms of this pact. The very question which is causing panic in the minds of many people to-day was excluded. Every effort should be made to convene a further conference, and, if this Government will not act, the party represented by honourable members on this side of the chamber will endeavour to obtain one. A t such a conference an effort could be made to settle the vexed question of domestic jurisdiction. I agree with the opinion so ably expressed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Charlton) and the Attorney-General( Sir Littleton Groom) that immigration is a matter of domestic jurisdiction, but, from an understanding with Japan aud other nations whose interests are in the Pacific, much good would result. Any one who has given the position of Japan any consideration will agree that the real conflict in the Pacific, if there is to be one, w ill be in regard to concessions in China. We are told that the recent riots in that country were the result of Russian propaganda.

Dealing with the Russian situation, and with the Far East, he makes these very pregnant and important remarks : Tlie real danger from Eussia will be due to her fanning the flames of discontent and revolt that exist in oppressed classes and nationalities in East Europe and throughout the Near Middle and Ear East. The real defence, therefore, is an enlightened social and economic policy, and the granting of autonomy, &c, by East European nations and States with discontented imperial possessions. We are told that bolshevik propaganda is responsible for the uprising in China today. When one reads the' Contemporary Review or other writings that are accepted as impartial criticism of British policy, one finds that the troubles China are due to the aspirations of the Chinese for self-government economic emancipation from child slavery, women slavery, and low wages. powers of the world, instead of allowing their capitalistic greed to dictate policy in China and elsewhere, set about the rehabilitation would be less danger than exists to-day of a clash in the Pacific. about Japan If there is to be any war in the Pacific, it is more likelv to take place between Japan and the TJnited States of America between Japan and any other country. have consulted many authorities on international law, such as Professor delegates to the Assembly of the League of Nations, and others. They have clearly pointed out that Japan accepts the principle that immigration domestic jurisdiction. She acts on that principle in excluding from Japan. regards immigration mestic jurisdiction, Poland to expel large numbers of Germans. This principle, therefore, has been fairly established. The COUTC .1 of the League of Nations and the Court affirmed it. But Japan has insisted upon certain reservations being included in the Protocol, and also in the Covenant of the League originally, to the policy of the TJnited States in regard to her nationals who are resident there. Only a year or so ago, by a decision of the Supreme Court of the TJnited States of America, Japanese were placed Mr Coleman. on the same level as negroes and undesirable aliens, and they were forthwith dispossessed of their landed rights in California. Without warning, thousands of them-fruit-grower s and others-were dispossessed of their properties, as ineligible to hold land in fee-simple. The result was that the Japanese had to throw their properties on the market. There was a g l u t; they had to sell out at a loss; and generally they were badly treated. That caused strained relations between Japan and the United States of America; but if the United States had been more tactful, the friction could have been obviated. U n for t unately, the ill feeling then caused exists to-day. In diplomatic communications foreign with Japan, the President of the United in States of America endeavoured to smooth the matter over by implying regret at the and undiplomatic action of the American Congress and the Californian legislature. If the One word more about domestic jurisdiction regarding immigration.

30,Mr Coleman,"I understand thatalthough it has been functioning for some years. of the League who hold mandates are bound to submit certain disputes to the International Court of Justice. we were to discriminate against labour, under the labour Treaty of Versailles, Japan or any other court and question our discrimination. Our commitments under the Covenant and under the treaty are very extensive, and are not to be lightly regarded. The criticism against the Protocol in regard to immigration is quite without foundation. In further proof of this statement, I could quote authorities that have been referred to in this debate, such as Sir Cecil Hurst, and the distinct reservations implied in the speeches of delegates at the Assembly of thc League when the Protocol was discussed. The Japanese attitude has been largely influenced by the hostility of the TJnited States of America, and way in which the American objectioas have been voiced. It is interesting to know that 35 States, including .Australia, ratified the Protocol establishing the Permanent Court of International Justice, and that twenty small States accepted the optional clause giving the court compulsory jurisdiction. A striking indication of the change in the moral outlook of Europe is afforded by the fact that of those twenty. States, many are situate! in the Balkan area, which, before the war, was regarded as a powder magazine. I now desire to refer briefly to the European Security Pact. We find that the British Government' is discussing a regional understanding, to be known as the European Security Pact, between Germany, France, and herself. These discussions were instituted as a result of diplomatic exchanges initiated by Germany with France. is no concern of ours; it is purely a European document. Protocol was a world document. would have given Australia a measure > f % security, because we should have been parties to it , and could have looked for assistance from the members of the League. But the pact is purely a European arrangement, and I say emphatically that we ought not to be a party to it. do not think that any of the dominions will be signatories to it . Herbert Spender, who is an authority on British The signatories to the Covenaut imperial policy, points out that the spirit of the Australian Labour policy of declining to participate in future wars overIf seas, except after a decision of the people, exists in the hearts of the Canadians and charter of the of the people of other dominions. We dominions cannot, in view of the country could go to . that scantiness of our population and our heavy economic liabilities, lightly accent European responsibilities. Our attitude in that regard is perfectly honest and honourable. Why should we be dragged into a war with Turkey, for instance, or be embroiled in some other localized war in Europe, which might be the result of a clash due to racial or capitalistic prejudice ? If Great Britain wants the security pact, let her give the guarantees. If she so chooses, it is her own concern. The only criticism I cffer is that Britain has agreed to secure Germany against France or France against Germany, but no nation is to secure the undiplomatic Britain against either of those or any other powers. These pacts are in rhe nature of the secret pre-war alliances, and; owing to their limited scope, and the secrecy of the discussions that characterize their formation, they will tend to create a great pan-Asiatic combination between Germany, Russia, China, and Japan. If there is to be a world peril, it will be a direct outcome of the short-sightedness of the European diplomats in their treatment of Germany and other losers in the late war. in allowing such a combination to develop. If world-disarmament has failed-and it seems to have done so temporarily, owing to the rejection of the Protocol-w e must evolve some other method of securing world peace. Sof a r as Europe is concerned, security, arbitration, and disarmament comprise the only formula by which the desired This security pact result can be achieved. France entertains fears of ultimate German economic and The Peace physical superiority, based on numbers It and v i r i l it y , and France is dependent today on a conscript army of many thousands of blacks.

Therefore, disarmament is a growing problem, and we find For the reason that I have stated, I that the French and some other nation? w ill not discuss it unless they can lie guaranteed security. given only by means of international guarantees. For the settlement of disputes they contend that they must have some substitute for war, and they are prepared to accept arbitration. The attitude of France up to the present time has been insincere in the view of many critics. Whenever there has been an attempt to bring about disarmament, France has been the first to offer her signature, but by her policy to-day she is an enemy to world peace. Her great army of blacks, her squadrons of aeroplanes, her militarist policy in Morocco, aud the whole of her actions make her, if anything, a possible enemy to humanity, unless the nations of the world are prepared to keep her to her Btated undertakings, and induce her to enter into some pact or arrangement. of Francei n that way; it is the ruling classes in France. interjection. contention that the advance of democracy is the only force that can prevent future war. Premier of France, conferred with the Labour Prime Minister of GreatB r it a in ( Mr Ramsay MacDonald), they had no interests in overseas investments in Mesopotamia or anywhere else. They met at a conference table, actuated by a sincere desire to achieve peace, and they laid the foundations for the Peace Protocol. It was the mental attitude towards war that brought the Protocol into being. When Mr Ramsay MacDonald was defeated at the British elections, what was the repercussion in Germany? She saw a change in the moral attitude of Great Britain, and immediately elected H in denburg by way of answer to the BaldwinChamberlain challenge. In France there now is an anaemic, compromise government with possibly militarist ambitions, a government that is not socialistic by anv stretch of the imagination. confirms my view that the only hope of peace is the triumph of democracy. I took that view when 60,000 of our soldiers, as the result of the brutal necessity of capitalist imperialisms, were crucified on the cross of militarism. Surely that sacrifice should make us work earnestly in the cause of peace! Security can be with, the anguish and pain of the last great war, and yet we have people in our midst who talk of war as a "" tragic necessity."" Such talk is an insult to the civilized intelligence of mankind, to the tenets of Christianity, and to the growing impulse in the hearts of the democracies of the world. The attitude of the nations towards disarmament and peace is assisting Russian propaganda, because if there is another war, nothing is more sure than that the resentment of the masses will be so great that a wave of militant communism will pass over Europe. Every man who has studied the subject will agree with that statement, and prominent writers admit that that will be the ultimate result. The powers of Europe have a tremendous responsibility in this regard. And what is our responsibility-w e of thedemocracy? Remembering that GreatI t is not f a i r to speak B r it a in spent £9,000,000,000 during the war, and that 10,000,000 lives were sacrificed in that holocaust, is it not an insult I am glad of that to the men who died that the nations are It supports my original now quarrelling about concessions in oil, coal, and iron ?

It defines them, and makes our commitments in. regard to economic sanctions lighter, because it qualifies them by saying, "" Withdue regard to geographical situation inrelation to armaments.""

I join with other honourable members in regretting that this important discussion is taking place so late in the session. This is the l l t h September, 1925, and we are discussing the report of the Australian delegates to the Assembly of the League of Nations, which met in the beginning of September, 1924. That report bears the date, 15th January, 1925, and it was presented to this House, and ordered to be printed in June of this year. Now, in September, when the Assembly of the League.is again sitting, and when we are again represented in Geneva, we have our first opportunity of expressing views on the important matters which w ill be under consideration. I venture to suggest to the Government that, in f a i l in g to provide earlier facilities for this debate, it has failed to recognize the responsibility it owes to Australia and the League. merited protest. League is of very great importance to Australia, both directly and indirectly. Of course, a gneat deal of the work of the League is concerned with European questions, but it is wrong to assume that Australia has no interest in the solution of sueh problems. Great War arose out of a distinctly and essentially European question, but it nevertheless involved the whole world. Accordingly, the work of the League, in reducing points of friction in Europe, is of great importance to Australia and to the whole world. Before speaking of the Protocol and allied matters, I wish to refer to the thirty-fourth meeting of the Council of the Leaguei n June last, by way of illustration, as a means of indicating the current work of the Leaguef r o m week to week, and month to month, and in order that honourable members may. have some idea of its ordinary every-day work. selected June because that is the last month for which I have the official report, and I am merely proposing to cite some of the matters which were then dealt with. First, the Council had to consider the reconstruction schemes in Austria and Hungary. Reports from those countries were very good, and arrangements were made for in creasing salaries and for the electrification of the railways. H a d it not been for the work of the Leaguei t must be .accepted as a practical certainty that Austria would have fallen into desolation, and national decay, and that a disease of that kind would have spread over a very much larger area than Austria herself. In saving Austria the League has deserved well of the world. Vienna, instead of being a capital city of a country containing a large population, found itself after peace had been declared with a population of about 2,000,000 in a country containing only another 4,000,000. The AustrianC i v il .Service was necessarily concentrated in Vienna. It will be readily understood that as Austria became a much smaller country in consequence of the post-war settlement, she did not need anything like such a large civil service as formerly. One of the condiis a welltions under which the League of Nations assumed control of Austria was that her The work of the civil service should be reduced in accordance with a particular scheme. Since October, 1923, it has been reduced by 74,000 officers. It required a good deal of courage to dismiss that number of civil servants. A Government would consider the matter for a long while beAs we all know, the fore it would take such an action as that. Notwithstanding that courageous stand by the League, there is less unemployment in Austria to-day than when it assumed control of Austrian affairs, The currency of the country has been stabilized, and once again Austrians have some f a it h in the future of their country. The successful issue of the League's work in Austria led Hungary to make application to it to assume control of her finances. The operations of the League in Austria and Hungary have undoubtedly been of the greatest importance not only to Europe, but to the whole world. To illustrate the wide scope of the League's activities, I . s h a l l I refer to several other matters dealt with at the June meeting of the Council. It dealt w i th the subjects of double taxation and the evasion of payment of",25,Littleto N Groom

I remember that, on one occasion, some years ago, in the course of my professional work, I was called upon to advise a client who had to pay taxation at the rate of 22s. 6d. in the f l on his income in a given yeai\ He had a very big income, but he would have been f a r better off had it been only one-twentieth as large. rate after the adjustment of the exchange rates ? tive of exchange. various countries, and his income was taxed on different bases. It w ill be realized, therefore, that an standing of the taxation methods of various countries is of considerable importance. The June meeting of the Council also dealt w it h the treatment in European countries of various nationals, and a number of questions which affected minorities in different parts of Europe. Among Lithuania; some Hungarians, certain Transylvanians who complained that they had not been f a i r l y treated in Roumania, Slav minorities in Greece, Greek minorities in Turkey, and Turkish minorities in Greece. the League, no means existed of alleviating the distress of minority nationals, and many almost inextricable difficulties arose. Sometimes such matters involved serious national issues. The League has been able' to settle many of these amicably. The same meeting of the Council considered the means to be provided for making investigation into the armaments of Germany, Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria. consequence of the cessation of the control previously exercised under the provisions of the Peace Treaty. Questions affecting Danzig and the Ruhr Valley received attention. The Council also dispatched a commissioner to inquire into sleeping sickness in Africa, defined a programme of child welfare work, and appointed a commission to investigate road traffic problems and transportation matters generally. look at the present map of Europe will It may be thought that they show that there must be numerous transportation difficulties, for both travellers and merchandise have to cross the fron tiers of many countries within comparatively short distances. In a journey equal to that from Melbourne to Brisbane, for instance, it might be necessary to cross half a dozen international boundaries. The League is doing fine service in alleviating {passport complications, and in eliminating unnecessary customs formalities. I have referred to these matters simply to indicate that its work is not H a d he to pay at that confined to a meeting of the Assembly annually in September, but is going on all through the year. T h a t was irrespecThe continuance of the League is He had interests in of the greatest importance to Australia, for the particular reason that the system of mandates over terriundertories in the Pacific Ocean is dependent upon its permanence. Japan has mandates over 700 islands-mos t of them small-in the Pacific, and Australia has mandates over former German New Guinea and Nauru Island. W it h in the areas held under mandate from the League of Nations there can be no fortificathese were minorities in tions or naval or military bases. The perpetuation of the mandate system, therefore, will mean that to a large extent the Pacific Ocean will be perpetually denavalized and demilitarized. This is of the greatest possible protection to AusPrior to the establishment of tralia. Apart altogether from the idealistic sentiments that gather around the League, Australia thus has a very substantial and positive reason for supporting it . If the League should f a i l , the mandatory system must also necessarily fail. That would inevitably mean that the powers now responsible for the control of the mandated territories would annex them. In the case of Australia, that, would mean a new frontier. At present there is a gap of some 4,000 miles This was necessary in between our frontier and that of one of our near neighbours. As the League of Nations is responsible for this very desirable state of affairs, its maintenance is of supreme importance to Australia from the defence point of view. The expenditure of £250,000 that Australia has incurred in maintaining her membership of the League and in sending her representative to its various Assemblies at Geneva, is altogether insignificant comA more or less casual pared with the advantages that she derives from her association with it .",26,Littleto N Groom

A unanimous recommendation of such a body would have very great weight, and it would require very extraordinary circumstances to justify any State attempting to stand up against it . In any State there would be a considerable number of people who would objectto their State acting against a recommendation so powerfully supported. It must be evident that an award arrived at by a majority of arbitrators could not have the same weight, and could not affect the mind of the world to the same degree, as would the unanimous recommendation of the council.

It is recognized that it is more important to have order and certainty than to have theoretical perfection. When arbitrators make their own laws, they are apt to get into trouble. We have seen something very like that respecting industrial arbitration, because Parliament has done very little in the way of laying down principles according to which an arbitrator may work. In many cases of international jurisdiction there would be no generally accepted principles at all according to which the arbitrators could work or could be expected to work, and, therefore, before international jurisdiction can be universally apral agreement upon rules of international law.

Paragraph 8 contains this important provisionI f the dispute between the parties is claimed by one of them, and is found by the council to arise out of a matter which by international law is solely within the domestic jurisdiction of that party,' the council shall so report, and shall make no recommendation as to its settlement. This paragraph is of great importance to Australia. looked at in a very superficial manner, and that many Australians consider that, as Australia is a party to the Covenant, they can disagree with other nations on any matter of domestic jurisdiction ancl still enjoy the protection of the League of Nations. the paragraph to discover its precise meaning. The phrase "" a matter which by international law is solely w it h in the domestic jurisdiction of a p a r t v "" is in itself It did not exist in international law before the signature of the Covenant. It appears to be universally agreed that immigration is a matter which by international law falls solely within domestic jurisdiction. It is sometimes said that if a matter out of which a dispute arises is within the domestic jurisdiction of a State, any war on that matter must necessarily be wrong, and be an international crime. I should like honorafele members to consider the position for a moment. We all know that wars frequently arise out of the treatment in a foreign country of nationals of one of the belligerents. House that one circumstance which brought about the Boer war was the treatment of the Outlanders in the Transvaal. I do not wish to discuss the theory that all wars are brought about by economic causes and because men want money. Men want money and other things as well, and it is the other things as well as economic causes that bring about war. There is no doubt that the f r a nchise and legislation for a poll tax are essentially domestic matters. within the power of the Australian legislature to impose a poll tax on certain nationals, and our courts would uphold such an action. recognizes that we have power to do Mr Latlwim. that, and yet it might be most unjust Article and might well afford proper ground of protest to some other nation. What would happen if we were to provide that every national belonging to a self-conscious, active and powerful power, and engaged in any work in our country, say, in a factory, should be subjected to inspection, and should obey certain rules as to hours of work which applied to the nationals of no other country? That has been done in the case of one country, and is a matter of It appears to me that it is domestic jurisdiction; our right to do it has not been challenged. It is for us to say what factory laws we shall make; but are we going to contend that this well-armed, active, and powerful nation would have no right to object to such action, and that it could not possibly be I shall analyze a just cause for war ? this country would not justify any other nation in going to war with us. problem is not so simple and easy as the honourable member suggests. What would we do if our own nationals were treated in the same way in a foreign country? A simple and easy solution would not apply in the case of the Germansi n Poland, to whom reference has been made, or to the Poles in Germany. One only has to look at an ethnographical map of Europe to ascertain that many domestic questions have an important international bearing. That is the point that I wish to make. I am hot going to say that the passing of domestic legisLet me remind the lation would necessarily be a cause for war. I am pointing out that these matters are likelv to cause war.

There may not be a unanimous decision in favour of our contention that a particular matter is one of domestic jurisdiction. existence of the British veto if Great Britainwere to sit, has no bearing on this aspect of the matter. If there is any protection under paragraph 8 of article 15 it is afforded by a unanimous affirmative finding. It is obvious that the existence of a veto by one power does not help to bring about a unanimous affirmative finding, so that the British veto has no bearing on the matter, ' if , indeed, such a veto exists, and I have suggested that it does not exist. The main point I make is that while we might successfully raise the plea of domestic jurisdiction, if there is no recommendation made by the Council, there is nothing to restrict members, of the Leaguef r o m undertaking warlike operations. Under article 11 any war or threat of war is declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall 'take any action which may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of the nations. Under that any decision would again have to be unanimous. This is regarded as a conciliatory provision. It is distinct from article 15 which, by way o a f recommendation of the Council, imposes obligations upon the parties. article 11 no obligations are imposed upon the parties according to the ordinary interpretation of thearticles. It is directed to conciliating the parties where the Council is not in a position to i m pose obligations upon them by virtue of article 15. This matter of domestic jurisdiction was much discussed when the Protocol was under consideration, and in the report of the First Committee the chairman of the committee expressed a very important opinion. The report was adopted by the Assembly of the League. Of course, we all know that it was adopted at the end of the session, in circumstances of some haste, and perhaps it is not proper to hold all the representatives who were present to a complete acceptance of anything said in the report. article 15 the report saysThe provisions of the Protocol in nn wav infringe the principle, which remains unshaken, that a war undertaken against a State whose exclusive jurisdiction has been formally recognized, is an international crime to be avenged collectively by the signatories to the Protocol. The That has been the general view of the meaning of the Covenant. A decision upon a question of local power, that is to say, in regard to a dispute arising out of a matter of domestic jurisdiction, has been thought to determine the justice of the case, and it has been thought that a war undertaken against a State whose exclusive jurisdiction has been formally recognized is an international crime. But upon examination of the Covenant, we find that it does not say so, and, indeed, it could hardly say so, having regard to the fact that the question of whether a matter is or is not domestic is a purely legal one which may have nothing at all to do with the justice or merits of the dispute. Accordingly, Australia cannot safely rely upon the opinion in this d r a ft report that a decision upon a legal question means that the nation in whose favour it has been given is necessarily right in any dispute that has arisen out <>f the manner in which that nation has chosen to exercise its domestic power. The Protocol sought to amend certain gaps or fissures in the Covenant; the most obvious is in article 15, paragraph 7, by which, in the absence of a unanimous decision by the Council, the parties are free to "" take such action as they shall consider necessary for the maintenance of Under right and justice."" The Protocol seeks to amend that provision by making it possible for the Council to enforce arbitration in every instance. In regard to sanctions, and the question of domestic jurisdiction also, a certain tightening up of procedure has been attempted. In substance the Protocol provides for universal compulsory arbitration in all international disputes. The Covenant reqirres that a dispute must be submitted to either the Court, arbitrators, or the Council; but inquiry by the Council, which is the only procedure to which the parties can be forced by the Covenant, according to its terms, might be resultless by reason of the fact that a unanimous decision could not be reached. The Protocol, therefore, nrovides that if the Council is unable to reach a unanimous decision, it shall endeavour to persuade the Dealing with paragraph 8 of parties to arbitrate. If they agree to that . course, they are bound by rhe award of the arbitrator; if they do not agree to arbitrate, either party has the right to insist on arbitration, and if neither into agree upon arbitration, the stating of sists, the Council may enforce arbitration the issue would devolve upon the Council, by appointing arbitrators and submitting and the mere determination of the matter the case to them. That is the main proto be submitted to arbitration might go vision of the Protocol. We all desire to a long way to decide the issue itself. We support any system which would offer could have a referendum on almost anysome prospect of the prevention of thing if we could agree as to the question aggressive wars, or risk of any war at all, but this system does not sufficiently recognize the realities of the case.

I am in substantial agreement with what has been said by the Attorney General and the Leader of the Opposition regarding the effect of the Protocol upon matters of domestic jurisdiction. In that respect the Protocol has been almost completely misunderstood in Australia, and criticized from a wrong point of view. Australia, in this respect, has not been disadvantageously affected by tha Protocol; in so f a r as it is affected at all, it is affected advantageously, because the Protocol entitles Australia to obtain from the court a decision on the legal question of domestic jurisdiction, instead of leaving that matter to be determined by the diplomatists on the Council of the League. Accordingly I agree with what has been said as to the effect of those provisions in relation to domestic jurisdiction.

Canada, having stated its objections to the Protocol, proceeded to sayThat as Canada believes firmly in the subI mission of international disputes to joint inquiry or arbitration, and has shared in certain any notable undertakings in tliis field, we would be Accordprepared to consider acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of tlie Permanent Court in when justiciable disputes with certain reservations. considered, does not weaken That would have been a proper course The for our Government to take. There are disputes of a legal nature, such as those unfortunate I have already referred to, where there of suspicion, which is to be is a standard obligation which has already been recognized-interpretation s of treaties, damages for breaches of treaties, and such like-and it appears to me that Australia might very well discussion at Geneva, . were, have tried to persuade the Empire to most misleading. agree to refer disputes of that class to the is. very unfortunate that they decision of the Permanent Court of In not more accurately represent ternational .Justice. Reservations could have been made, but I think it would have been advisable to do it for the whole of the Empire. I am not suggesting that communicating Australia should have acted independently in this matter. .Various difficulties of a practical nature might arise which it is better to avoid if possible. Then the Canadian communication proceeded to state that Canada was preparedof those To consider methods of supplementing the subjects. provisions of the Covenant for settlement of non-justici'ible issues, including the method of joint investigation, reserving ultimate decisions in domestic issues and without undertaking further obligations to enforce decisions in the are specially preserved in case of other States. is in It. appears to me that that was also a I have already useful contribution. It is desirable to the protection which is have a f u l l international inquiry into disputes in order to avoid misunderstandings and misapprehensions of one kind or another. Eveni f the nations do not bind themselves to accept the decisions of the inquiring body it is all to the general good to have an inquiry into every case, and as full an inquiry as possible. It may be that if that line of action were examined and extended it would be possible to add certain other classes of disputes to those in regard to which an arbitration agreement might be made. Finally, Canada saidThat Canada would be prepared to take part in any general conference on reduction of iiriniiinents which did not involve prior acceptance of Protocol. I should have been better pleased if the Commonwealth Government had made a definite statement that it was prepared to take part in a conference for a reduction of armaments. As I have already said, disarmament is an"" age-long problem. It will not be solved in a few days or a few years. But every opportunity should be taken to explore all the possibilities of its solution. Eveni f our Government was not able to accept the ProtocolI think it had sound reasons for not doing so, since it is not a good thing to put one's signature to a thing with which one is not satisfied or which one is not prepared to carry out in substance and in spiritit might very well have said, "" L e t a Disarmament Conference take place if possible."" said, "" We w ill not take part in a Disarmament Conference until the Protocol is accepted,"" it. would have been their responsibility. But our Government might at least have gone as f a r as that. Finally, it appears to me that it would be well for Australia to consider more f u l l y its whole attitude towards the Covenant of the League of Nations, in order that all the obligations we assume under it may be fully realized by the Australian people. Here, again, I refer to the Canadian attitude. Honourable members are aware that article 10 of the Covenant provides that the members of the League undertake to respect and preserve, as against external aggression, the existing political independence and territorial integrity of the members of the League. That means a guarantee of all existing frontiers, and an obligation to fight in their defence. Canada has objected to that obligation, and has said that it is unreal. One cannot help thinking that it is unreal so far as Australia is concerned. Do the people of Australia really mean to say that they are prepared to defend the frontiers of Lithuania, Esthonia, or F in land? the difficulties attaching to geographical situation. for my inability to accept the Protocol. I am now pointing out that it is useless to undertake unreal obligations. Many of the nations feel that the obligations under article 10 of the Covenant are unreal, and that they are not really meant. To my mind, it is f a r better to make what you set down on paper correspond with your real intentions. The League of Nations can do most valuable and useful work in the world without pretending to do more than is possible. Yet article 10 attempts to do the impossible, and, therefore, Australia might very well have associated itself with the activities of Canada in seeking the amendment or repeal of that article. already done so. The matter has come up at the meeting of the Assembly of the League time and again, and every effort has been made to alter article 10 Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -And a general Then, if the other nations had interpretation of the obligations it i m poses has been given. the amendment proposed by Canada has apparently sunk into a condition of quiescence, and I am suggesting more energetic action on the part of Australia in that respect. One of the most important, developments of the League of Nations recently has been in the examination and definition of international law. Until we obtain a general consensus of the world upon the large principles of international law, it will be impossible to set up a general arbitration system. There would be no accepted principles to be applied by the arbitrators in the settlement of disputes, and disputes could only be settled according to what tbe -irbitrators thought to be a f a i r thing. In otlier words, there would be no principles of law which the arbitrators could apply. Accordingly, the activities of Uie League should be directed to a fuller definition a i d codification of the principles of international law and to",35,Littleto N Groom

To a certain extent that is true. As I indicated in a cable message from London last year, the Protocol has its good and its bad points, and anything I may say here to-day is in confirmation of the views I expressed in the cable. I agree with the action taken by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) in voting against a proposal to remove certain activities of the Council of the League to Paris, Rome, or elsewhere in Europe. Undoubtedly it should work in a neutral atmosphere, and where the Assembly holds its meetings. I also agree with him that in matters of give Australia a better sense of security. As the honourable member for Kooyong has and repreProtocol, especially in so far as it affects",37,Littleto N Groom

Failurei n respect of any one of these three conditions meant the death of the Protocol, so it really seems as if it was never intended that the Protocol should be ratified by the Powers, but that it was, as I have said, a ""feeler"" to indicate what the Powers concerned thought about disarmament. A curious and dangerous departure appears to have Deen made Dy encouraging majority instead of unanimous decisions in respect of matters of grave importance, such as are covered by articles 4, 7, and 10. Under article 10 it is possible for a State to be deemed an aggressor by any single member nation of the Council standing aloof, although the, other members of the Council might not wish to deem that nation an aggressor. This is a very dangerous provision, and one which I fear would be likely to have very serious consequences. A perusal of articles 10 and 11 makes it clear that Britain's position would be quite impossible. Under article 10 the Council may call upon a signatory State to forthwith apply certain sanctions. I disagree with (he Attorney-General and also with Lord Parmoor on the question whether the British Navy would be affected. Article 11 states, infer alia, thatThose obligations sliall bu interpreted as obliging each of the signatory States to cooperate loyally and effectively in support of the Covenant of the League of Nations, and in resistance to any act of aggression in the degree which its geographical position and its particular situation as regards armaments allow. They must also provide transport and be responsible for the safety of communications by land and by, sea of the attacked or threatened State. The British Empire is the greatest naval power, and has also the largest mercantile marine, and this obligation, therefore, would fall to a greater extent upon Britain than upon any other power. It is provided, further, that if the parties to the dispute are aggressors within the meaning of article 10, the economic and financial sanctions shall be applied to both of them. honourable members realize what this may mean to the British Empire, with its enormous naval and mercantile development? Under another clause we would be recouped for our naval and mercantile expenses. As the Daily Telegraph succinctly put it , "" The men who drafted that clause must have been in cold storage for the past five years, and apparently forgot the position Great Britain is in today as a result of the last war."" In considering the Protocol we must not lose sight of the fact that the United States of America is never likely to become a member of the League. I happened to be in America when the Protocol was under consideration, and the only opinions I heard expressed, in business or diplomatic circles, were in opposition to it . An article published in the Chicago Herald Jixaminer on the 2nd November, 1924, by Professor P. M . Brown, professor of international law at, the Princetown University, will give honourable members a very good idea of opinion in the United States of America on the Protocol. The article is headed "" Geneva Protocol is a Direct Menace to America."" Professor Brown states1. Any war of aggression is defined in the preamble of the Protocol as an "" international crime."" Although it is often difficult to determine with certainty who is an actual aggressor, according to the Protocol any nation that adopts vigorous measures for the protection of its citizens and interests is to lie regarded as an aggressor if it has not first obtained the approval of the League. No matter how grave the situation, how urgent the appeal for immediate action, a nation's hands are tied. If American citizens were unjustly imprisoned, subject to cruel treatment and in grave danger, us bus repeatedly happened in various parts of the world, notably in China, our Government eould take no steps to' secure their immediate protection without the previous consent of the Council of the League. If conditions in Haiti or elsewhere on this continent should again become chaotic and threaten the lives and interests of many, we could not land troops to restore order and establish confidence without the authorization of the League. The Monroe Doctrine seems to have been completely ignored and thrown into the discard. If Japan should force an issue over thc question of racial discrimination under our immigration lawsa matter hitherto universally regarded as peculiarly within the exclusive right andpower of any nation-and should seize the Philippine Islands as a gage, it would not be* presumed by the Protocol to be an agDo gressor! The United States alone would be in the wrong! Such are the main characteristics of this amazing document, which was hastily drafted and adopted in an atmosphere of feverish excitement at the recent meeting of the Assembly of the League. There can be no doubt concerning its fundamental purpose to make of the League a powerful superstate. The metliod of friendly voluntary conciliation among nations is to be abandoned in favour ot compulsory conciliation! We are now told by some of the advocates of American membership in the League that the United States' of America"" cannot afford to remain outside of tbe League"" for fear that the rest of the world will combine against us. We arc to be coerced into joining the League in order to defend our interests against such a coalition. If this state of affairs were true it would be a sad commentary on the spirit of the League and an added justification for our policy of political detachment. Fortunately, the United States of America has no reason to fear so base an attitude on the part of other nations-certainl y not from our late allies. We are also told on the authority of Mr the founders of the League of Nations, and Balderston, correspondent of the Aeio York7 World, a strong advocate of the League, thatBeneath the surface of the deep waters of diplomacy in Europe there is a movement afoot to relegate the United States -of America to a secondary position in the yet unborn arms parleys of the nations. The World has obtained a secret memorandum circulated to a few leading representatives now in Geneva, which states with frankness-sinc e the document was never intended to reach American eyesthe reasons why the United States of America should not be permitted to take the initiative, as desired by Mr Coolidsre. -[Ne w York World, 29th September, 1!)24.] In other words this momentous document was rushed through the Assembly partly for the. purpose of attempting to restore the waning prestige of the League, and partly for the purpose of preventing the United States of America from taking thc lead in summoning a world conference on disarmament similar to the Washington conference. straint, more opportunism, more petty politics! Fortunately, there is but slight chance that this Protocol will ever come into force. It must be ratified by "" a majority of the permanent members of the Council ""-the great powers, namely-of whom England' has already indicated reservations on the subject of compulsory arbitration, and others are apparently wavering. And even then the final adoption of the Protocol is made to depend upon the success of the international conference for disarmament to be called at Geneva on 15th June, 1925 (article 21). In thc meantime the League has committed itself in principle to the idea of coercion rather than of voluntary conciliation. It is in a position to make extravagant claims concerning its power to outlaw war. In the meantime the United States of America is precluded from taking any step toward inviting the other nations to a friendly conference to discuss in the peaceful, dispassionate atmosphere of this hemisphere the great problems of international disarmament. No people have ever given greater proof of their preference for conciliatory methods of adjusting disputes, whether between individuals or nations, than the American people. Mr Marks. No people have a greater repugnance for constraint and coercion. We believe that no' set of rules, no elaborate machinery will ever bring peace where no good will exists. And we believe that where good will exists there is no need of rigid rules or constraints of any kind. This is why the American people have reacted so unfavorably to the Geneva Protocol. This is why we have good reason to be thankful that we are not an active party to such questionable proceedings. This is why we are thankful that the United States of America has preserved its entire liberty of action for the advancement of world peace and for the safeguarding of those very principles that originally inspired which now seem imperilled by the ill-considered acts of sentimentalists and political opportunists. That, I think, represents the average opinions expressed to me by leading men in America. As mentioned in the article, the American people first suggested disarmament conferences, but the League of Nations, or the Protocol, prevented further friendly effort on their part. There was a decided objection in every walk of life in America against serious consideration of the provisions of the Protocol. What is to take its place? The position seems to be very much what it was in 1914. I remember making a speech in this chamber in 1920, which brought a good deal of ridicule upon me from most honourable members, the Press and a certain section of the people in Australia, because I was the only dismal pessiMore conmist at a time when every one was celebrating peace. I pointed out at the time that there were anxious times ahead, and I do not wish to withdraw one word which I uttered on that occasion. We have only to look at what has happened during the last five years. An effort should be made to bring about a European and a Pacific pact, because the European people, who are naturally obsessed with the great problems before them-ther e are momentous questions troubling all the' European nations-hav e not the time to worry about a country 13,000 miles away. It is really a case of the nations of the Pacific loking after themselves. When I was in Japani n 1923, the Prime Minister( Mr P.ruce) suggested a Pacific conference, and the fact was brought under m* notice wh'-.n addressing the Pan-Pacifif 'Jnion at Tokio. The suggestion was received in Japan with a good deal of interest and enthusiasm, but in the event of such a conference being con-ened, Japan wished to reserve her right to express the conditions under which such a conference should be called. Nothing has, however, eventuated, with the exception of the action taken by the leaders of the Labour movement in Australia, who have rightly asked their representatives to convene a conference in Sydneyi n a few weeks' time, and it is hoped that some good will result. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman) very rightly dealt ment did right in rejecting it without with the question of disarmament from the stand-point of Christianity and the brotherhood of man. I hold very strong views on that aspect of the question, and believe that if the Church were to take a more active part the problem would at least be simplified. It is to be hoped that the Prime Minister, or some other responsible authority, will convene a conference of the Pacific powers, at which international questions can be discussed, and an effort made by interested nations to assist each other, and to ensure so far as is possible disarmament and peace in the Pacific. a large number of seamen, who took a misguided action on wrong advice, have been imprisoned in Australia. Who on vessels that carried our troops, and helped to conserve of the Empire during the war. I have conversed with several whom I met in Cardiff some time ago, and am surprised at the action of those responsible for their imprisonment. They have not shown that regard for the brotherhood of man which alone can help us to come together and try to overcome our troubles. I think the Government has done right in rejecting the Protocol, first of all on the grounds suggested by the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) and, secondly, because under the ArticleI have quoted, I think it would be necessary for the British Navy in the event of one of the parties to a dispute being adjudged the aggressor, to do all the dirty work at sea against that power. As America is not a member of the League, a situation might possibly arise in which that nation could be termed the aggressor, and the British Navy might receive orders from the League to blockade and bombard the American coast. could easily arise under the Protocol. A still greater absurdity is that it would also be possible, if something cropped up here, and Australia were declared, to be pOl] the aggressor, for the British Navy to be ordered to blockade Australian ports. That phase of the question was very ably dealt with in the Daily Telegraph, Lord Burnham's publication, when I was in England. A Protocol embodying such a condition could not possibly be accepted by tlie Commonwealth; and I am, therefore, clearly of the opinion that the Governcalling Parliament .together to discuss it . Something has to take its place. Mr. Austen Chamberlain is doing his best to bring about a European pact, but no European international arrangement can be regarded as satisfactory unless Germany is a party to it . Last year I travelled thousands of miles through Germany, and visited her great cities and factories. Of all the important powers which participated in the Great War, Germany alone is functioning. To use a phrase common amongst sportsmen, Germany is ""priceless."" German curI am. particularly sorry that rency has been stabilized, her artisans are working 60 hours a week, her factories are equipped with the most modern machinery, and, industrially, are these men? Many were everything is proceeding satisfactorily. Notwithstanding the fact that Germany the food was the defeated nation, she is a great fighting power to-day, and no Protocol is worth a continental snap unless Germany is a party to it . So long as Russia, with a population of 130,000,000, is governed by some 400,000 communists, knowing the communists aa I do, I think her co-operation should not be considered. Germany, France, Italy, and Great Britain, and the other signatories, without the assistance of Russia, should be able to ensure international leace in Europe at least for a time. An effort should also be made simultaneously for America, Japan, China, the Dutch, and Australia to arrive at* some arrangement suitable to all in regard to the Pacific. If two pacts such as I have mentioned we're in operation, the international situation of the world would be much brighter than it appears to be at present. Honourable members may well ask me why I hold the views I do, and why I am so keen on Such a position defence. Whatever Australia does should be in co-operation with Great Britain's scheme for the defence of the BritishE mpire, and our ships should be of a type -Which would enable them to effectively co-operate with those of the Royal Navy should the occasion arise. think there >is going to be any trouble in the Pacific; I never have thought so. I am heartily in favour of the B ritish scheme of defence, which is our best insurance against attack. Navy can go anywhere at any time, preserving the great trade routes of our grand and mighty Empire. congratulate the honourable members who comprised the delegation f r c m Australia to the F if t h Assembly of the League of Nations. There was true co-ordination of effort, and loyal co-operation among them, and they were able lo give their best services in dealing with the momentous questions that came under consideration. One cannot f a i l to appreciate the merit of the contributions that have been made to this debate. Considerable enlightenment has been afforded in regard to matters of international concern and the means suggested for promoting world peace. But I protest against the action of the Government in failing to provide an earlier opportunity than this for the consideration of the report of the delegation to the last Assembly. The report should have been discussed as soon as possible after the return of the delegates, so that Parliament might have directed to some extent the vote and voice of the delegates to the sixth Assembly. The House has been placed in an anomalous position. Surely honourable members do not view with approval the Government's action in depriving them of their rights in this respect. I hope that when this year's delegation returns to Australia the government of the day will take the earliest opportunity of affording honourable members time for the discussion of the report. Last year the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) was appointed a member of the delegation, but this ye""ar the Government has. without reason, departed from that excellent principle. I claim that the prestige of the Commonwealth suffered in no way owing to a representative of the Opposition being included in the Australian delegation to the F if t h Assembly of the League; rather was it enhanced by the presence of the Leader of the Opposition. that both sides of the House should be represented at any international council to which Australia inay desire to send I do not delegates. I believe that the personnel of the F if t h Assembly was more democratic than it has ever been. The voice of democracy was heard, and the world was advised to adopt peaceful means of settling international disputes. The TheB ritish opinion was emphatic that, instead of having recourse to war, the nations should accept some form of arbitration in determining the destinies of the peoples of the I world. International problems are always complex, and governments generally move with extreme caution. I wish that this Government had exercised due care when it forwarded to the British Government an expression of the alleged view of this country concerning the Protocol. Had the Government consulted the delegates of the F if t h Assembly, had it recognized the merit of the Protocol, a reply f a r different from that given would have been sent. Unfortunately, the Government declared a policy of hostility to the Protocol, and one that, I venture to say, is not endorsed by the majority of the people. I believe that if a vote,of the electors were taken, the great majority would support the Protocol. Owing to cablegrams fro m Geneva and press comments in Australia, a certain number of the people doubted the wisdom of adopting it , and in some quarters a feeling even of hostility was engendered, but this was entirely due to a misconception of the full purpose of the Protocol. I hope that in future the press of Australia and elsewhere will recognize its obligation to represent all public issues faithfully . A higher standard of morality is needed in the life of nations, particularly as far as the press is concerned. harsh things concerning the press in the past, and not without justification. I hope that a sense of decency w ill compel the press to present issues of international moment in their true light, particularly to those nations that are. far removed from the scenes of international disputes and deliberations.

I feel that the British Elnpire lost a golden opportunity to promote peace when it declined to r a t if y the Protocol, imperfect as it might have been. That instrument probably could have been moulded so as to meet almost any Emergency that might arise in an international conflict. Roth Williams! author of The League, the Protocol, and the Empire,, which has been so aptly quoted by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman), expresses a feeling that is growing up among the nations of the League concerning the attitude of Great Britain. He saysWe have an evil reputation abroad for humbugging, for having things both ways, and for pursuing naked self-interest under a cloak of the loftiest morality. These suspicions-agai n rightly or wrongly, but flamed up again with redoubled vigor since the advent to power and the first acts of the Conservative Government. Those are indeed very strong words. If our international reputation is being so Beriously impaired by the faults of British statesmen, it is very necessary that we in Australia should assert our views, so that our attitude may not be misunderstood in the counsels of the nations. The author of this book has further expressed the view that throughout Europe the Protocol is being supported by the moderate and progressive parties as a big step forward along the path to peace, and that it is being opposed by the nationalists and militarists for reasons that apply equally well to the Covenant, and, in factj. to every attempt to organize peace by international co-operation. If there is any logic in the arguments advanced by honourable members, and by interests in Australia and abroad, that the Protocol does not meet the requirements of the situation, those arguments could, with greater force, be levelled against the Covenant itself. The Protocol has been framed with the idea of eliminating many of the imperfections of the Covenant. It seems to me that certain great nations, with powers of oppression at their command, are prepared to support the League of Nations only so long as it does not interfere with their concerns The greater Powers of Europe, or trespass on some selfish advantage they are endeavouring to seek. We cannot accept a seat on the council of international justice unless we are prepared to live according to the best and highest standards of international justice and equity. Unfortunately, it appears that the British nation has not given that assistance and sympathetic co-operation that it should give in matters affecting international relationships. For that we have the Conservative statesmen of Great Britain to blame. If there is one thing that stands to the credit of Ramsay MacDonald, it is that he endeavoured to create a more cordial relationship between the nations of the earth. He did more in his short term of office to ensure international security and peace than any other government has done. He expressed the loftiest ideals, and yet people complained that he gave too much attention to foreign policy. It is regrettable that the Government that succeeded him undid much useful indubitably-hav e work commenced by him . His efforts were whole-heartedly supported by members of the great Australian Labour movement. We recognize that if we can secure an agreement among the nations to l i m it armaments, the money now spent on defence and preparations for defence w ill be available for promoting the health, learning, and welfare of the people generally. That would bring more permanent and lasting benefit than entering into pacts, treaties, and understandings that are likely ultimately to embroil us in conflicts. It is my sincere hope that this House will definitely declare for the convening of an international Disarmament Conference,' and give a lead to the nations in expressing a desire to substantially limit armaments and preparations of a warlike character. U n it y can be reached only by weakening antagonism and by developing trust and toleration. Some honourable members' opposite say that they are firm believers in the principle of industrial arbitration. They insist that we should settle all our' industrial disputes by appeals to constituted authority, and anyone who deigns to express, an opposite view, or to take action involving a cessathat the Government intended to deal tion of industrial operations, becomes an outlaw of society, and a disrupter of the peace. Such a person is likely to be caught by the long arm of the law and brought before a notorious board, with a view to having his liberty curtailed. He is held to be unworthy to occupy a place in the counsels of the nation, or even to enjoy the privileges of lay before a measure relating to it can citizenship. The same honourable members, however, are not prepared to accept arbitration for the settlement of international disputes. They contend that the only way to provide for the security of a nation is to have recourse to conflict. It appears to me that the Austraoccur. It is undesirable, however, that lian people are bound by the provisions of the Covenant. The learned interpretations we have listened to in this chamber to-day of our position under the Protocol indicate that there is disagreetherefore, to introduce at an early date ment among those to whom we look for advice. The simple truth is that there was a sincere desire on the part of those who framed the Protocol to overcome the disadvantages, anomalies, and inconsistencies in the Covenant. It is designed to secure the peace of the world and the welfare of the nations, and Australia has nothing to lose by accepting its main principles. those reservations that have created a false impression in the minds of other nations.

They also complain that such restrictions are imposed on them as to make promotion impossible. I have been asked to make an immediate personal inquiry into the matter. Possibly similar requests have been made to other honourable members. I shall be glad if affected as they say, I trust he will take all steps possible to remedy their grievances. evening the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) referred to 'an article that had appeared in a certain weekly",42,Littleto N Groom

94,Mr Gregory (Swan) [4.3],"Lastmade by tbe honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) in reply. I havo been closely associated with the Town and Country Union, and I protest against the very grave reflections that have been caBt against it. It is doing good work for Australia. Its general object is to reduce the eost of living and the eost of production. By so doing, it believes that it will promote the prosperity of Australia. before Parliament, it seems to be customary for certain newspapers to assail the honour and integrity of honourable members who dare to protest against the proposed increased duties. During the tariff debate of 1921, the Industrial Australian, a newspaper which is generally regarded as being most respectable, made very gravo reflections upon all who' opposed the proposed increased duties. They were denounced as supporters of foreign trade. A paragraph in an article in that paper, which dealt with the tariff schedule then before Parliament, read as follows:We are informed that it is supported by a each, from a couple of old-age pensioners, secret organization endowed with an enormous and I returned them immediately. fighting Fund, doubtless foreign.. As one who had the honour of leading the attack against the high duties then proposed, I wish to say that I had no nnancial support on that occasion, except that provided by the Courtry parties of Western Australia and Victoria, and the Chamber of Mines in Western Australia, in regard to the preparation of certain statistical information, and for statistical information only. No outside organization, firm, or person contributed one penny. Not one penny of outside money was donated to assist us in that fight. I challenge those who advocate thc imposition of high duties to say that they have never been assisted by contributions from outside sources. I never saw such disgraceful articles published in the press as those which appeared in the Melbourne newspapers at the time the Oodnadatta contract wns being held in abeyance. Threats were made at that time that if Ministers and honourable members who supported the Goverument did not take a particular course, certain action would be taken to destroy the Government. A statement was made by either the President or Vice-President of the Ohamber of Manufactures in New South Wales to the effect that if the' Government did not introduce legislation to provide for the imposition of high duties, the chamber would support the Labour party. I have been told, although I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the statement, that many large manufacturing concerns make donations annually to the Protectionist organizations of Australia, and to certain political Whenever tariff proposals are organizations as well. never gets any of them. of the manufacturers must tell untruths.

I know the Leader of the Opposition well enough to be certain that if any person offered him a donation in consideration of his adopting a certain attitude, he would immediately expose him. They would not go to him; but they would send subscriptions to the organization. There are few honourable members in this chamber in whose personal honour I have a stronger belief. are of the same opinion. orable member for Maribyrnong has a similar opinion of the Leader of the Government, and of others on this side of the House. It is quite understandable that manufacturers would feel favourably disposed to any party whose policy was sympathetic to this industry, but tbere are some people in every organization who would descend to any level to serve their own dirty and greedy ends. I wish to say that I know nothing whatever about the letter that was quoted last night.

102,Mr Gregoryi Trust That The Hon,"ho idea whether it is genuine or whether such a letter was ever written. I am not at all concerned about whether high duties arc imposed upon pianos, playerpianos, or other luxuries. I am only concerned about the imposition of ""high duties on the necessities of life and of production. I know nothing about the person whose signature appears at. the foot of that letter. A few undesirable people seem to find an entrance into every political organization. I am quite satisfied that Mr Hagelthorn, with whom I have been closely associated for the last six months, is doing good work for Australia. He devotes an enormous amount of his time to his public duty, and Australia has no better publicspirited man than he. He is doing what he believes to be in the best interests of Australia; that is, he desires to have reduced the cost of living and the cost of production. I believe that the Town and. Country Union is serving Australia well, although, of course, a difference of opinion on that matter is quite likely. Tho writer of the letter published in the newspaper referred to last night stated that he was prepared to give a subscription to the organization if it would support a policy favorable to his business. Any man who would make a statement of that description deserves condemnation. If that is a genuine letter, action ought to be taken against the writer. I think the fetter was badly composed, however, tor it speaks about bringing political pressure upon Nationalist members. That seems to me to be quite unwarranted. I utterly repudiate the letter, and I consider that the writer of it ought to be brought to book. 1 repeat that, in my opinion, the organization that has been attacked is doing clean and good work, which. will ultimately prove to be in the best interests of this country. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [ 4 .
