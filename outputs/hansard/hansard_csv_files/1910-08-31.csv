28,Mr Glynn,"It includes -freeholdsof course, the necessity, when a State has to raise greater revenue, to plant it on land under that value. So that really this is not the sop which some persons think it is to small holders. It is not in the long run a very effective move, because it is merely a shelving of the unpopularity of the tax from this Parliament on to the State Legislature. But there can be found an exemption which will be quite consistent with the true 'theory of taxation, and it is one which we did urge over twenty years ago in the State Parliament. your exemption so that it will be consistent with the principle of a so-called unearned increment, then it ought to be per acreage. mately the amount per acre which was originally paid to the State, ancl if you do that it will mean, not an unfair advantage, but a great benefit to the agriculturist, the man whose lancl value is largely represented by the application to it of his capital, his labour, and his enterprise. It will be a very great benefit to him. The unearned increment increases as you go along, until you get to the very centre of your big cities, when the exemption will be comparatively small ; your tax under the system I suggest will fall upon the holder of practically only the added value. Suppose that your exemption is, say, £ 2 an acre-it might be £ 1 , but I . suggest £ 2 if you want to commence with a pretty liberal exemption. According to the figures df; the Prime Minister, the sold lancl brought to the £123,000,000. He stated that the Victorian increase was about five times the amount of the value originally, as determined by the purchase money. take then, five times the value of the lancl when sold by the State-and that was set down at about £123,000,000-w e get a total unimproved .value of £615,000,000. That, if anything, may be under the estimate, because the Attorney-General yesterday made a rough estimate of about £71.4,000,000 as being the value of the lands, the number of whose owners he stated. . Deducting your £ 2 an acre, that would mean a deduction of £246,000,000, and there would remain to be taxed £370,000,000, which, at a tax of i d . , would yield about £1,451,000. In other words, it would give the Commonwealth what the Treasurer says he will get, about £1,000,000 a year for Federal purposes; and it would give the States, by an arrangement which could easily be come to with them, between £500,000 and £600,000, being the amount, approximately, of their present receipts from taxation of land. There is no revolution involved in that. It is a fair tax; it is not oppressive, it avoids duplication, ancl it will tend, as a somewhat similar tax has tended in South Australia, to the diminution of large estates, which are purely agricultural, and which are being run for pastoral purposes. The Treasurer stated that If you make the present land taxation in four States yielded £599,000. He mentioned, I think, a revenue of £351,000 for four States, but, the tax being municipal in New South You ought to exempt approxiWales, the total taxation, whether it is received by municipalities by permission of the Government, or by the States, would be about £600,000. Such a tax as I have mentioned would practically give the States what they have at present, ancl yield us, without any confiscation or undue pressure, a revenue such as the Treasurer estimates from what I consider an unjust metiiod of taxation. Summed up, such a method would be economic taxation. It would, as I said, relieve the agriculturists. It would get a return from the increased value: in proportion to it, and without confiscation. It would induce subdivision, and do so without gradually congesting the market, which is a very serious matter. Now, on that point, let me mention that in about 1858, the British Parliament passed what was known as the Encumbered Estates Court Act, for the State Governments purpose of enabling mortgagees of Irish land to sell out expeditiously, and give a parliamentary title. In Ireland there is. under this legislation, a Court called If you the Landed Estates Court. It supervises the sale of landed properties, and gives, on the title being cleared up, a parliamentary title. The result of the passing of that measure, and bringing it into force at once throughout the lancl, was that estates, whose true value was twenty-four and twenty-five vears' purchase of the rental, were sold for six and seven years' purchase of the rental. Irr other words, men had, in cases, lost fromtwo-thirds to three-fourths of the truevalue of their properties through the sudden congestion of the market, by a measure similar in operation to this one. If vou do force-and I do not believe that yon can, because men will have to bear this' tax-to the limits of your desire and vour policy, large estates on the market, it will mean a serious declination in merely framers of the Constitution, and had prices-to an extent which no man could no mandate as to policy from the people, I .honestly justify.

Are you to come down, or demethod of meeting the general expenditure in clare that to be a permanent ideal? I preference to the system of Customs duties merely ask the question. said that this was only the thin edge of a wedge. mentwas repeated during the last campaign. I believe it is the policy of the Victorian Labour party to adopt an exemption of £500, but in any case the amount will come gradually down. I think that the country is entitled to an express statement 011 this point from the Government. If we recognise their so-called mandate, and endorse their policy, what will be the result of its attainment? A subdivision down to areas worth £5,000. While it is our chuv to criticise according to our lightsI hope, paying every deference to the motives which animate honourable members opposite-som e of us have been quite as liberal on the point of taxation, and thtt Federal taxation of lancl, as have honourable members supporting the Government. When the question of Customs and Excise was discussed in the Federal Convention, and some delegates argued that the Commonwealth should never exercise, while some thought it should never have, the power of taxation, I said in Adelaide, and repeated in Sydney, that, if I thought that the Commonwealth was never to have the power of lightening the load of indirect taxation by the exercise of the power of direct taxation, I should advise the people to vote against the Constitution. It was understood that this power should be given to us in reserve-that is how it is understood in America, as I shall show from decisions of the Supreme Court-to be used, as was stated by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, when the decline in the Customs ancl Excise revenue showed the necessity of imposing a direct tax. At the Sydney sittings of the Convention, it was thought that a very liberal margin on the figures we had in Adelaide would put the new expenditure of the Commonwealth for many years at £600,000 per annum. That estimate has been exceeded, but I said then that if our new expenditure were not to exceed that amount, then, but for the fact that we were When you have attained your that expenditure by a fair land tax I certainly would go in for a direct tax-as a which so unduly absorbs the earnings of .the people . . . . The value of the land whicli the state of the industrial ancl commercial atmosphere. The rise and f a l l of the wealth of the State might be accurately gauged by the existing condition of land values. 1 did not desire to abolish Customs duties, because in a country like this we could not do so; but I said that when it became a question of apportioning taxation according to necessities and earnings, amongst the community, one had to consider the equity of some measure of direct taxation, as against what was very often the grinding burden of our extreme indirect taxation. Our aim should be to avoid duplication. This Bill does not attempt anything of the kind. On the contrary, it brings about duplication, two imposts on_ one owner. Our aim, further, should be to attain simplicity. But there is no simplicity in this measure. It does not provide for a tax that will be uniform, even with the South Australian tax, which is a true tax upon land values; and its framers have not remembered that what they ought to propose is taxation, not confiscation. Labour party in the South Australian Parliament, in 1895, tabled a motion to transfer to direct taxation some of the burden of indirect taxation upon the necessaries of life, I supported him; but I pointed out that we must not confiscate. I urged that "" to nationalize by confiscation all rental values would be unjust and impolitic."" I make that quotation, in order to prevent any misapprehension of the scope of my proposals. The conditions, as I have said, are such as at present involve, at all events, relative duties. We cannot apply abstract theories to the taxation of a society in which millions of money are invested on behalf of comparatively small men-me n who have only a meagre competence-throug h the agency of various institutions. The Australian Mutual Provident Society, for instance, which is a very beneficial institution, being based upon the mutual principle, has something like 70,000 policyholders, and an investment of £[12,000,000 or £13,000,000 on mortgages of land.",17,Notice Of Questions Postmaster General S Department Australian Contract Postmasters

Coming to .the operation of a moderate tax, let me point out that in South Australia in 1895 the unimproved land values tax, which, I think, had been a halfpenny in the £ 1 all round, was raised, and it is now one penny in the £ 1 on values over £5,000. Commissioner of Taxes, in a report in 1906, stated that large holders of lancl were realizing and disposing of their lands as opportunities offered. Especially was this being done by absentee owners, where they could sell, ancl were untrammelled by any trust instructions. Mr Hall, another lancl tax expert, as well as Mr Spiller, who was then, I think, Deputy Commissioner of Taxes in South Australia, also spoke of the effect of the tax on country holdings. Thus, in that State a moderate tax such as we suggest has operated to bring about gradually, and without any dislocation of interests, a proper system of subdivision. If we could make some arrangements with the States as regards land taxation, so as to avoid duplication, and have only one valuation for all purposes throughout Australia Wales, for instance, land in one district is valued on one basis, and a valuation in another district is made on a different basis. interjection emphasizes the expediency of bringing about some degree of uniformity. It should be an easy matter to arrange with the States to allow' us, with their help, to make a valuation throughout Australia, and an arrangement could be arrived at for a fair uniform tax, based upon that valuation, and apportioned on equitable lines bevision must be made for existing leasestween the States ancl the Commonwealth. If the States did require, for local purposes, to add to that tax they could use the valuation that had been made by us. Under this Bill, however, there will be a valuation for Commonwealth purposes in South Australia, not to mention the other States, every year, whilst there will be a valuation for the purposes of the State every five years. The valuations will be made on different dates, and although ment of the unimproved value-the y are to be made in different ways. The South Australian Act, as compared with this measure, is simplicity and efficiency itself. I do not wish to dwell upon this point. I desire only to endeavour to make a few suggestions, recognising that it is our duty, while criticising the Government scheme, to show in what way our acknowledged necessities can be faced, and fairly met, by some other method. The Treasurer estimates that this tax will yield £1,000,000 per annum, and it may be that we could charge The the defence expenditure up to that amount to a tax levied on the lines I have outlined. As population increased, the necessity for defence would increase, but in like manner the proceeds of thu tax, being based on the unimproved value, would also increase. As population goes ahead, so does the value of land, and without even an increase of the rates, we should thus be able to get what was necessary for the purposes of defence. I make the suggestion, because honourable members opposite, in conceiving this tax, do not seem to me to have gone thoroughly to the bottom of the question. They did not really exhaust all the alternatives that were open to them while remaining consistent to their ideas as to desirable reforms. Why is this Bill cumbered with provisions for the valuation of the lessee's interest as distinguished from that of the freeholder? We have not only the provisions in the Bill itself, but a suggestion of other provisions which have been modified, while some have been abandoned since the Bill was introduced. Last night we had another complex method-perhap s mathematically correct, but certainly most complex from the ordinary point of view of comprehension-of assessing the total value of the land that must be assigned to the lessee as against the owner of the reversion. In South Australia we disregard the lessee. In the State Act, as passed in 1884, it was provided-becaus e some prothatThe burden of the land tax This is a very simple provision dealing with the division of the valuation between the leaseholder and the reversionershall be distributed between the taxpayers in the relative proportions of the value of their interests in the land taxed.",19,Smith Senato R Stewart Would Be Taxed Would Be A Perfect Barometer Of

41,Mr Glynn,"Well, it is taken into When the old Feudal service was abolishedMy opinion is that this principle is purely academic. I do not think that it affects the constitutionality of the proposed tax; but, generally, the question has been considered from the following points of view : there, under the Constitution, a rule of uniformity that has been broken, or is there discrimination between States ancl parts of States? Is there a violation of the provisions of section 99 of the Constitution, which prevents us by our revenue laws from giving a preference to one State or part of a State over another State or part of a State? Or is this under the guise of taxation really a Bill in relation to land settlement-whic h brings us back to the dictum of the High Court in The King v. Barger that, as laid down by the Chief justiceIn determining whether a particular law is or so comes under the other principle that a is not within the power of the Commonwealth tax must be a tax, and not in substance Parliament to enact, regard must be had to its something else. substance rather than its literal form. The indirect effect and motive are irrelevant. There is on the point of uniformity no express provision in our Constitution that a tax must be uniform. There is a provision as regards discrimination, which I have mentioned. In the United States, however, there is a provision that a tax must be uniform. In the United States taxation is divided into direct taxes, duties, imposts, and excise. Thus there are four classes of taxation. The rule as regards direct taxation is that it must be ih proportion to population. Then there is the rule of uniformity. Indirect taxation must be uniform. The object of the provision as regards direct taxation being in proportion to population is to prevent the power of numbers being unduly oppressive to accumulated property in particular States. In the case of Pollock v. The Farmers' Loan and Trust Company, Chief Justice Fuller states the principleNothing can be clearer than what the Constitution intended to guard against was the exercise by the general Government of the power of directly taxing persons and properties within any State through a majority made from the other States. It is true that the effect of requiring direct taxes to be apportioned among the States in proportion to their population is necessarily that the amount of taxes on the individual taxpayer in a State having the taxable subject-matter to a larger extent in proportion to its popurect, taxation. The other principle is that lation than any other S'tate, but this inequality must be held to have been contemplated ancl was manifestly designed to operate to restrain the exercise of the power of direct taxation to extraordinary emergencies, to prevent attack upon accumulated property by the mere force of nurnhers. The Supreme Court held that the law made provision against confiscation; but really, as regards basing the tax upon population, as in the case of a good many imposts, the rule would work injustice. If , say, an income tax were declared to be valid, you Is would have to apportion the tax on a population basis between the States, whose populations might be such that the wealth of one State might be by no means as great as that of another, the result really being that one State would have to pay about as much income tax as another. I think that there is no rule of uniformity here. We have power to make exceptions. Parliament has, undoubtedly, the power to select a class. It is only restrained in doing that by the rule that it must not encroach in its 'election of a class upon : the reserve power of the States. To do able member say that we could impose differential telephone rates if we chose? between States or parts of States. I do not want to be led off the track by dealing with that point, but I think we could do so. There is no rule to say that we cannot differentiate. We can select a class. Not only can we, according to Cooley, whose work is the leading authority on the subject, select a particular class for taxation, but even we may differentiate between the members of a class. The point has really not been decided in America. I am giving the views of particular authorities, but the terms of our Constitution are not identical with those of the United States Constitution. constitutional doctrine, we could impose differential postal and telegraphic rates. believe to be the correct interpretation of the Constitution. After some pretty close study of the competent authorities-and there is, under our Constitution, no rule of uniformity similar to the American ruleI say that the American principle of uniformity applies to only indiof discrimination between States and parts of States, and the High Court has held that ""parts of States"" does not necessarily mean parts of different States, but may mean differentiation between a part of one State ancl another part of the same State.

The Bill may operate somewhat harshly in the case of city lands which are being put to their best possible use, but not so harshly as is supposed. For instance, the most valuable city blocks may run up to £250,000 in unimproved value, as is the case in Sydney, in one instance, to my knowledge. Above £70,000 in value land will bear a tax of od. in the £ 1 , and, in addition, the owner has to pay i d . in the £ 1 municipal tax and is. 9d. in the £ 1 on the rental value, but the latter is assessed pretty low, and the tax in that connection is not one-twelfth of what would have to be paid in the case of a 5 per cent, tax on the unimproved value. The rental value tax of is. 9d. in the £ 1 comes to about £1,300 per year, whereas a 5 per cent, tax on the unimproved value would mean about £12,000 a year. Seeing that the tax of 6d. in the £ 1 will only operate on values over £70,000 or £80,000, it is no great hardship, and, after all, we are only asking for equality of sacrifice if not equality of taxation. Where great wealth has accumulated in this way, it is due to the monopoly of the lands, which has made the people an easy prey, owing to the bar to natural access; for in this way the labour market has become glutted, and made the exploitation of labour easy. Exemptions are made with every justice, especially in regard to country lands. When men are applying all their energy to the development of their lands, it would be unfair to impose on them another tax unless we remove some of the burdens they already bear. I am aware that this is a view not often expressed, but it appeals to me as being perfectly logical. There are vast areas of land, as good as those which are being intensely tilled in many parts of the country, not used at all except as sheep walks, and it is only fair that the owners of the latter should bear their proportion of the cost of government. The man who tills his land as it ought to be tilled is helping to pay the cost of government in various ways, and the man who is not tilling his land is certainly not assisting materially to that end. member not think that the owner who uses his land for grazing would be perfectly willing to let it for agricultural purposes, in order to bring about the same result? many cases owners are not prepared to let their land-the y will not be bothered with tenants. Not long ago, a man in my electorate said that he could make 100 per cent, by letting his land, or putting it under agriculture. He could get a return of 30s. an acre from lancl used for agricultural purposes, but it would cost him 30s. an acre; whereas, by spending is. an acre he could get a return of 18s. an acre with sheep. In the latter case, he makes eighteen times what he spends, whereas with agriculture he can only make twice what he spends. No doubt, he could make more money by letting; but, as I have said, he will not be bothered with tenants. There may be such cases as those suggested by the honourable member for Parkes, but they are not sufficient to explode my argument. It would be unfair to ask the small man, who is paying many taxes, particularly in the shape of railway freights, to pay any more under present conditions, if we impose a tax without a reasonable exemption, we should, in justice, relieve such men of many of the burdens they now bear, and this House has no power to remove the most pressing of them. I have special instances in my mind of one or two farmers who, I know, are paying in railway freights alone more than is the squatter who adjoins them. The latter has just as good lancl, may be 10,000 or 20,000 acres, and if every 200 or 300 acres were paying the same railway freights as are paid by the farmer, this would be a very different country indeed, and there would be no need for this",23,Smith Senato R Stewart Would Be Taxed Would Be A Perfect Barometer Of

As time goes on, and more land is ing their just obligations, and making the small man always bear the burden. could give concrete cases, but it is hardly worthwhile taking up time. It is plain to all that the small man, who is intensely cultivating his land, pays more, in proportion, to the revenue than does the big man. The basic principle of the Bill forms the ABC of political economy. The people have a right to the unearned increment which has been created as the population has grown and the country has been developed. work in this country has helped to create land values ; but I need not enlarge on that point, because it is now an accepted axiom that the people have the right to the values they create. trouble is, I admit, that there are vested interests which have grown up in the unearned value. Land bought for a mere song may be now worth a thousand times its original value, and has been bought and paid for, and at its present price. Many life assurance societies and other financial institutions depend largely for their income on the interest derived from such values; and if we were to appropriate the full unearned increment, to which we have a moral right, we should undoubtedly dislocate society. That, however, w e do not advoT cate; in fact, if anything, we have been' too careful in the incidence of the proposed taxation, which is so adjusted that it will not precipitate large areas of land on the ' market. The economic rental is considered to be JS. in the £i, but we have not asked for this, or even half of it, until the land is something, like £70,000 in value. If we had sought to impose a tax of 6d. in the £1 on all estates of £10,000 in value, there might have been something in the assertion that we were going to destroy land -values, undermine the financial fabric, and precipitate a crisis. If we sought to impose such a tax, we might be doing greater injury to the poor man than to the rich, -though all would suffer. We do not propose anything of the kind, but, because we seek to differentiate and make distinctions, the Opposition at once say the tax is unjust and unfair. I claim that the view I put forward is the correct one, and that -we are now seeking, in a discreet and careful manner, by means of a graduated tax, Mr Carr. VVe are not only suffering from to get for the people a fair proportion of the values they create, without destroying securities, or bringing about any financial wanted, we shall have to deal further with I the land problem; indeed, it will have to be dealt with again and again, because values are constantly accruing, and necessitating re-appraisements. I agree with James Russell Wallace, that we should have a. Doomsday Book, registering the value of all lands, and decree that, from a given date, all increase in value should go to the Crown. Due notice should be given, so that there may be no danger of vested interests springing up; and thus we could safely and rightly Whoever has done any secure land values for the public. That, I believe, will be the solution of the great land problem, but, in the meantime, we must do something. We require people and money, and we can only obtain both by the The proposals in this Bill. I am not conversant with all the data in regard to the lands throughout Australia, but we all have a general knowledge; and I am convinced that there are too many broad acres of idle land. If any further proof were needed, a glance at the map on the wall of this chamber should convince us that the country is not settled as it should be, but that, on the contrary, we are simply flaunting ourselves on an empty continent. done most to keep people out of the country? lands are partly responsible; but, seeing that the Government have the power to alter the conditions, past Administrations are also absolutely responsible. member's party have tried to prevent the immigration of our own kith and kin for the last ten years. uttering one of those half-truths, which is worse than a lie.

But the State Governments have neglected to fulfil their obligation, and, though for fifty years they have had opportunities to devise some more effective and equitable system of land settlement, they have never taken advantage of them. Apart, altogether, from our immediate financial needs, this Bill deals with a national question. Our population must be augmented enormously if we are to continue secure in our possession of this country. Patriotism alone should be sufficient to convince those whose personal interest may prompt them to oppose this measure, that it is necessary there should be such an alteration in the existing condition of affairs as we propose to bring about.

I told the electors what we proposed to do, with the result that I secured a larger majority than when I stood for the electorate before. The electors were enthusiastic about having this question dealt with by the Federal Government, in view of the fact that the State Governments of New South Wales have delayed dealing with it for so long. there are Upper Houses, comprised of men holding large vested interests, and very often packed with gentlemen whom the country has rejected, but who are put into the Upper House by the Government of the day to legislate for the rest of their natural lives, without let or hindrance, because they are beyond the reach of the people. The Upper House in the State Parliament of New South Wales has been one of the main obstacles in preventing the settlement of the land question. The people of the State have recognised that drastic legislation on the question is hopeless unless they send tb Parliament men from amongst themselves who are familiar with the condition of affairs and are prepared to deal with it. New South Wales has sent so many members of our party to this Parliament, because we are the only party that has attempted to grapple with the problem by the introduction of a measure which has been effectively prevented by the influence of vested interests in the past. Referring to the condition of things in New South Wales, I may quote the following short letter which appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph a couple of days ago under the heading, "" Gambling in Land ""Sir,A short time ago the question "" What is JOHN FORREST -Hav e not the gambling "" was discussed in the columns of your paper. It never appeared to cross the minds of any of your correspondents to quote the Government method of apportioning land opened for so called selection.

I find in regard to these vast areas of leasehold land that the Government received last year from 128,000,000 acres only £604,707 in rent, which pans out at about i£d. per acre.

Apparently, according to the honourable member, we simply apply taxation to get enough money to carry on the Government. I hold that there are great economic principles involved in the methods by which we raise money to carry on the affairs of the country. By imposing taxation in one form we do harass development, prevent the country from coming to its own, and the people from getting' an opportunity to make it what it ought to be.

98,Mr Carr,"I won my seat by talkingforms of industry. If there is one system of taxation more than another which results, not only in raising revenue, but in increasing prosperity, it is the system of unimproved land value taxation, because by it we make it unprofitable to keep the natural resources of the country idle. That is an economic truth which I need not labour, because I am sure honourable members opposite fully recognise the great advantage of a land tax to be that it stimulates industry, and practically forces prosperity. It must do so. Once you make it unprofitable to hold usable lands idle, you confer the gieatest boon upon the community that any Government can confer. If we can do this by taxation, then that form of taxation stands alone as being the most desirable form. I therefore combat the sentiment of the Leader of the Opposition, that we do not apply a tax to stimulate industry, or to promote the public welfare. We emphatically do so in applying a land tax. He further said that this tax would operate to the extent of taking 25 per cent, of some people's incomes, and 50 or even 75 per cent, from others. If it will do that, it I saw when I was there, I am satisfied that proves conclusively that some people hold land at an infinitesimal part of what it is woith. It proves that or nothing. If the tax is going to cut into their income to that extent, it only shows at what ridiculous rates they must be holding the land, and that they should be paying a good deal more for it, or making a good deal more out of it, because we levy on its value. I am fully aware of the fact that many men with large areas do notmake as much as do others with small areas, but that is their fault, and not the fault of the land. That is the very thing that we are suffering from. Men are not putting the land to its best purpose, and are not making as much out of it as could be made. I do not mind them making more out of it so long as they use it. If our tax is going to take so much of their income, it will at once have the effect of inducing them to do something more with the land, and making it produce greater wealth than it now does, so that the percentage named by the honourable member will be considerably .diminished, and, instead of taking 25, 50, or 75 per cent, of their income, we shall be taking _what would be a reasonable thing, namely, about 1 per cent., according to the tax. levied on the value of the land, and not on the amount of money that a man, by his indifferent handling of it, may make out of it. The Leader of the Opposition also said it was for the people to say whether this tax shall be applied. In the name of all that is sacred, have not the people said it? What was the last appeal to the people about? Was it not upon this very question ? Have we not been sent here to do this very thing? And shall we stay our hand, now that we are here? The suggestion is altogether ridiculous. We are here to do, and we are doing now, what we were sent in to do. I shall not agree to deviate one tittle from what It was proposed to do, and I am sure that not a member of this party would do so. The taxation of Crown lessees, according to the Attorney-General, is a sound principle, only to be ignored because the game is not worth the candle. I do not agree with him. I consider the game is well worth the candle, and I hope that, ere long, there will be a complementary proposal which will embrace lessees. the Northern Territory lessees? should not come under review. From what those who hold them are doing very well out of them. When the trans-continental railway comes, and the Territory is taken over, the time will be ripe for some special measure dealing with the Northern Territory lessees. I need not add that I hope this measure will pass, because, of course, there is nothing surer. I am speaking to it only because I think we owe it to the House to express our views on the subject. If the Government are not going far enough, or are going too far, and if we differ from diem, we have a right to say what we think, as men having individual opinions, and that is what I have done. [12.14] -We are getting more light on this question as the debate proceeds. When .die Prime Minister moved Ithe second reading of the Bill, he took particular pains to assure honourable members that it was a taxation proposal. No doubt, from one point of view, that was the best policy he could adopt, because he was desirous of avoiding anything that might be construed into unconstitutionality, so far as the intention of the Government was concerned.

The Attorney-General, after occupying an hour or more in dealing with the Leader of the Opposition, in his official capacity, and not as an opponent of the principles of this Bill, occupied another hour in dealing with three or four of its salient points. He said that immigration, without bursting up estates, was "" only empty babbling and a beating of the air."" He also said that no State could say, "" Here is land to go on, come and occupy it, and we will give you a hearty welcome."" He added that the shadow of this Bill had done more to promote immigration than all the other efforts put together for the past quarter of a century. He further declared that capitalists and the wealthy classes are treated better in Australia than in any other part of the world. I say that these statements are either entirely contrary to fact, or they need a very great deal of qualification. has been placed before the House by the Attorney-General, we have had a most remarkable statement-and I take it to be an exceedingly honest one, because it was uttered with a good deal of the accent of conviction-fro m the honourable member for Macquarie, who affirmed that the proposals of the Government are not drastic. If they are not drastic, I should like to know what proposals of a drastic character would be. I believe that, in speaking as he did, the honourable member represented not only his own political principles upon the land question, but those of a great many of the party to which he belongs. He said, in effect, "" Our views upon this question have been utterly misrepresented in that our opponents have declared that by means of the legislation proposed, we shall create practically a panie-that we shall cause estates to be thrown upon the market wholesale, and that we shall destroy land values. We shall do nothing of the kind. By imposing a tax of 6d. in the £ 1 , we shall be merely tickling the land-owners."" He then proceeded to indicate his own political faith upon this question. From' the beginning to the end of his speech, the idea which he conveyed was that drastic legislation would only be enacted when the whole of what he was pleased to term the "" unLater on, I earned increment ""-that is to say, not 6d. but is., in the £i-wa s appropriated by the Government and appropriated upon righteous principles. the honourable member that that is the single tax system, pure and simple, and his statement from beginning to end betrayed a complete and absolute sympathy with the principles underlying that system. Let me also add that he is mightily inconsistent. A single taxer is infinitely less lo be feared than is the honourable member, because the former when he proposes that the Government shall appropriate the unearned increment also proposes to afford the producer or land-owner corresponding relief at the Customs House. But the honourable member, whilst preaching single tax principles, is a member of an exceedingly rabid Protectionist party which desires to swamp the producer at the Customs House and then to tax his land up to the hilt. Some honourable members are perfect gluttons in the matter of taxation. The honourable member says that he was returned to this Parliament because of his But since the position political principles in this connection. His statement illustrates how very unsuspecting are the masses of the people. They do not see even a little below the-surface. In referring to the ""unearned increment"" the honourable member cited illustrations of men who have received land from the Crown at an upset price of, say, £ 1 an acre-lan d which in due course has increased in value to £ 3 , £ 4 , or £ 5 per acre. But he failed to take into account the enterprise, the capital, and the industry which have been put into that land by the individual holders, just as he has failed to take into consideration the facilities which have been offered by the State Government to create those enhanced values.

If it were parliamentary to do so, I should characterize such conduct by an appropriate term. But whilst I have no desire to transgress the Standing Orders, I intend to speak as plainly and unmistakably on this question as it is possible for me to do. I tell the honourable member for Macquarie that he must not hold up the party to which he belongs as one which represents all that is pure and virtuous on this particular question. In the matter of land gambling ancl land speculation, if there be any pitch about, the Labour party is touched with it, just as much as is any other party in Australia. I know memists, who never weary of talking about land nationalization principles, who never grow tired of explaining that the unearned increment belongs to the Crown and should be appropriated by it, but who nevertheless within the past two or three years, have been trafficking in land and making considerable sums of money in-every direction. ought to make that 'statement at the Masonic Hall. say what is true without going to the Masonic Hall to say it.

These references are provoked by the remarks of the honourable member for Macquarie, who represented the members of his party as patriots and idealists. It does not require any great courage for the Labour party to advocate a measure like that before the House, though its members are very inconsistent in advocating it. The Attorney-General upbraided the Leader of the Opposition for having once occupied a position different from that which he occumeetings influential members of the party pies now, and quoted Hansard in support of his statements. For a good many honourable members it would be a blessing were the Hansard record burned every six or twelve months. I have taken great interest in land legislation and settlement for the last fifteen or twenty years, and remember the eloquent speeches which the Attorney-General used to deliver in the New South Wales Parliament in absolute and utter condemnation of the principles embodied in this Bill. He spoke then as a land taxer, an all-round out-and-out land predict that before many years have passed taxer, and a good orthodox Free Trader. To-day he advocates different principles, and furnishes another instance of human inconsistency. I think that I am not misrepresenting members of the Labour party when I say that, at heart, they are all round land taxers. But, in proposing this legislation they are not giving effect to their political faith so much as studying political and personal considerations. able members opposite are absolutely and utterly inconsistent. Their proposals are antagonistic to the economic principles which they really hold. The honourable member for Macquarie indicated unmistakably that this measure is the beginning and not the end of land taxation, of which more will be heard. Undoubtedly, that is so.

One of them is now under offer to the Government, and one-half of another estate will be submitted for sale at public auction in about a fortnight. process of subdivision is working out so effectively and satisfactorily in the State that within a very few years there will not be a single large estate left. then. simply showing that subdivision may be effected in a legitimate way by the active authority of the State, whose sole prerogative it is. Some honourable members run away with the idea that because an estate comprises 50,000, or 60,000, or 70,000 acres, therefore it ought to be subdivided as a whole. They forget that in the case of some very valuable estates not more than a third of fhe total area is fit for the other businesses, they will tax persons who plough. On the very pick of the estates, as a rule, not more than 50 per cent, of the area can be put under the plough, because the balance is rough, hilly, stony, or in some other way utterly unfit, and always will remain unfit for cultivation, and must continue to be used for grazing purposes. Herein lies the weakness of the proposal before the House, because there can be no discrimination in these matters. Generally speaking, the other States are moving ahead in the matter of closer settlement and re-purchase for subdivision just as South Australia has done. AlthoughI do not profess to be intimately acquainted with the conditions obtaining in Victoria, yet I believe that in that State alone the Crown Lands Department can give indisputable evidence to the effect that they have been could get rid of them to applicants. They have on hand now a good many blocks belonging to estates which were purchased two years ago. The work of repurchase and subdivision has been proceeding satisfactorily and effectively, but our friends on the other side are impatient, and want to bring about this great reform in a short space of time by the application of a drastic and unnecessary remedy. If the object of this Bill is the subdivision of land and the introduction of agriculture, then why does it apply to grazing properties which never can be brought under agriculture, or to city properties, particularly to large factories employing from 500 to where can my honourable friends opposite have closer settlement more effectively carried on than in such places? By the unjust and illogical application of this principle all round, what are they doing? They Apart from this legislation, the are simply taxing production every time. Everything which impairs the efficiency of working capital is a tax on production as well as a tax on the workers. arguing that there should be no taxation at all. great difference between no taxation and taxation which amounts to confiscation in many of the grades, and which, generally speaking, can only operate as a tax on production and a burden on the people, particularly the workers. If my honourable friends are going to tax large city properties, including factories and foundries, and can pass on the impost, and will do so. But they are putting in the same category the farmer, who cannot pass on the impost. We have legislation applicable to big centres of population, in the form of heavy Customs duties. We have protection for the workers and the manufacturers, but the producers have practically no protection, while they bear practically all the burdens of taxation. My honourable friends who are led-hot Protectionists to-day are driving their little game a bit too far, and as surely as the sun shines, there will arise a solid body among the producers who will say, "" You have been riding us long enough; now we are going to get you off our backs.""

153,Mr Richard Foster,"There is aadjourned for lunch I was about to point out that this Bill, in order to preserve its constitutionality, must make no discrimination. I entirely object to this legislation at preyet one, at least, of the supporters of the sent, on the ground very clearly and explicitly stated by the honourable member for Angas, when he said that our power to impose direct taxation under the Constitution was intended to be a reserve power. That is the position I take up, and I think that honourable members, on this side of the House at all events, will agree that the intention was that the exercise of that power should be held in reserve for many years to come. I have a distinct recollection of the sittings of the Federal Convention in Adelaide. I sat out most of its meetings there, and the debates on the question of the Federal power in respect of land taxation showed that the intention of the framers of the Constitution was that land taxation should be resorted to only in case of emergency, and that the time was exceedingly remote when the land would have obligations to Federal revenue. In that, as in many other respects, the preconceived notions as to the operations of Federation were far from being correct. The power to tax implies the power to control. If we give effective power to tax, we give very effective power to control that which is taxed, and in that respect this Bill must come into serious conflict with the prerogative of the State Governments. I should far rather see the last shilling of Customs and Excise revenue appropriated directly by the Federal Government than witness an infringement of what is the absolute right of the States, and should remain for a long time to come within their own hands. I refer to the control of the lands. In this dual control -becaus e dual taxation means dual control-the best purposes of government Oy a State in the development of its own lands must be seriously hampered. The power to tax, which the Federal Government claim under this measure, is claimed by them absolutely as a power to destroy values. . No Parliament can afford to do what comes very near to the point of dishonesty, and that, in my opinion, is the position of this proposal. We have no more right to destroy the values of the wealthy man than we have to destroy the value of a poor man's cottage. We certainly nave a perfect right to make wealth recognise its obligations in respect to the development and government of the country, and there [84] are legitimate means of making it recognise those obligations. So far as I know, there is no country in the world that offers a parallel to what is proposed here; Government does not consider the Bill sufficiently drastic. A more drastic application of the principle is to come later on. Land settlement is absolutely bound up with thesubdivision of estates, the augmentation of qur population, and the encouragement of immigration, and I suppose that honourable members generally will admit that we have no better example of effective effort in that direction than is furnished by New Zealand. Some eighteen or twenty years ago New Zealand introduced this principle ancl increased the burden of taxation, so far as the gradation is concerned, in a very different way from that proposed by t.'iis Government. The New Zealand system is based on the principle that there should be no double taxation. In order to avoid twice taxing the same source of wealth, the New Zealand Parliament exempts from the income tax all wealth that is the produce of land. That is to say, land users are not taxed, first of all, by a heavy progressive land tax, and, in the second place, by an income tax upon wealth derived from land that has already been taxed. The operation of the New Zealand tax is such that the burden of the big landholder there is no greater than the burden of the big land-holder in South Australia. I offer no apology for referring extensively to South Australia, because I know the conditions obtaining here, and in the interests of this debate I hope that representatives from each of the States will afford a knowledge of what is obtaining there in order to show how this principle of taxation affects the States individually. have to pav. too. so. But the point that I was making was that although in South Australia we have a progressive land tax of only two grades as against a land tax of several grades in New Zealand, the burden of the big landholder in the Dominion is no greater than in the State from which I come. In one of the States there is no land tax in operation. No doubt that will be rectified. But the Attorney-General said yesterday that in no other country was the wealthy man so lightly dealt with as he is in Australia.

The proposals before us create a danger of jeopardizing the future producing interests of Australia. The small men who follow grazing occupations are indebted, and prepared to recognise their indebtedness, to the big pioneering flock masters. since the honourable member used to "" uppercut'' the squatters ! always spoken of the squatters as I am doing to-day, and I have always advocated common honesty.

When a member of the South Australian Parliament, I always said that I believed in a progressive land tax for revenue purhave not merely a few millions of acres poses, but that to reduce the value of any marl's land in the way now proposed was ""downright and daylight robbery.""

I have reminded honourable members that legislation, now in operation in some of the States, is in process of liberalization, and in all the States will [ 8 ] -2 4 tively dispose of this question once and for all. We have to regard this matter from a commercial as well as from a political point of view. All the lands held by pastoralists within the rainfall area, and the cream of the agricultural areas in Australia are being utilized to-day. These are way of superior stock and wool, which in volume stand at the top of our exports. It is said, however, that there should be greater utilization of such lands by subdivision. Very well; but subdivision is not our business, it is the business of the States. do it ! are doing it. In South Australia, there are not more than three big estates left, and the same process is going on elsewhere. There is something better to be done than the subdivision of large estates. The values are all now high; and it is for the Governments of the various States to go on with the utilization of the idle Crown lands, of which there are millions and millions of acres all over Australia. There is a universal demand for proper legislation in order that these areas may be settled by thousands ancl tens of thousands of people. Could immigration be promoted in a better way? Immigration is a matter which can with the co-operation of the State Governments ; and if the Commonwealth proposes to take over the entire and unreserved control of that matter, it will make a big mess of it. On the other hand, if we adopt a proper immigration policy in co-operation with the State Governments, there is room for benefit in all directions. The Attorney-General said that the present position is a poor advertisement; but it will be the very best advertisement for Australia if we can make it known that we to be subdivided in given centres, but millions and millions of acres, with most desirable conditions so far as soil, climate been waiting for years for occupation. Some of these lands are in outside sheep runs, but millions of acres nearer to centres unutilized.

170,Mr Richard Foster,"The Statesrest until possibly values come down. When I refer to the squatter I mean the holder of large estates; and I say that Re was not always in the position he is in today. I remember the time when amongst the pastoralists of Australia there were more debits than bank credits, ancl when, not many years ago, in the producing centres within the rainfall area, there were in all directions mortgages on lands occupied by both great and small holders. If a thunder-clap like this had come at such a time, it would have meant the blackest disaster to all the interests of Australia it is possible to conceive. This Bill comes before us at a time when we have good seasons, and the profits' of producing interests are at high water mark. One of the biggest factors in this prosperity is the good prices of those estates, and, at the same time, that have obtained for wheat and wool during the last few years; but if history is to repeat itself, as it will, we shall come to bedrock prices again. Possibly prices may not go so extremely low as a few years ago, but they will be considerably lower than they are to-day; and then the landholder will no longer be regarded as king. In the times I speak of the squatter was, and properly so, regarded as an object of pity. From' the national and commercial point of view we may do infinite mischief by this legislation. T remember very well, thirty or thirty-five years ago, the old cry about the squatters having possession of the ""people's grass."" That cry was raised amongst the city and town communities, and the people were prepared to take from the squatters in every direction without rhyme or reason. South Australia legislation was introduced and carried with the best possible intentions, but with the most disastrous results. Land was resumed in all directions; the plough had to go where sheep had been. But the plough went too far; we went outside the rainfall area, and, almost from the start, men, although they had a fair amount of capital, had to face inevitable ruin. After many years South Australia had to reverse her policy, and replace the plough with the grazier and the sheep. rabbits-di d they not take charge? the men who suffered know far more about rabbits, dingoes, and other troubles of that kind than do my honourable friends opposite. This Bill"" will absolutely and inevitably fail to meet the case and secure what is desired. Australia is a country subject to change in climatic conditions, and to the visitations of pests; and if in any land legislation burdens are to be placed on the people on common-sense business principles, there must be a discrimination which cannot be found in this Bill. I .shall show shortly that if the State Governments apply themselves, as they ought to do, to the settlement of their own unused Crown lands, we can leave the question of the estates of big holders to right itself under legislation which exists to-day. If this Parliament forces a penalizing tax such as the one under consideration, on all the best landed estates in Australia, simply because they are beyond a given area-becaus e that is the principle of the Bill-it will penalize unjustly the holders do the public no good, and promote no settlement. In the very best of these big estates you will not find more than 5p per cent, of land suitable for agriculture, but it is proposed to put this heavy penalty on the whole estate. If it is an estate of 50,000 acres, with 25,000 fit for agriculture, there remain 25,000 acres which have possibly belonged to the man and his family from the beginning of Australian history, and which he desires to retain. It is fit for grazing, and nothing else. Why then do the Labour party want to take it from him? Why penalize him ? If he has spent a lifetime of energy, and possibly most of the wealth that he has produced, on the development of that country, and is in a position to manage it better than any one else, why penalize In him by a Bill which has for its chief object the putting of the farmer in place of the grazier, especially when you know, beforehand that you cannot accomplish your object? This measure is going to hit very hard the inferior estates, which everybody will admit right off are undesirable for subdivision for agricultural purposes, many of them being held in freehold. There are some estates in Victoria, and in Queensland, and I know there are many in New South Wales that have been alienated from the Crown, and are held about the in fee-simple to-day, having been purchased at a price which they would barely bring now. Men had not in those days a proper idea of the real value of the estates. They got them in fee-simple, and some of them have been mortgaged. If they are not mortgaged up to the selling value to-day, I guarantee that in hundreds, if not thousands, of cases the mortgages will",38,Johnson Th E Honourable One Third Of The Acreage Is Held By The

To say that this Bill is not going to bring down values is as much as for honourable members opposite to say, if they confess what they really believe, that the Bill is going to fail in its real object. Their object is to bring down values, and the measure will bring them down enormously. What does it mean? That at the top grade a man has to pay 6d. in the jQi every year. There is half his capitalized value gone. That man is not going to continue on that land, because he will not be able to make it pay. He will get on the market as soon as he can, try to be the first in if he can, realize on the land, and put his money in Government bonds or consols. He will then have nothing to do, but his income will come in all the same. orable member cheers, but what about the development of Australia; what about the labour question? land will develop it. who buys it will have to pay for it, and will not be in so good a position to develop inferior country as the man who holds it to-day, because the present holder knows all about its capabilities, has put all the improvements there, arid is in an infinitely better position to carry out that work than ninety-nine out of every ioo men, and possibly better than the hundredth who would be likely to follow him on the land. In the name of conscience why should the Bill apply to him? It is illogical, and the Ministry cannot bring about closer settlement in those cases. When this Bill goes to the High Court, as it undoubtedly will, on constitutional grounds, is it likely that the Court will endorse a principle such as it embodies, and which is really the germ of it? The Bill is aimed at destroying the value of a man's property. I do not know anything about law, but I know something about honesty and justice, and common sense, and I hope that we have not, and never will have, in Australia a High Court that will endorse and encourage a principle such as that embodied in this Bill. One word about the stud-breeders of Australia. This question has always been recognised in South Australia by the imposition of an extremely moderate progressive tax, and we have always felt there that it would be the worse thing possible in the interests of the people to interfere with our stud-breeders, particularly of sheep and cattle. But this Bill will interfere with them. rule, have only small areas of land. estate would the honourable member think a stud-breeder would have? 3,000 acres. in South Australia a stud-breeder whose cattle and sheep 40,000 acres would not feed, but it is an almost absolute certainty that that estate will be broken up, and with it will go the finest stud herd to be found in any part of the world. bigger areas in the Northern Territor)'. can get them there. In the policy we pursued in South Australia we recognised that these 50,000 or 60,000 acre estates are not all fit for subdivision, and proposed to purchase only the portions that were fit for that purpose. It is specified in the Act that in every estate that the Government buy the owner can keep £20,000 worth alongside his homestead. The policy of South Australia was to allow that man to retain every bit of his grazing lands, so that by the retention of sufficiently large areas the stud-breeders might continue the magnificent work that they have been doing for Australia and its future in the matter of the selection and breeding of the best stock. My last point, which is one of the most important, concerns the question of immigration. This measure is held out by the Attorney-General as one that is likely to give Australia the greatest advertisement that she has ever had. He said that the very shadow of this Bill had done more for immigration than all the efforts of all the people in Australia put together for the last quarter of a century. If the shadow has done so much, what will the substance do? I am afraid the shadow will be the least harmful part of it, although it is bad enough. Instead of frightening these men half to death by the shadow, and finishing them off afterwards, it would be more merciful to kill them right off and get them out of the way, thu? avoiding any more trouble with them.

If the Government want immigration, they must co-operate with the State Governments ic the opening up and use of their unutilized lands. There is room enough in that direction for the bringing of immigrants to Australia, and profitably employing them for the next half-a-century in nearly every State. Good as subdivision and closer settlement are, and excellent as have been the results that have followed the re-purchasing and settling of many of our lands in the estates near big centres, there is an infinitely better future for the opening up of the unused Crown lands. More has been done in the last three or four years in some of the States in the way of land settlement and increasing the agricultural population in that way than under all the re-purchase schemes in all the States of Australia. In South Australia there are not more than three big estates left, but although we have done a good deal in that State in the direction of re-purchase ancl subdivision, we have done infinitely more during the same period in settling our unoccupied Crown lands, under happy and promising conditions. In one district alone-the honourable member for Grey can endorse ihisthat policy will very soon have settled as many people as have been settledby the whole of the re-purchase in South Australia. VVe have settled people on lani that ten or fifteen years ago was thought to be unfit for settlement, and had been lying unoccupied for fifteen or twenty years. Because some people got in and secured the land at practically a peppercorn rental, there is to-day a great hue and cry. Those lands could have been leased by anybody, but they went a-begging year after year; yet to-day there is more settlement on them than all our re-purchaie and closer settlement policies put together have brought about. into operation there will be more still. more now, without this tax. What is needed is development on common-sense commercial lines, and that is what I want the Australian people to substitute for this iniquitous and unjustifiable proposal. In addition to the district in South Australia to which I referred, there is, I suppose, 3;ooo,ooo acres more of suitable soil, with a good climate and an assured rainfall, in process of survey or settlement, or waiting to be surveyed. That land can be profitably used under the newer and more advanced principles of cultivation, by the employment of fertilizers, and, in some districts, dry farming. If we bring in the principle of dry farming we have millions of acres more to which it can be applied; but I am speaking now of lands which have an assured rainfall. They will give a really good crop without the application of dry farming. If we admit that principle, all those areas in South Australia which were once under the plough and turned out a failure, and are now under sheep, will come back to the plough again. If we can treat them as similar areas have been treated with such magnificent results in> America, we have in our State untold possibilities for the settlement of people. The only thing that is wanted is to bring to the land the idle hands of other parts of the world, where people live under less enviable conditions than those which obtain in Australia. This scheme can be worked out only by the National Government, in co-operation with the State Governments, and what applies to South Australia applies to other States; but infinitely more to three in particular. Where we in South Australia have a few million acres of such country, New South Wales has her 20,000,000 acres and more; and what New South Wales has, Queensland has also, in bigger areas still. There are many million acres more in Western Australia than the other States can show of land which offers inducements for successful settlement.; These empty spaces must be filled up. But it is an appeal to the selfishness of human nature to tell our young men that they need not go out to the back-blocks, because they can get through the . fence into their neighbour's land. They will have an infinitely better future in the back country than on any of the re-purchased land. They will have before them the pioneering life, and the example of the pioneers whose determination and industry have made Australia what it is. They may not win prizes quite equal 1 to some obtained by the early pioneers, but they will win exceedingly good prizes. For those who go out as pioneers, whether they be Australian-born or immigrants from the Old Land, there are prizes to be won infinitely better than are to be obtained in> any other part of the world.

I rise to speak on this subject, not because I feel that I can add anything to what has been so ably said by those who have preceded me, but because I regard it as my duty to those who sent me here to say why I am in accord with, and intend to support, the very fine measure which the Government has placed before the House. At the outset, I congratulate Ministers, not only for their attempt to give effect to principles in which we have always believed, but also because of the method in which expression is given to'those principles. In considering this subject, we have two questions .to ask : first, is the principle of taxing unsquare mile, and with the control of immiimproved land values sound, affording a just means of raising revenue, and, secondly, will the imposition of such taxation be harmful or beneficial to the community ? The Government, being charged with the administration of the affairs of the .country and its defence, is justified in saying to the owners of land that they must contribute to the support of the public services ; but Ave must show that the principle of this taxation is just, and that its effects, though far-reaching, will be absolutely beneficial. The Leader of the Opposition, who has moved an amendment on the motion of the Prime Minister, com^ plains that the Bill is an abuse of Federal power, and opposed to the spirit of the Constitution, but, the spirit of the Constit|ution, properly interpreted, means that which is in consonance with the wishes of the people. Proposals for land taxation have been before the country for many years, and were a leading theme during the last election campaign. Minister, earlier in the session, was twitted by the Leader of the Opposition for not making a Land Tax Bill his first measure. We told the country that .a Land Tax Bill would be one of the first measures introduced, and every member ; of our party advocated land taxation throughout the length and breadth of Australia. said very little about it in some places. throughout Australia. I represent as many land-holders in proportion to the size of my electorate as does any honourable member, and, although I made the land tax a leading feature of my addresses, I was returned by a pretty substantial majority. It would not be becoming to boast of the majority I got, but the 2,000 votes by which my support exceeded that of my rival were cast principally by small land-owners. I find that there are in this House, representing country constituencies, and mostly small farmers, twenty-three Labour members and only thirteen Oppositionists. The honourable member for Ballarat claims that the Bill is an abuse of Federal power. Let us examine that statement. This Parliament is charged with the making of preparations for the defence of a vast continent, which has a population of only one and a-quarter persons to the gration. These two most important matters are wrapped up in the question of land settlement. Until land monopoly is abolished, and we can say to those in other parts of the world that land is available for them to settle on, nothing that we can do for immigration or defence will be of any effect. The proper distribution of land must precede all arrangements for immigration and defence. Land settlement is the basis of prosperity, and this measure, by forcing the large land-owners to use their land, or to pell it, will do much to bring it about. The Attorney-General showed plainly that the Leader of the Opposition has not always been of his present opinion, but with that I am not concerned. I do not care to know what were his opinions at some other time. I am merely concerned in pointing out now that the arguments which were used yesterday to show that this measure is an abuse of Federal power could be applied to any measure for imposing a land tax. Had the honourable Indeed, the Prime gentleman confined himself to the argument that the Bill should not be passed, because its interference with the rights of the States is an abuse of Federal power, there would have been, at least, consistency in his position. But his arguments would apply .against all land luxation. One was that the imposition of the proposed",41,Johnson Th E Honourable One Third Of The Acreage Is Held By The

187,Mr Scullin,"We advocated ittax would depreciate the value of land, and another that it would create injustice and hardship. He endeavoured to show that the cases of hardship to which he referred would be caused by the Commonwealth not having power to discriminate, but he failed to show that the States would be able to so discriminate as to prevent them. We heard about arid wastes, about the men on poor land, and about fhe land that was tied up; but by no discrimination could the State Parliaments prevent such hardships as he referred to. pose to discriminate? later. We have heard for many years that the imposition of a land tax will depreciate the value of land. That was a special point made by my opponent during the Federal campaign. But at a sale which has occurred in the district since the Labour Government took office, and since it became certain that a land tax would be introduced early in the session, the prices realized were the highest ever known. What is that said to be due to? Labour Government. because the Labour Government is in power, farmers have to pay high prices for the land which they need to earn their living. Therefore, we are blamed whatever happens. Those who are opposed to this taxation say that if the income derived from land is reduced by the amount of the tax, the capital value of the land will be reduced by the capitalized value of the tax. That is sound reasoning so far as it goes, but honourable members forget some of the important effects of fhe measure, one of which will be the breaking up of large estates, the settling of greater numbers on the soil, and the opening up of new avenues of employment to workers generally, which will greatly increase the prosperity of the country. The subdivision of large estates has taken place in anticipation of the imposition of this tax. Let me show what land taxation has done in New Zealand. I quote from page 557 of the New Zealand Year-Book for 1909. When, in 1891, a tax was imposed on the unimproved value of land in New Zealand, the value was estimated at £75,832,465, and in 1909 it had risen to £172,759,948, an increase of £97,000,000, the increase in the value of improvements being very little. I do not say that the imposition of. the tax alone brought about that increase in the unimproved value of the land of the country. A land tax will take from land its inflated value, which is one of its good features. When that is done, when settlers can get on the lancl at its real value, the large estates will be broken up. The farmer will then get to work turning up the soil with the plough, and we shall have little towns springing up in what are at present the waste places of Australia. Prosperity will follow, and the values of land and everything else will go up. That has been the experience of land taxation in New Zealand. When we are charged with thedefence of a continent such as this, why should we be met with the argument that we have no power to do the only thing essential to make defence possible? We are asked to trust to the State Parliaments to do their duty in this regard. The very honourable members who make that appeal to us are those who did nothing during all the years that they were in the Slate Parliaments. We have had presented to confidence in the us the argument of the Treasurer of Victoria, who, in introducing his ""excellent Land Tax Bill, said to the State Legislature, "" If we do not put on a land tax the Federal Parliament will."" The State Parliament did not impose that tax. The Upper House-the House of landlordsthrew cut the Bill, and we have now to do thai which the States have refused to dp. Turning again to the honourable member for Ballarat, I would remind him of a very important point. I recognise that we have to review these matters from a broad national stand-point, but at the same time. I feel that if there is any special obligation, apart from that, upon every honourable member, it is that of looking to the interests of his own constituency. I take the honourable member for Ballarat to that golden city whicli has been one of the finest inland cities of Australia, and point out to him that it was built up by the mining industry, ancl maintained by the rich arable lands of the district. The mining industry is languishing away, and another primary industry has to keep it going. The people of Ballarat are looking to the rich lands, locked up in the district, to help to maintain its position, and I charge him to do his duty to the constituency which gave him Federal political birth. I charge him to do something here, where his vote will count, because, in",42,Johnson Th E Honourable One Third Of The Acreage Is Held By The

It is said that and then go on to say, "" There are millions the Labour party in the State Parliaments would favour a smallei exemption than one of £5,000. Why do we propose this exemption ? The honourable member for Wakefield, who has just resumed his seat, said that we were paltering with this question ; that we were hypocrities, and lhat we proposed an exemption of £5,000, so as to secure the farmers' vote. I claim, as one who believes in the principle of land lancl in the taxation-as one who believes that a portion of the value which has been created by the community, should be taken by the community to maintain the services that the community has created-that we should not be justified in saying that we will take the last fraction from the small users of land unless we could at the same time say to them, "" We shall remit some form of taxation now pressing heavily upon you.""

The Leader of the Opposition, when speaking yesterday, referred to my constituency. There, he said, there were some lands worth £100 an acre. or 60 acres of such lands, he declared, would have to pay this tax. I do not see much force in ""that argument. The owner of 50 or 60 acres of land worth £100 an acre-and there are very few acres of land worth as much-would be regarded as a very fortunate individual. Leader of the Opposition quoted an exaggerated value, and in reply I would point out that the holder of 50 or 60 acres of land worth £100 an acre is often better off than is the owner of 1,000 acres worth £5 or £6 per acre in another part of the Commonwealth. The honourable gentleman said that we have no power to discriminate between rich and poor lands. fact that we impose this tax at the rate of so much in thc ,£1, or, in other words, tax the value, instead of the area, of the land, shows that we are discriminating between rich and poor areas. The owner of land worth £5 per acre will pay more per acre than the holder of an esMr Scullin. tate worth £ 1 per acre, and conIs it not a fact that those seqently the argument that we have no power to discriminate goes by the board. If we The Leader of the Opposition lost sight of another point. Very few -farmers in my electorate hold 50 or 60 acres of land worth £100 per acre. Those who do own such farms have upon them improvements to the extent of £2,000 or £3,000. Those improvements are included in the total value of £100 per acre, so that when we deduct the value of the improvements and the exemption of £5,000, the holdei We of a farm worth £8,000 or £9,000 will have to pay very little taxation. He will pay at the rate of only one penny in the £ 1 on the unimproved value after the exemption of £5,000 has been made. He will have nothing to complain of in that respect, but he will have the satisfaction But since we in the of knowing that the sons and daughters he is rearing will have an opportunity to obtain a piece of land and settle upon it as he has done. That is the strongest argument in favour of this tax, and it explains why men in our constituencies, who will have to pay this tax, yet voted solidly for the Labour party, hoping that their children and their children's children would, There must be a as the result of this tax, be placed ori We land now devoted to sheep-grazing or remaining in idleness. We have been told that the squatters have made the country, and in that connection I would point out that a division of grazing lands is both possible and practicable. If we go to the Men holding 50 northern and north-western parts of Victoria, as well as to other districts where the land is said to be fit only for grazing, we find holdings of 3,000 or 4,000 acres producing proportionately two or three times as many sheep as are the large squatters. We find the squatter's land overrun with The rabbits, as the honourable member for Fawkner interjected some time ago, and I would remind him that closer settlement is the only remedy for the rabbit pest. We find large estates of 40,000 or 50,000 acres overrun with rabbits, thistles, or bracken fern, and covered with dead timber or growing scrub. Let that land be cut up into areas of from 4,000 to 5,000 acres, The very and those who go upon it will enclose it with wire-netting fences. They will destroy the rabbits, burn off the timber or bracken, and produce twice as many sheep as the squatter does in respect of the same area. The honourable member for Wakefield has referred to the wool clip and to our topping the market. I invite him to compare the wool clip and the number of able now, we should not only have more sheep running on the Wimmera at the prewheat and other products, but more wool. sent time with the position when the squatI have taken the Victorian Year-Book, the ters were in absolute possession.

201,Mr Scullin,"Quite so. In the old there could not' be uniformity. But themyself. In my own electorate, there are estates, for portions of which men have offered £ 2 an acre rent over a term of years, and have formed themselves into a little syndicate to cultivate onions on 100 to 200 acres, undertaking to fence and make other improvements, and the offer has been. refused, though the land was raising less than one sheep to the acre. On the opposite side of the railway,' in the same district, £ 1 ios. per acre has been offered as rent, and refused, although, as in the other case, the land was not running one sheep to the acre. their bumps read! able members will regard these cases as "" a bit too thin,"" but I am not here to give reasons for what may be regarded as silly conduct, simply to state the facts. The only explanation I can suggest is that the owners have the same stupid notion of holding broad acres, and keeping tenants off, as large land-owners have in the Old Country -suc h as the Duke of Sutherland, who burnt the farm-houses on his estate, sent the people adrift, making a deer park of the land. We have a similar evil in Australia to-day; and this land tax will prove sufficient to make a change in that stupid policy. The honourable member for Ballarat told us, and thought it was a strong point, that this tax will result in some having to pay 75 per cent, of their income. Now, if anything were wanted to show the necessity for the tax, it is the fact that it may have such a result, because that is an admission that the large land-owners are leaving their land in comparative idleness, simply»adopting a "" dog in the manger "" attitude. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -That only applies to the very poorest land. the best land in Australia. In my own electorate some of the richest areas are not yet cut up, while some estates have been subdivided only since the advent of the Labour Government. People are sent away into the bush to pioneer in order to "" keep off the corns "" of the rich landowner ; and this is to be seen in every part of the States. I can speak, at any rate, for Victoria, because I have travelled over the whole of the State more than once. The honourable member for Wakefield asked what could be better than to send our young men to the back blocks; but I wish I could take him into the Otway Forest and other places, and show him, not only the yOung men. but their wives and children, living and being brought up far distant from religious influences, schools, and all that makes life worth living. ThenI should like to show the honourable member rich fertile areas in the Western District with hardly a tree and hardly a home, occupied only by sheep. If anything has to be sent to the back-blocks, let it be the sheep, so that' human beings may occupy the better places. We are told that there is plenty ot land available; but, if that is so, what lunatics our farmers and farmers' sons must be. If we go into any agricultural district and ask the people where their boys are, we are told that they have gone to seek jobs in the city. I know of one place from which nearly all the young men, big, strong, strapping fellows, found their way Into the police force. It may be said that these young men prefer city life, but my experience, and that of others, is that the vast majority of those born on the land love the land, and would be glad of a little farm to till. Their parents cannot subdivide their small holdings; and thus the drain to the city goes on year after year. These young men are not wasters, most of them have a little capital, and would be prepared to find the plant, but they cannot find the land. On the fringe of the Mallee, on the Mildura line, the Victorian Government threw open eighty blocks, and for weeks before the Land Board sat, the roads for miles around were covered with the tents and waggons of the 1,200 applicants for those eighty blocks. Every time, there is a land sale bidding is keen, and I have not known a sale in the southern part of Victoria where the prices have not been higher than the real values. All this shows an intense land hunger. Young men are clearing out to Queensland, and pioneering under bad circumstances, while only 4,000,000 acres out of the 28,000,000 acres alienated in Victoria are under the plough, and some of our best land is absolutely idle. Th'e honourable member for Wakefield said that it was the duty of the States to impose land taxation; but it is an old game, when you do not approve of a measure, to urge that it is. some one else's duty; and we know that the States have failed to impose land taxesin the past.",46,Johnson Th E Honourable One Third Of The Acreage Is Held By The

The honourable member does not know what he is talking about when he slanders Western Australian land in that way. Western Australian land, but am speaking generally. The land unsettled and unalienated in the majority of the parts of Australia is either inaccessible or unsuitable for settlement. regards Western Australia. The early squatters picked out the eyes of every State. I will admit that Western Australia is the newer State; we only heard of her a few years ago. Perhaps we have to learn a lot more about her, and I hope we shall hear more of her in the future. But it must be remembered that all these millions of acres, even if they are suited for settlement, must be provided with railway facilities before they are worth anything to the average settler ment had to buy estates back. best test of the matter is that men are paying such high prices whenever there is a land sale. That proves that they cannot get cheap land anywhere else, or they would not pay those prices. The men who are settling on the land are just as keen business men as is any honourable member sitting opposite. Many of them have travelled the whole of Australia. I could name scores who have done so, but have come back to Victoria and paid high prices for land, not because they liked paying for them, but because they were forced to in order to get what they required. We are not opposed to immigration, but we say that this tax must precede any settled policy of immigration. It must break up the large estates in our wellwatered and settled districts, and before we ask the people to pioneer back in the waste ancl arid districts we should settle the lands near our cities, close to civilization, with a good rainfall, and in touch with railways. For these reasons I support the measure, and commend it to the House as the most progressive ever introduced in any part of Australia. I recommend it as laying the foundation of a great policy, and as fraught with great possibilities for the defence of this country. I am confident that it will bring in an era of prosperity that will make Australia a truly great nation. The object of the Bill now before the House is very laudable, if we are to judge by the memorandum which preceded the Land Tax Assessment Bill, a very similar measure, introduced by the same Government last session. That document begins by saying1 A population sufficiently large to effectively develop its various resources and defend it from invasion is essential to the progress and even the very existence of every country. While this is true of all countries, it is particularly true of Australia. No land has greater natural resources; none, by reason of geographical situation or by the enormous extent of its coast-line, is so vulnerable to attack. I think all sides of the House are agreed as to the desirability of settling a great population on the land. Where we disagree is as to whether this is the proper method of doing it. I have favoured a land tax, if it is required, but I wish to say straight away that it ought to be in the hands of the State Governments. I would direct the attention of honourable members to a map that I have had prepared. On it are drawn to scale red portions indicating the amount of land alienated, and in course of alienation, the other portions representing the Crown lands. The state of things which exists in Victoria cannot be compared with that in Western Australia. To try to deal with those two States under one measure is to bring about the very grave position which is emphasized in the Bill now before us. evidently think that Victoria is Australia. ' thought that New South Wales was Australia, and Sir Henry Parkes actually at one time proposed to call it Australia. I want to call honourable members' attention to the state of things as shown on that map, to illustrate how widely different are the conditions existing in the different States. We are all inclined to grumble at the slow rate of progress of population in Australia, but I was surprised to read the other day in a lecture by Professor Gregory, printed in the Geogra'p/iical Journal for June last, that our rate of increase has not been slow compared with that of other countries..

Australia was practically empty when the British colonists first arrived there, and they naturally settled on the well-watered temperate country in the south-eastern quarter, and thence they have gradually spread northward and westward.

That was to me an astonishing discovery.

Had the Labour party told the electors that the Bill would ruin a great number of people, because it would be impossible to discriminate in favour of those holding poor lands distant from railway communication, there would have been no mandate for the imposition of the tax. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -Does the honourable member think that the Bill will ruin any one ? two instances to show that there are cases in which it will bring about absolute ruin, and on Thursday next, when the Prime Minister is to receive a deputation, it will be shown that the Bill will bring ruin to thousands. members will not force the measure through without considering these objections. As a rule, the purchaser of land expects to make about 5 per cent, from it, and is generally not able to pay in cash the whole amount of the purchase' money, borrowing perhaps half, or 60 per cent., of it on mortgage. Such a man pays 2 per cent, L of his total returns to the mortgagee, and if the Government takes the other half he will have nothing. There are hundreds of cases of that kind. There is something to be said for the position that the owners of land should pay for the protection of their property. The honourable member for Coolgardie put that very plainly, and I thought there was a good deal in what he said; but such contributions should be levied in the form of a tax on all property, and should not take the shape of confiscation. The present proposal in many cases amounts to a statement of this kind : ""We to prevent you from losing it by reason of the invasion of a foreign foe."" It is like shooting a man to prevent him from being killed in war. No doubt the land-owners would rather run the risk of war than give up their land altogether. I shall not touch on the constitutional aspect of this question, because it has been dealt with at great length by persons who are better able to deal with it than I am; but there is something in the point that the Constitution does not permit this Parliament to discriminate between State and State,' or between one part of a State and another. I am certain that it was never thought, prior to Federation, that the Federal Parliament would levy a land tax, except in a national emergency. never have joined the Union had there been the least idea that a land tax of this kind would be proposed. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -There would have been no Federation had the electoral results been foreseen. were opposed to Federation until they saw the advantages which their party could gain under it. I , on the other hand, have always befin in favour of it. The Federal Government was given the Customs ancl Excise revenue with which to meet the ex-penses of Federation.

But honourable, member:, opposite say that it is their business to control the nation's destiny, and I feel certain that honourable that, as the lands of the country are not being settled fast enough, they will step in. There is a proverb to the effect that a certain class of persons "" rush in where angels fear to tread.""

As estates worth less than £5,000 are to be exempt from the proposed taxation, we must leave out of our calculation holdings of less than 1,751 acres. an area ranging from 1,751 to 2,000 acres is 617,149, and, if taxed as proposed, they would produce the sum of £764 18s. 4d. All the holdings are known in New South Wales, and we cannot get away from the ? figures. The actual figures are put befor* us. We have the areas to be dealt with, the unimproved value under the New South Wales Act, and the number of holdings are correctly set out.

I have carefully studied the figures, and I do not think that they can be contradicted.

I refer to the holders of poor lands, far removed from railway communication, and those whose, lands are heavily mortgaged. They will bear the burden of this ' taxation. In order that they may realize the difficulty of dealing with this question from a Federal stand-point, I invite honourable members to look at the map (hat I have had exhibited in the Chamber. They will learn from it that only 2\ per cent, of the lands of Western Australia, have been alienated. That State is eleven times larger than Victoria, 49-72 P cent, of whose lands have been alienated. Victoria has received £ 3 , 3 ; 9 2 J 6 8 I l o m t n e sale of its lands, and it is but one-seventh of the size of Queensland, which has derived only £8,687,814 from the sale of its lands. If the sales of Crown lands in Queensland had been, in proportion to its size, on the same basis as those of Victoria, the northern State would have obtained from that source something like The acreage of holdings of £226,000,000. wanted to sell it, but you chaps would not buy it. c we could afford to purchase, and we have not had any unearned increment. This tax is supposed to be levied upon the unearned increment, and in this connection I should like to quote the honourable member for Corangamite, who is a typical example of the energetic land taxer. He represents a constituency where the congestion of land has been most severely felt. It is the richest district in Victoria, and the honourable member, who is undoubtedly an unqualified land taxer, said, on a former occasion, in regard to this taxIt carries into effect a policy which for many years past we have advocated throughout the country. That is a lax on land values with an exemption of £5,000. Now, the first thing that this tax does is to declare the right of the people of this country to take a portion of the unearned increment to pay for the services rendered by the people who have created those values. what is the honourable member quoting? Hansard. The honourable member for Corangamite said that his view of this land tax was that it was to enable the country to take a portion of the unearned increment for the services of government. This Bill does not provide for that. It will tax not merely the unearned increment, but the amount which a man has paid the Government in the first instance for his land. If that amount were exempt, then, as the honourable member for Angas pointed out, a great injustice would be avoided. It seems hard, to say the least, that a man should be taxed on the £ 1 per acre, or more, that he has actually paid the Government for his lancl. The argument in support of this tax has been from the first that the mandate from the country was that the unearned increment should be taxed, and to a tax on those lines no very serious objection could be er taken. I am sure, however, that there was no mandate from the country to tax a man on the amount that he has actually paid",51,Johnson Th E Honourable One Third Of The Acreage Is Held By The

A great many people entertain the idea that very little has been paid for the land that has been alienated. cludes rents in that amount. member means rents paid in respect of conditional purchases, I do, for they are in the shape of annual instalments of the actual purchase money. A fact that is not clearly recognised is that the land-owners of Australia, for the right to occupy their land, have paid the enormous sum that 1 have mentioned. It is often claimed that land-owners have had railways constructed to or through their property, and that they ought to share with the community the increased profits they have made as the result of securing those raihvay facilities. The railways of Australia have cost only £140.000,000, and of that amount £113,628,777 was actually provided from the sale of lands. keep, as well as interest on capital, is met Government did not receive any money for by the revenue derived from the produce of the land that is carried over our railways. I understand that the railways of Australia to-day are paying sound interest on the cost ot construction. These facts have not been taken into account, and in that respect the Bill does not carry out the mandate of the people. The Government are not only taxing the unearned increment, which the honourable member for Corangamite said was the best of all methods of raising revenue, but they are actually proposing to tax every £ 1 which the landowner has paid to the Government of his country. That, to my mind, amounts to repudiation. If the Government enter into a contract with a man to take , £ i an acre for their land, and, having sold it, practically take the value of that £ 1 away from him, that certainly savours of repudiation. case for some consideration to owners of property remote from railway communication, and which can never be devoted to closer settlement. This measure should be accompanied by some re-purchase scheme. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -That is a State matter has a re-purchase scheme in force, and I think they are all working very well. That table shows that the landThose who have paid over £113,000,000 for their land are surely entitled to some consideration. Many of them will find it impossible to dispose of their properties. It is impossible to cut up many of the large estates; but the man who can sell his land to-morrow in small areas, and the man who cannot possibly do so, and who must, therefore, be ruined, are both treated alike. If we were to exempt from taxation the price originally paid, we should do the right thing. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -What is the value to-day of the properties for which £113,000,000 was paid? affect my argument, because the difference between the original and the present day values represents the unearned increment, and objection could not be taken to a just tax upon that unearned increment. To tax people on what they have had to pay, however, will amount to repudiation. Let me contrast this system with that in force in New Zealand, where the Government, at the outset, obtained very little from the sale of their lands. A great deal of the land originally belonged to the Maoris, and the it. On the other hand, the lands of Australia belonged to the Crown, and the Government received every penny piece that was paid by the first pioneers for the occupation of the land. Nevertheless, New Zealand has re-purchased .£4,807,369 worth of land; whereas in Australia, with over £113,000,000 paid for land, the total area repurchased has been under £6,000,000 worth. This measure ought to be accompanied by a repurchase scheme, so that a man may be able to come to the Government and get what he originally paid for the land, together with the price of his improvements. Considering the relative sizes of the countries, Australia has done very little more than New Zealand in the way of the repurchase. I do not desire to weary the House with a great number of cases, because all of them will be brought There is the strongest possible before the Prime Minister on Thursday, when he will meet a deputation that is very anxious to see him.

Further indication of what is being done in closer settlement by private enterprise in other States is found in the accompanying list of station properties within easy driving distance of only honourable way to deal with them is Corowa, in the Riverina district, which have been recently subdivided, or are now in process of subdivision.

When it is realized, and especially if the Government give facilities in the form of railway construction, honourable members will find land tax to make settlement go ahead. After all, there are, nowadays, very few landowners who do not feel keenly that it is their duty to help settlement along in order to defend this land of ours, and to keep it white by holding it for the great British race. I hope there are next to none of them left, but if there are any, and if they are obstructing settlement, the proper and to buy them out.

If he does not care to pay a special tax, he can either come here to live, or sell his land and take the money he gets for it elsewhere. But there are not many such men.

That left us with money due to us to the amount of £347,000, against which we held the properties which are now in the possession of the Melbourne Real Estate 'Company. These properties, as I have said, produce us at the present time a revenue of £4,300 a year.

This measure will absolutely kill the company. have given a great deal of employment, and done a great deal of good, and we ought not to penalize it. I ask honourable members to listen to another case. This is an account of the operations of a company which started here in 1884, and in 1894 had to increase its capital. locally, but was transferred to England. The extra capital was raised to pay off charges on stations, &c, and it could only be obtained in London by technically domiciling the company there. It is a commercial fact that a company which has its head office in London can raise money more cheaply than a company whose head office is elsewhere. The debentures of the company amount to £2,450,000. is £1,250,000, so that it has been employing in its business altogether £3,700,000. Over 1,000,000 sheep belonging to the company died during the great drought which culminated in 1902, and the company has not paid dividends°for fifteen years. Last year it wrote off ,£'837,767 of capital. Technically, the company is an absentee one, though the whole of its business is done in the Commonwealth, and the proposed tax will come to 5 per cent, on its total capital. not paid dividends due to bad management? company myself for a long while, so that I know that it is not. During the drought in which the company lost 1,000,000 sheep, the number of sheep in Queensland was reduced from 21,000,000 to 7,000,000. The whole of the land belonging to the company was acquired as mortgagee-in-possession, the way-back stations which have been spoken of, where the drought was most severe, falling into its hands. It was an investing company, and did not wish to own land, and for' some years past it has been trying to dispose of its properties. In five years it has sold ,£150,000 worth of land to small men,financingthem, and taking long terms for payment. Those who benefit from the operations of the company are its employees. The company is 0 1 t n e spending £187,000 on those engaged in looking after its stations and managing its business. It has large warehouses in Melbourne. Sydney, Brisbane, Rockhampton, and Townsville. Its sugar estates have The company's operations here been cut up and sold on terms to farmers. In short, the company has done everything to push business; but under the Bill it will be treated as an absentee company, and charged extra taxation, and thc remainder of its capital will have to be written off if the Bill is passed as it stands, in which case its estates will fall into the hands of debenture-holders. I direct the attention of honourable members to these cases, which are typical of a great many others. I am certain that they do not wish to do hardship, It is said that the troubles of Ireland are greatly due to absenteeism, and we do not desire that those who make their money here should live abroad; but that is not a reason for inflicting injustice on British investors who have lent money here at low rates of interest, and have acquired properIts capital ties through mortgagors being unable to meet their obligations.

In conclusion, I wish only to refer to the moral view of this tax. reference was made to it by Sir Henry Wrixon, in a very able letter which he published in the Argus a little while ago. He admitted at once that a tax was absolutely justifiable, that every sort of property was well able to bear a tax; but he contended tliat in imposing a tax on the unearned increment, as well as on the amount that had actually been paid for the right to use thc land, we should overstep the bounds of fair dealing as between man and man. T am sure that honourable members opposite do not wish to do that. I am satisfied that they desire to give every one, so to speak, a fair deal j but, flushed as they are with their recent victory, they have, in their enthusiasm, done more than they intended to do. I am confident that the hard cases which will be brought under their notice during the next few clays will cause some of their opinions to be "" mellowed down.""' It is the common belief of residents of cities and towns that the man in the country has a splendid time. The people of our cities think that the grass grows by the act of God, and that the farmer and pastoralist have only to sit down and rest while the wool grows. not go on the land. shareof life on the land. At the outset I lived in the bush for seven years, and rarely came to town. The point at issue, however, is not so much what I have done, as what honourable members of the Labour party are doing. City residents, as I have said, are disposed to greatly exaggerate the prosperity that comes from the land, and do not readily recognise that no other classes of investment suffer such serious rebuffs as do investments in land. While it was the mandate of the constituencies that some class of land tax should be imposed, I do not think that any great body of people in Australia ever contemplated the introduction of such a drastic measure as that now before us. I trust that upon reflection honourable members opposite will recognise that many land-holders, particularly owners of poor, indifferent land in remote parts of the Commonwealth, and those whose properties, whether in town or country, are heavily mortgaged, I am glad that the Queensland are deserving of some consideration. Unless consideration is extended to them, many people will be absolutely ruined. I am sure that is not the spirit in which this measure is brought before us. that encouraging cheer from the Minister of Home Affairs, and confidently expect that some modification of this exceedingly drastic measure will be agreed to. [5.19J -On e cannot help being struck by the extraordinary reticence of honourable members on the Ministerial side of the House, and the remarkable lack of interest which they manifest, judging by the state of the Treasury bencli, in a debate that is of paramount importance to the whole community. I can only conjecture that the reason for it is to be found in the difficulty that many honourable members opposite have in reconciling the measure now before us with their platform declarations as to thc policy underlying their land tax proposals. I propose to address myself, not to the motion for the second reading of the Bill, but rather to the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition and all that it embraces. I have a reason for that, because I wish, a little later on, to move an amendment which I should be precluded from doing if I discussed the ' motion for the second reading. would again remind the honourable member that there is no justification for such a remark, since there has been no attempt at obstruction on the part of the Opposition.

We were called upon this week to consent to additional sitting hours, in order to push on with legislation, and yet already there is being exhibited on the Ministerial side of the House a tired feeling, which augurs ill for the speedy transaction of business. The progressive land tax proposals of the Labour party furnish evidence of the fact to which I have often alluded-that the Labour party of to-day is no longer a party of principle, but merely a party of expediency. ' There is no guiding principle underlying its programme. That programme is changed every year, and before twelve months have passed, the basis of the land taxation now proposed may be relegated to the limbo of the forgotten and unhallowed past, and some other scheme substituted for it. also impresses upon us the fact that the Labour party itself cannot claim to be in any sense a people's party. It is simply a class party. Its legislation is purely on class lines, and it substitutes one form of class legislation for another class, which in remote days, unfortunately, did exist. This measure is based on a recognition of class aims, and not upon a recognition of the principles of justice, which should be the corner-stone and foundation of all legislation. As soon as we depart from those sound principles of justice, balancing the claims of every individual in the community equally in the sight of the law, and give privileges to one class at the expense of the rest of the community, we lay up for ourselves, as legislators, a great store of future trouble. It is because I am anxious to avoid that sort of thing that I earnestly' ask honourable members to remember that we should come into this Chamber prepared to legislate equally in the interests of every section of the community. We should not set up one against another. We should not penalize one class for the advanI was tage of another, nor discriminate between any sets of individuals in the community. Unfortunately, principle seems to have been abandoned by the Labour party for the sake of expediency. In following the debates at the more recent Labour Conferences, I have been forced to the conclusion that, year by year, the interest of the all events, great masses of the community, resting upon some recognised basic principle, is not the guiding motive operating in the deliberations of that party, which, by the way, wrongly arrogates to itself the title of the "" Labour party."" We may find an explanation in the words used at the Conference of 1905 by Mr Holman, Deputy Leader of the Labour party in the New South Wales Parliament. Principles were then being discussed, and certain of the Labour delegates, more honest than their leaders, wished principles instead of expedients to be recognised. But Mr Holman, with that experience and astuteness which, I suppose, he had acquired as a politician in association with other politicians, found his former zeal as a reformer tempered by the fear of unpopularity with the rural constituents of his party, and so reminded them that I t is not easy to go as sheep amongst wolves; and they should consider what would be their fate in regard to some eight or ten wavering seats, which they should carefully look to. Here we have a reason for the departure The character of this legislation from principle. The land value taxation originally appearing in the New South Wales Labour platform contained no exemptions. The tax was to apply to every land-owner, and the first subsequent Conference declared absolutely against exemptions, but this did not suit the politicians who at a subsequent Labour Conference to which I have just referred, declared that the reason for the abandonment of that principle was that it was more necessary to get votes than to stand by principles. When it was a question of principle versus votes, principle had to go by the board.

I have never swerved a hair's breadth from the principles therein laid down; 1 do not repudiate a single line, sentence, word, or even comma, in the whole of that plank. It was a proposal, not to superimpose land value taxation on existing taxation, but to substitute the former for the latter. On 24th November, 1891, the Sydney Daily Telegraph, in the course of a leading article, had tiiis significant referenceWhen the programme of the Labour Electoral League was adopted as the political faith of the Labour bodies of this Colony, we pointed to the fact that the only expression of opinion with regard to taxation which it contained leaned in the direction of absolute Free Trade.

These were the two basic principles of their land tax proposals. I merely propose to deal with the pression of opinion twenty years ago. more than an expression of opinion.

302,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"I amto say on the matter to which I am referring. When the New South Wales Parliament was dealing with the question of land value taxation, a decision had been arrived at during a previous. Labour league conference, that there was to be no exemption. a member of that Parliament; and when it was proposed to introduce the principle of exemption, what did he say ? The honourable gentleman, who is now the arch-champion of an exemption of £5,000, and twits honourable members on this side with inconsistency. He has quoted copiously from speeches made by the Leader of the Opposition in the earlier stages of his political career; but what did he himself say, as reported in the New South Wales Hansard of 7th March, 1895, page 4239? In the course of a somewhat lengthy speech he saidAs one who has consistently for the past eight grounds does the Attorney-General defend or ten years advocated a tax on land values withhis position to-day as an advocate of a out exemption, I should like to say what I think f the amendment proposed. That was an amendment to include an exemptionThis amendment reminds me of that cloud, no bigger than a man's hand that spread all over the political horizon. This amendment seems to me to contain something else than a mere attack on the principle of land-value taxation without exemptions, and seems uncommonly like an attack of a friend to upset the Government. It appears to me that this sudden conversionI can call it by no other name, and I am no neophyte in this matter-thi s sudden conversion of three earnest land-value taxers to this most incredible is not correct, as the honourable member and unheard-of theory of exemption, which is not an exemption at all, but a deduction, presages something extraordinary. Who could believe that these were the words of the present Attorney-General? The exemption then proposed was one of £500, arid the exemption now proposed is the much more drastic one of £5,000, ten times as much. Attorney-General did not approve of an exemption of even a penny, and he goes on lo give his reasonsI have never in my most insane and wild moments ever contemplated such ignominy as that; but I have given some attention to landvalue taxation for all that, although I have not inflicted on this long-suffering country anything of that description. I have attempted to read what those who know something more even than the honourable member for Hay have had to say on the matter. I remember the howl of indignation that awaited Henry George as he stepped off from Adelaide, when he told us how to impose a tax on unimproved land values to suit the Australian complexion. I was the bosom friend of a number of extremely infatuated single taxers at that time, and I remember what they called Henry George, and I read what they called him in America. The Attorney-General was unmeasured in his denunciation of the principle of exemption, and in characteristic fashion used all the terms of invective against those The present Attorney-General was who supported exemptions which parliamentary procedure would permit. He went on to sayAnd mark you, to allow a man to talk about justice because a man has purchased land at £ 1 an acre, and then say it is just to grant him immunity up to that amount of taxation, is to the last degree absurd, because some men bought land, sixty, eighty, and nearly a hundred years ago. Most men in this country who hold land to any extent bought it over twenty years ago. They have had the use of that land for twenty years without paying a fraction to the State. Are not the lands which it is proposed to exempt up to £5,000 not exactly in the same position? If it was not just to have an exemption of £ 1 then, on what £5,000 exemption. cocky ! Attorney-General may choose to treat this matter jocularly, but he was in a very different mood when bringing the Leader of the Opposition to book for his utterances on the same subject. and the honourable member is against it. well knows. This is an abortion of a land tax. is always against it. pose the Government's Bill because it is unjust-becaus e it is merely an expedient conceived in revenge. It is conceived in a At that time the desire to hit only those who cannot hit back-to hit the larger land-owners because they happen to be sonumerically small that they have no power to retaliate. That shows moral cowardice. But where in the proposals of the Government do we find the principle of land value taxation, coupled with the abolition of indirect taxes upon industry, taxes which fall heaviest upon our producing classes? That is the true principle of land value taxation, but I do not see it anywhere in this Bill. It does not appear because our honourable friends opposite have not the courage of their convictions.

Mi. W. ELLIOT JOHNSON -The honourable member is quite right; that is the single tax principle, and it was the original proposal of the Labour platform when the party was started as a party. It was the platform and the principle to which I subscribed, and it is the principle for which I still stand to-day. I am not, and never have been, in favour of super-imposing land value taxation with exemptions, and of a progressive character, upon existing taxation. I have always advocated the principle of land value taxation as a substituted tax, not as a means of bursting up this or that, but as a means of securing equal justice to all and providing revenue to carry on necessary governmental works and functions and the various ramifications of administration incidental to the conduct of the affairs of a civilized community. Those are the true principles upon which taxation should be based, but they are not recognised in this measure by the present occupants of the Treasury bench, or by the party behind them. something to which I have, I think correctly, applied the name of expediency. There was a time not so very far remote when it was the opinion of the Labour party that land taxation was a function which should be left entirely to the States. When Mr Watson was Leader of the Labour party he made this very plain in reply to a speech made, or a manifesto issued, by Mr Reid. Balmain Town Hall on 22nd November, 1906, only four short years ago, as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of the following day, he saidWhile Mr Reid was trying to frighten the farmers of Australia by the statement that the Labour party was endeavouring to bring about the nationalization of the land, he omitted to put the saving clause in, viz., that the question of land nationalization was one for the State Parliaments to deal with, and certainly was not to be attempted by the Federal Parliament. That was Mr Watson's utterance at election time as the mouth-piece of the Labour party in this Parliament. that not only was it a State matter, but that the party themselves had no thought of making it a Commonwealth matter. Brisbane Conference? mit that what he said at the Brisbane Conference was entirely different, but it was only another instance of the inconsistency and lack of principle characteristic of the Labour party nowadays. That which stands good to-day does not stand good to-morrow, and that which will stand good to-morrow will not be held good the day after. So we never know where the party are in regard to their proposals, simply because they have no principles. All their proposals are based merely on expediency, in order to catch in their sails whatever wind may be blowing from the popular quarter. A party who hope to legislate on these lines and to be regarded as reformers are doomed sooner or later to failure. A well-known man has said, "" You can fool some of the people all the time, and all the people some of the 'time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time."" 'So honourable members opposite will find later on. The shallowness of their measures and their total lack of principle will sooner or later be borne in upon the public mind, and one of these days the public will rise in their might and call the party to account because of the disastrous results which must necessarily follow legislation which What appears in this measure is fails to recognise the underlying principle of justice in its operations. member forgets that there was a great necessity for a political bribe at the last general election. so.

I therefore stand to-day as I stood in 1890, on the same platform, advocating the same principle, with the same ideals and the same belief in their ultimate triumph. General was not alone in his position at the time to which I have referred. He was supported by the present Leader of the New South Wales Labour party, Mr in the honourable member's contention.

I voted in favour of the £500, because, as far as I can see, it is reasonable. I believe that £1,000 would allow many large holders to escape. If this evil is existent-that men who hold land in larpe areas would cut it up to such an extent as to escape a good deal of taxation-if that exists in regard lo the £500, it is twice as great an evil in regard to the £ 1 . 0 0 0. I go further, and say that if it was a great evil under the £500 exemption it_ is ten times as great an evil under the £5,000 exemption. seems to forget, in making these quotations, that New South Wales, in 1895, was not the Commonwealth in 1910. a principle which was true in essence then must be equally true in essence now. The gentleman who is now Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, and a member of a Ministry proposing a £5,000 exemption, is identical with the gentleman who, in the New South Wales Parliament, described the theory of exemptions as being "" incredible and unheard of."" If the honourable member for Adelaide will take the trouble to read that speech through, he will see how soundly the Attorney-General rated all those who were going to vote for an exemption, for their desertion of a great principle. He said that exemptions could not be defended on any ground whatever. Yet now we have him proposing a £5,000 exemption. ber has not deserted the great flag, has he ? already made it plain that I still hold to my principles. ber, unfortunately, is in a party that will The Attorneynot propose them. mit that there is a certain amount of truth am not responsible for the opinions held by all the members sitting on this side. I can speak only for myself, but we on this side are in the happy position of not being bound by decisions in caucus. We are in no way trammelled, but have full liberty to express, and vote according to, our own convictions. Honourable members will find that out at a later stage of the debate, when I propose to move an amendment embodying the principle to which I am now giving utterance. Honourable members will then have an opportunity to show whether they wish to range themselves on the side the benefit of the whole community, or on that of expediency, injustice, and class legislation. We are troubled to know the real purpose of the Bill. During the recent electoral campaign it was claimed by every Labour candidate that if the party got into power a tax would be imposed to burst up big estates for the promotion of settlement. Now, without adequate explanation, the party has receded from that policy. The talk about bursting up large estates has practically ceased; even the Attorney-General has abandoned the position which he took up prior to the elections, though these changes are becoming so frequent that one follows them with difficulty. Why all this deception? Speaking at the Glebe Town Hall, Sydney, on the 15th February last, he was reported as followsThe chief plank of the Labour platform is to wipe out land monopoly by making it unprofitable to hold land out of use. The purpose was to burst up the big estates. . . That was the issue. That was what the election would turn on. On it depended the immigration policy and the defence policy of Australia. There was no question of raising revenue then. The object of the tax was the bursting up of large estates for the alleged promotion of agriculture and other rural settlement.

322,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"I adcannot have that effect. The electors were asked to vote for a land tax to increase settlement, and gave their mandate for such a tax. But having received an endorsement of their bursting up policy, Labour members now say, "" Our intention is, not to burst up big estates, but to obtain revenue."" Throughout the electoral campaign the string upon which Labour candidates played unceasingly was the bursting up of large estates. Perhaps it gave way at last under the strain. At any rate, they are now playing on another string. Three weeks before polling-day, in an article published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, headed, "" The case for Labour,"" the Attorney-General wrote of the land tax proposal of the Labour partyI t is to impose a graduated tax upon the unimproved value of land, exempting estates the unimproved value of which is £5,000 and under. There is no word about revenue being needed from this source for defence, the building of a Federal Capital, or any other purpose. The article is available to any honourable member who cares to refer to it in the Library. On Saturday last another declaration was made in an article in the same journal, but it is qualified by the developments which have occurred since the Labour party took office. The honourable member for Werriwa, on returning thanks for his election, is reported to have saidI f the Labour party came before the public in three years, and the big estates were not burst up, the people should consider them unworthy of their place. The honourable member said nothing about raising revenue for defence, or other Federal purposes, by means of a land tax. All that he and every member of the party was concerned with was the bursting up of big estates for the promotion of settlement. by taxing the land on which stands a bank, a shop, a factory, or a warehouse, however desirable such a tax may be from a revenue or economic stand-point. The bursting up of big estates for the encouragement of a vigorous immigration policy might be accomplished by taxing the pastoral lands of the country, but certainly could not be by the taxation of urban improved blocks of land of necessarily very small area. Mr Holman, M.L.A., the Deputy Leader of the New South Wales Labour party, speaking in support of the present member for Nepean, saidThe first principle of the Labour party was to put a graduated land tax on the great estates of Australia. Mr W. Elliot Johnson. The great estates of Australia are not those in the cities and towns, but the mammoth estates, covering thousands, and tens of thousands, of acres in the country. big estates in the city? are no ""great"" estates in the city, in the sense in which Mr Holman used the word. The site of a bank or a factory cannot be subdivided for the promotion of agriculture. There is much confusion of terms on the part of honourable members opposite. They do not seem to realize the real meaning or the proper application of the terms they employ. Mr Holman, when he spoke of ""great"" estates, obviously did not mean city estates. An estate may be valuable without being great. For the amount which would be charged for 2 feet of land in some parts of Collins-street, Melbourne, one could buy an area in the country greater ""than the whole of Melbourne and its suburbs. Mr Holman's subsequent remark bears out my contentionI f they could get rid of those 72S big holdersThe holders of big estates in the country; not of valuable city landI f they could get rid of those 728 big holders, they could divide the estates up into smaller ones, and so allow every inch of land to be cultivated. Mr Holman's idea was that the pastoral estates should be converted into agricultural areas, the holders being forced by taxation to subdivide. How could a city block already built upon be cut up into areas for cultivation ? On the face of it, such a proposition is absurd; and, consequently, honourable members who try to give to the word ""great,"" as used in that connection, the meaning ""valuable,"" will find the ground Settlement is not promoted cut from their feet by bhe later declaration of Mr Holman explanatory of his statement in regard to the subdivision of great estates. At the last general election, I was opposed by a reverend gentleman, who stood as a Lahour candidate, and who played this ""big-estates string"" on his fiddle until, I suppose, it was worn out like that on the fiddles played by other members of his party. Referring to the Federal land tax proposals embodied in the policy of the Labour party, he said that the chief object was "" to break up large estates and promote settlement."" Indeed, he went further, and said, "" It is a special tax for that purpose."" He did not say that it was a special tax to raise revenue to carry out Commonwealth works, to build",64,Closer Settlement

324,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"Ther erailways, to construct an Australian Navy, to set up the Federal Capital, to provide for the acquisition of the Northern Territory, or for any of those other great undertakings for which revenue will be required. It was a special tax, he said, to break up large estates and promote settlement. Mr J. C. Watson, the late leader of the Federal Labour party, after he had evidently abandoned the idea that land values taxation was a sphere of taxation belonging properly to the States alone, was careful to point out that the object of a tax of this kind was, not to produce revenue, but to burst up big estates. He went further, and declared that it would yield little or no revenue worth talking about. It was clear that he had no idea that a progressive land tax would be imposed upon urban properties. He never spoke of this as being in the slightest degree a taxation measure designed to raise revenue for Commonwealth purposes. Then we come to the manifesto of the Labour party, issued in connection with the last general election, and signed by the leaders of the movement. In that manifesto, we have the declaration that the Labour party's proposalis that a progressive land tax should be imposed we could do without taxation of any kind for the purpose of breaking up large estates. There was not a word in that manifesto as to the tax being imposed for revenue purposes. We have it, therefore, from the mouths of the Labour leaders, from prominent members of the Labour Government, as well as from Labour journals, and the Labour party's manifesto, that the object of this proposal, as embodied in the Labour platform, was to burst up big estates and settle people on the land. In view of the authorities I have quoted, there should be no doubt as to what was the original object of these proposals. Labour party receding from that position, and taking up what, in my opinion, is a proper stand. But it was not the stand upon which they based their appeal to the electors. And that is the essential point. Their former basis was wrong, and wholly indefensible on ethical or economic grounds. I pointed this out during my campaign, and predicted that it would be found to be unconstitutional. They have now backed down from the position because they find it is as I have said. A tax should not be imposed merely for the purpose of penalizing one set of land-owners to the advantage of another. Legislation can be passed not involving taxation to prevent the aggregation of large estates. It can be accomplished if it is thought necessary, by legislation prohibiting the holding of larger areas than may be considered requisite for the purpose of legitimate settlement. without the imposition of a tax. tax would not be necessary to bring it about. Ministers themselves hold the opinion that it is advisable to break up large estates for the purposes of closer settlement, and there is a more effective means of bringing that about than a cumbersome method of taxation which is unjust in its incidence, and unconstitutional in itself. So far as the present basis of taxation is concerned, I think that the purpose now declared, and not that originally stated, is the more correct one on which to base legislation involving taxation. If we are to have recourse to land value taxation to provide revenue, then we are on sound economic ground. It is the one legitimate source of revenue standing out above every other to meet the legitimate expenses of Government. I do not believe in imposing taxation for the mere sake of taxation. If I should be better pleased. The less taxation we have to pay the better, and the nearest approach to that condition of things' is to be obtained by the abolition of indirect taxation -the abolition of those taxes which press upon industry, and fall upon labour, and which the poorest section of the community have most largely to pay. I should abolish all those if we could do so. But since we must have revenue, then I say that the lands of the community which belong naturally to the community as a whole We now find the -in which, being land animals, the people have a vital personal interest-constitut e a legitimate source of taxation to provide revenue for the government of the country. But there is a right and a wrong method of procedure, and that adopted by the present Government is fundamentally wrong, because it is not founded upon the recognition of the equal rights of every individual member of the community to share in values which are purely community created. On what ground can any exemption be defended? Why is it wrong for any one to hold over £5,000 worth of land without taxation, and right for others to hold £5,000 worth, without taxation? If the community has a right to take in",65,Closer Settlement

326,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"Yes; a2340 taxation any of the value above £5,000, they have just the same right to take portion of the value up to £5,000. If we could get rid of every tax that now presses heavily upon industry, and upon those engaged in rural pursuits, there would be no shadow of even a pretence of excuse for any exemption, and we should have none of that trouble arising from exemptions which is bound to occur by reason of collusion, favouritism, evasion, ancl the various as "" sheep among the wolves."" Who are known methods of escaping payment of one's just obligation to the Treasury in reAre politicians the poor innocent lambs? turn for the Governmental advantages which the people enjoy. It has not been explained why it is reasonable and proper to levy taxation upon £5,001 worth of unimproved land values, and to exempt from taxation ,£5,000 worth. The whole proposition is absurd. On what ground of justice can such a principle be defended ? I have ransacked my brains, as well as the standard economic authorities, and can find none. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m. we adjourned, I was pointing out that the proposal to tax £5,001 worth of land, and to exempt £5,000 worth, is absolutely indefensible on any ground of justice or logic, and that I have been unable to.find a reason for such a proposal, other than that form of political cowardice, which sacrifices principles rather than risk the sacrifice of votes. explanation that occurs to the honourable member! be very glad to hear the honourable member tell us member will not have a chance ! thought as much. should not have an opportunity of hearing either the honourable member himself, or any other honourable member on that side, in defence of this proposal, on the ground of justice, though, no doubt, it may be defended on the ground of expediency, like every other unsound proposal. In this case, "" expediency "" is only another name for "" political cowardice."" Honourable members opposite seize hold of a principle and apply it in a wrong way and up to a certain point, selecting for its operation that class of electors who are not numerically strong enough to offer effective resistance, and excluding large Land Tax [REPRESENTATIVES.] Assessment Bill. numbers of people, who, by reason of their numerical strength, are able to retaliate at election times. If honourable members opposite will only be reasonably honest they must admit that such is the case. I have already quoted from speeches made at the Labour Conference, to show that this idea lay behind the proposal. This was shown when Mr Holman declared that it would not do for the members of the party to go the "" sheep,"" and who are the ""wolves ""? Fancy them going amongst the general public, whom they describe as wolves, and being swallowed for advocating a principle which can be defended on every ground; and which I am prepared to defend, and have defended, in the heart of farming communities! I have shown farmers in their own centres by demonstration on the blackboard that it is to their interest to adopt the principle of sound land values taxation without exemptions and thus get rid of other taxation which presses unduly on them, and obtain a relief that the Labour party now, or at any future time, is not likely to offer them. In practice, what will this taxation lead to? Unquestionably it will lead to evasion, and open the door to dishonest practices. An estate ot ,£20,000 will be exempt to the extent of £[5,000, leaving £15,000 taxable, on the graduated scale, at i j d . in the £ 1 , yielding £ 9 3 15s. But what will be more simple than for the owner of the estate to divide it amongst his three sons, or other members of his family and himself. £5,000 worth to each, each ""dummy"" division thus escaping taxation by coming within the exemption? Mr W. H . IRVINE I do not think so. been found so in New Zealand. Further, I thought we the imposition of a progressive tax has not stopped the aggregation of large estates m the Dominion; and I may be pardoned for quoting the following from the New Zealand Budget Statement of 1909, page 20, under the heading "" Limitation ot area.""The evil of aggregation still prevails, and drastic measures must be employed to check it. Moreover, the law still allows too large an area of Crown land to be taken up by one person, and the proposed legislation will therefore provide a limit of 400 acres in respect of first-class land, and a correspondingly reduced area in respect of second and third-class land. An effective provision will also be made against evasion by providing that these limitations shall apply to the area to be occupied and not merely to the area owned.",66,Closer Settlement

332,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"It hasIt will be seen that a progressive tax has led to evasion, and has not prevented the aggregation of large estates, and that now the Government are driven to legislative proposals, not involving a tax, but of a different character, for the purpose of meeting the evil. Like causes produce like effects; and the causes that lead to evasion and aggregation in New Zealand will similarly operate in the Commonwealth. If the real purpose of the party is to break up large estates, it can be achieved much more effectively by other means. Taxation can only be justified generally by the needs of public revenue; though, perhaps, in some special cases it may be imposed on other grounds, but certainly not on the grounds which, though not stated in the Bill, were urged by the Labour party during the election campaign. I should like to quote another extract from the same New Zealand Budget as follows :Every man who now owns a freehold is entitled to it, and under no conditions would the State be justified in taking any step to weaken his freehold tenure. In dealing with the disposal of its lands the State should observe two great principles-first , suitably close settlement must be promoted and encouraged by every reasonable means; second, the State must, in justice to its present and future people as a whole, reserve to ihem some part of that value which public expenditure will create, in the lands it is now parting with lo private hands. The Budget proceedsThere is room for wide difference of opinion ns lo the extent to which State operations and private effort respectively create values in land, but while there may be this difference as to the degree there surely can be no such difference as to the fact that in a young ancl sparsely-populated coun£161,324,000. Those figures clearly prove try like this, where such enormous natural developmental work is being done mainly at the expense of the people as a whole, some increased value will be steadily added by State operations to the lands it is parting with, ancl of that inireased value the people are entitled to nt least a share. I can support those views as being on sound lines of policy. I take no exception to the recognition of the public ownership in land values which are created by the activities and expenditure in connection with the growth of population. On the contrary justice and equity alike demand that recognition. created by the community as a whole are a proper and legitimate source to be levied on for the purpose of carrying on the government of the community. Those values belong to the community, and the use of them for the benefit of the community is only the recognition of the right of the community to participate in what the community has created. But, similarly, [85] the value which attaches to productions the result of individual effort and activity belong naturally and by right to the people who create that value. That constitutes the natural reward of labour and capital. Of course, nobody really creates anything, not even the tiniest mote that floats in the sunshine; but using the word ""create"" in the sense of manufacturing or acquiring wealth by labour, such wealth or value belongs by right to the individual, and should be sacred as the property of the individual, and not made the subject of taxation for community needs, except when other sources, such as I have indicated, have failed to give the necessary revenue. I was saying that a similar policy of progressive land taxation in New Zealand had not enabled people to obtain cheap land. One of the reasons urged for this taxation is that it will enable people to obtain lancl cheaper than they do now. Experience once more is against that dteory, for in New Zealand it has not had that result. I have before me a table taken from the official Year-Book of New Zealand, which shows that, although the increase of population in a certain period was only 25 per cent., the increase of unimproved land values was nearly 100 per cent, in the same period. In the year 1897 the population of New Zealand was, in round numbers, 729,000. and the unimproved land value was £84,401,000. By the year 1908 the population had increased to 960,000, and the unimproved land value to that this system of taxation has not resulted in the cheapening of land to those who want to use it. The progressive land f ax in that country has not cheapened land for land users, or stopped the aggregation of estates, but has, on the other hand, led to evasions of taxation. In order to correct the evils that still continue to exist under that system, and to prevent the aggregation of large estates ancl the evasion of the tax, resort has now to be had to other legislative methods. With regard to The values which are the question of differentiating between one class of land-owner ancl another, whilst I am not a lawyer, and cannot claim to be a constitutional authority, there is one aspect of the constitutional question to which I desire briefly to refer. I allude to the question of discrimination and preference. In this case there is a differentiation in taxation, not between different States, but between different persons and different classes of persons in the same State. It is a question worthy of the serious consideration of the legal members of the House whether the Government's taxation proposals, with their £5,000 exemption and -their graduated increases according to various amounts above £5,000, do not come within the meaning of "" preference and -discrimination,"" and whether they do not -constitute a breach of the Constitution. According to Quick and Garran. page 912Guided by the English and American authoriwhich I have enumerated? Might it not ties, we may now proceed to discuss the meaning apply to taxes as well as railway tariffs? of the words ""preference"" and "" discrimination "" in this Constitution. Before any clear idea can be formed of what constitutes a preference or discrimination which is undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State, it is necessary to obtain some definition of the words "" preference"" and "" discrimination "" themselves. A preference is -a setting of one person or thing before another; here it means a dissimilarity of treatment, involving advantage to one person, locality, or class of goods, or prejudice to another. Dis-crimination is a difference of treatment; as applied to railways it is defined by Webster's International Dictionary as "" the arbitrary imposition of unequal tariffs for substantially the same service."" If , in discussing this question, we substitute ""unequal taxes"" for ""unequal tariffs,"" I think, as a layman, that that quotation will apply, because there is a discrimination between different persons and classes in exactly the same way. In -the same paragraph it is stated""Discrimination"" in the Inter-State Commerce Act, section 4, is applied to persons only, and means a departure from equal treatment of persons in respect of substantially the same service. individuals to the exclusion of the rest.. Is not this Bill a departure from the equal -treatment of persons in respect of substantially the same services? Do not all people -get substantially the same services as the result of government? In that connection, I refer to means of transport and conveyance, police protection, defence, and all fthose other services which are meted out ;in substantially the same measure to every individual in the community. Again, the ^authors stateAt least it is clear that the words "" prefer-ence "" and ""discrimination"" together cover differences of treatment (1) as between different persons; (2) as between different descriptions of traffic; and (3) as between different localities. That is to say, the words include the unequal treatment of persons, &c."" I do not think it can be denied that there ^ in this Bill unequal treatment of persons in the proposals for exemption, and for making some persons pay a higher measure of taxation than others in proportion to the value of their land. Mr W. Elliot Johnson. Mr W. H . IRVINE -To what sectioa are the writers referring? 102 of the Constitution. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That section refers only to railways. of course, to the honourable member's opinion, but might it not apply not only to railways and the services rendered by them, but also to the other governmental services membei say this is a discriminating tax? There is discrimination all the time from t r i e £5>°oi point upwards, and also by the exemption itself. I shall be glad if the honourable member, as a lawyer, will look closely into that matter. My own view is that the guiding principle of Democracy should be, and at one time was, in New South Wales, at any rate, freedom to produce for everybody, and freedom to exchange. .Freedom to produce necessarily involves freedom of access to Nature's storehouse, to natural opportunity, to the land from which we all come, from which we all have to draw our subsistence, and to which we must all ultimately return. I am, therefore, at' one with the Labour party in their contention that land is a proper subject for taxation, ancl that we cannot have freedom to produce while land is monopolized by a few There can be no freedom to produce while natural opportunities are locked up from human labour, and human production cannot go on unrestrained, unchecked, and untrammelled while the right of a few people to own the earth's surface is recognised to the exclusion of the remainder. The principle of recognising public ownership in land values is, therefore, right. But their Land Taxation Bill does not rest upon a just basis. It is not to the principle that I object, but to the discriminating, wrong, and unjust method of applying-it. Whilst recognising the right, we must do justice to all in applying the principle. Having conceded so much, we are met with the next proposition. Freedom of production is useless without freedom of exchange-that is, freedom to exchange the products of our labour and capital for those of the labour and capital of those in other parts of the world.

There is no escape from the logic of that position. It is here that I am opposed to the Labour party, because they now deny that principle. The first members of that partyrecognised these fundamental and basic truths, which are eternal; but the present members choose to ignore them. members of the party during the last Parliament were responsible for imposing the heaviest restrictions on freedom of exchange ever legalized in any country. They were responsible for taxing with crushing severity the food, clothing, and household requisites of the poorest in the community. They taxed, too, similarly, the requirements of the farmers and producers. manufactures in a manner which has seriously handicapped the farmers, whom 'they taxed to keep boys and girls employed in the city factories, to crowd the city slums, and deplete the population of the rural districts, and to intensify the social evils which we all deplore. member's leader? of those on this side are not entirely blameat present do not see eye to eye with me less. What was done could not have been done, had it not been for the Labour party. The.duties to which I refer could not have been passed had it not been for the votes of the Labour Party, many of whom were professed Free Traders, and yet voted to place the heaviest imposts on the backs of the workers, who find that, owing to the Tariff, the value of £ 1 has been reduced to about :13s. 6d -that is, that £ 1 now will purchase only as much as they could have bought for 13s. 6d. in New South .Wales prior to Federation. ber must not pursue that line of argument. sire is to point out that what we should do is not to add taxation to that already in existence, but to substitute a land-values tax for taxes on labour products, and thus relieve the poor of burdens which they should not have to bear, and place those burdens on the shoulders of those who should properly carry them.

Unfortunately, two or three of the members on this side of the Chamber are nearly as Conservative as the Ministerialists, though, as the result of their association with the Liberals of New South They piled up taxation on Wales, they are losing much of their veneer of Conservatism, and will, sooner or later, fall into the democratic line and recognise that we must have a progressive policy which will acknowledge the right of the people to enjoy to the full their natural opportunities, and to be free of taxation 011 articles of human production. This principle has always been associated with Liberalism in the Old Country, and I hope that some of the members on this side who on this matter will, as the result of this debate, come round to my views, and that some of those opposite, who, no doubt, desire to do their best for the workers, though their methods will have the opposite effect, will ultimately see the error of their, ways, and return to the fold of freedom, acknowledging that the true salvation of Labour lies in the recognition of the right of the workers to be free. I will move the amendment as circulated at a later stage of the debate. -It is with pleasure that I congratulate the Government 011 having brought forward this measure so early in the session.

I recognised both those purposes when addressing the electors j but I also stated that there was something deeper and greater in the proposal, and that I favoured the imposition of a land tax because such a tax is the only one that is just and fair, and it could not be shifted on to other people's shoulders. possesses no land. member will have an opportunity to look after his big estates later; and I shall be glad, therefore, if he will keep quiet while I am addressing the House. I understand that he has no knowledge of mercantile economy, so that what I am about to say may enlighten him. Those who have studied mercantile economy, know that a tax on products coming into the country, for whatever purpose imposed, often enables the sellers of goods to greatly increase their profits. If a merchant is running his business successfully, he is able, not only to pass on to those to whom he sells the Customs duties levied on his goods, but also to make them pay interest on the money which he spends in meeting Customs charges. An unimproved land value tax, however, cannot be passed on, because the landlord always gets as much rent as he can from the tenant. are not like the honourable member. I am sorry that he is accumulating so much wealth, because it may blight his intellect. If that happens, he will eventually adopt the measures now taken by most landlords, and, instead of treating his tenants in the philanthropic way in which, I understand, they are now treated, will rent his houses to the highest bidders. Landlords get as much as they can from their unfortunate tenants at present; and, therefore, cannot pass on any taxation which we may impose on their properties. That is why there is so much opposition to this proposal on the part of honourable members seated on the other side of the Chamber. now have to pay their just and fair share of taxation. I feel sure that the honourable member for Parramatta will bear out what I have said. I do not know his present views on land taxation; but, in the past, no one was better informed on the land question than he, and for years, when he held a high and honourable position in the Legislative Assembly of New South-Wales, I was a student of his speeches. Another matter to which I wish to refer is this: It is rent, not supply and demand, that regulates wages. How can a business man or a farmer who has to pay high rents afford to give good wages to employee's? Landlords take such a huge share of the amount of wealth produced every year, that their tenants cannot earn a fair interest on their outlay. I polled heavily in my constituency, because I said that I did not look upon the contractor employing fifty or one hundred men as a capitalist, as he might be paying rent, andhave an overdraft at the bank. How could such a man be a capitalist? One of the keenest and brighest intellects in Australia, a man who is not appreciated here as he should be, although he is appreciated in Germany and Switzerland, where his books on the land question and on evolution are being printed to be distributed in the schoolsI refer to Mr A. J. Ogil/y-says Let the workers realize . . . . (1) That all ground Rent,-amounting to millions in the Australian Colonies alone, is so much pure tribute which they have to find for the enrichment of a privileged class which does nothing for it, and that it all comes out of the earnings of work; for the annual output being what it is, the more of it that goes to the do-nothings the less there remains for the do-alls. (2) That all that part of this enormous tribute that represents Monopoly Rent, as distinguished from Differential Rent, springs from the power of the land-owners to withhold natural opportunities, checking production and causing that cut-throat competition for employment that keeps down labourers' wages, tradesmen's profits, professional men's incomes, and earnings of work of all kinds. That is the statement of a farmer of some repute in Tasmania who is certainly one of the keenest intellects in the Commonwealth. I have attended numerous lectures given by him, and am glad of this opportunity to pay him a tribute for what he has done in educating the youth of our State. We have a similar statement from John Stuart Mill. Speaking from memory, They will I think that it was in .1856, that in referring to the Irish land tenantry, he said that every seven years tenders are called for leasing the lands, and that if a bad season is experienced the unfortunate tenant has the burden placed upon his back, like the old man of the sea, and goes on bearing the capitalist all along the line. The result of this policy is illustrated by the fact that in 1800-1 Ireland had a population of 8,000,000, whereas at the present",70,Closer Settlement

347,Mr Laird Smith,"Al l landlordstime it has a population of only a little over 4,000,000. That is the position of Ireland to-day, notwithstanding that quite recently the British Government have expended a large sum in acquiring estates there. Unfortunately, the railways of Ireland, unlike those of Australia, are not owned by the State, and immediately a farmer is able to get improved returns from his land railway freights are increased 25 per cent., and in that way his money is taken from him. I refer to these facts as showing the important part that land plays in the whole economic question. It is the source of all wealth, it is the fulcrum upon which the monopolist rests his lever in pushing the wage slave into his present position. How many men would be working for others if they could become their own masters by obtaining land for themselves on easy terms? With all due deference to the Opposition, I deny that land can be obtained in Australia as easily as they would have us believe. All land easy of access is one huge monopoly. In speaking in this way, I wish the House to understand that I am attacking, not individuals, but the system itself. While the electors allow the system to exist they alone are responsible, and not those who monopolize the land. But on the 13th April last the people sent us here to break down land monopoly, and we are going to do so. If we do not, then upon us, and not upon the big land-owners of the present day, must rest the responsibility. It is for this reason that I am disposed to speak generously of the squatters, but in view of what we have heard from the other side, I am impelled to quote facts as to the actual position. The honourable member for Wakefield said ihat the squatters had done much to develop the country. I turn to Mr B. R. Wise's excellent work, The Commonwealth o j Australia, which is now being read and quoted all over the world. The right honourable member for Swan seems to be amused at that statement, but I assure him that my attention was first directed to this work by a quotation from it which I saw in a leading London review. Mr Wise points out that in New South Wales there was a legal tender currency, not of gold or silver, but of rum, and that large areas of land were acquired in exchange for that commodity. At page 97 of his book we have the statementRum for the time supplied a real commercial want, and only the officers could fill it. Those were the military officersThey used their position as masters of the labour market without scruple to develop their own grants and to acquire othersThe reference is to grants of land by purchaseThe foundation of many large fortunes was laid by this monopoly of what are now suburban lands. That was how the suburban lands of Sydney were acquired. If my memory serve me well it was in 1788 that the British Government sent out Governor Phillip, who in that year decreed that not one foot of land in this great continent should be sold. He said that the people should be settled 011 the land, but that they must be settled on residential leases. I join with Mr Wise in regretting that he did not remain in Australia long enough to conduct the land policy as it should have been carried out. Unfortunately for Australia, he was recalled, and Major Grose,' who was put in command, ancl administered the land laws, parcelled out lands throughout New South Wales in free gift to his officers and his friends. Governor Macquarie continued on the same lines, and Mr Wise saysWhereas the whole of the grants by his predecessors only totalled 177,500 acres, he granted 400,000 acres. Then we find that the A. and A. Co. and the Van Diemen's Land Company were formed under private Acts of Parliament to acquire* the one. 1,000,000 acres of land around Newcastle ancl on the Liverpool Plains, and the other, 500,000 acres in the north-west corner of Tasmania. A return obtained by Gipps in 1845 showed that four squatters in New South Wales then held an area of 7,750,460 acres, and that the fifty-six largest holders occupied no less than«i2,ito square miles, as against 677 square miles occupied by the fifty-six smallest holders. 1 was much amused this afternoon by the statement of the honourable member for Perth that there was no land monopoly in Western Australia. The honourable member said that there had never been a land monopoly there; that people could get lancl for the asking in that State, and that there was plenty of lancl waiting for intending settlers. 'What does Mr Wise say?Free grants of immense areas were given to the founders on the understanding that they would introduce immigrants at their own expense. Captain Stirling, the first administrator, was given 100,000 acres, and Mr Peel, the leading spirit in the enterprise, 250,000 acres, in return for which he undertook to bring out 400 settlers. Mr Wise does not say whether this gentleman brought them out. Other immigrants followed, and their women had to fish off 'the beach, like the coloured people, because they could not obtain foodstuffs. Mr Wise also tells us that settlers were so far apart that they often lost each other. And this in a country in which, according to the honourable member for Perth, there has been no land monopoly. I should like to know whether the Government of Western 'Australia, in acquiring land, have followed a practice that has been adopted in Victoria where rich land originally taken up at from 9s. to £,\ per acre has recently been acquired by the Government at prices ranging from JQQ to £12 per acre. I spend my week-ends in visiting various parts of Victoria, with the object of obtaining a knowledge of the land question in this State. Only the other day I visited Geelong, and was shown a large area of beautiful land which, until recently, was in the hands of one man. Some of that -land for farming and orchard purposes has brought from £40 to £130 per acre. That was the information given to me, and I was also told that the Government had paid a huge sum to acquire certain land for closer settlement. The Government scheme was to settle people on areas of 8 acres each. I have been unable to ascertain the price paid for this land, but I do know that the State placed settlers on land at the summit of the driest hill in the district. there a gale strong enough almost to take off one's head. make a living there, although on the alluvial flats below there is excellent land with an axe had hardly been put, except in splita river frontage and in every way suited for closer settlement. Is that the policy that should be pursued in order to make our country productive? I think not. I also had given to me a description of a dairy as run by the Government, and was astounded to learn the results of closer settlement. From the hill to which I have just referred I obtained a fine view of country extending for a distance of many miles, and my guide informed me that thousands of acres there were owned by one or two individuals. Do we wish that state of affairs to continue? If we do, then we had better simply adhere to the old policy. -I come now to the position of my own State, and I regret very much that the honourable member for Franklin is not present. The honourable member has declared that I know little of the land of Tasmania outside of Hobart. Let me say that I know Mr Laird Smith. Tasmania as well as does any man in this House. I have had to battle right along the north-west and the west coasts. I surveyed the route of the first telephone line to Montague, and erected a telephone line there about twenty-two years ago. A stranger visiting the town of Burnie is at once struck by its resemblance to a crosscut saw. One sees a beautiful house and a vacant patch succeeded by another beautiful house and yet another vacant piece of land. The existence of these vacant plots is due to the fact that the whole of the land in the vicinity of Burnie has been monopolized for some time by the Van Diemen's Land Company. Consequently, that flourishing town with an enormous area of good back country has not made the headway that it should have done. It has, certainly, developed considerably since the honourable member for Darwin was returned as its representative, and evidently the owners of large areas in that part of Tasmania are taking friffht. I have heard it said in the House that they are about to amalgamate with other companies, and to cut up their lands for closer settlement. I feel confident that this is so, because I understand that the Minister of Home Affairs was recently negotiating for some land in the vicinity, and when he negotiates for the purchase of land we may be sure that there is something coming out of it later on. He Last Sunday there was blowing must have "" got into the know "" very early. There can be no doubt that that land is People are expected to well suited for settlement. A few months ago 1 was shown a bush block upon which ting timber, and which in the open market, under the hammer, brought £ 1 8 an acre. The owner has to scrub it at a cost of ios. an acre, and wait for about eight months before it can be burnt off. If he gets a good burn-off, there is not much picking up to do; but, otherwise, he has to spend money and time in picking up the small timber and laying down grass. In fact, twelve months is gone before there is any return from fattening cattle. the place of Mr Robert Laird, about 3 miles from Burniej and it was there that I was for two years learning farming. Quoting from memory, from the Daily Post, of Hobart, I can say that a Mr Carroll went on to the Company's land many years ago, and for 100 acres of land he paid over £6,000 in rent; yet to-day he does not",71,Closer Settlement

His rent has been raised, and the Company wished him to dig a well at his own expense. Further up, at White Hills, in the district of the honourable member for Wilmot-wher e that gentleman told the settlers what he was going to do tor them in the Federal Parliament-som e of the farmers have been on the estate for about forty years as tenants; and the other day they got notice to quit. They have made the farms what they are to-day, and have become attached to their homes; but they are now placed in the same position as tenants in Ireland, or in Scotland, under the Duke of Sutherland, liable to eviction. Indeed, they were to be evicted, but the Labour newspaper, the Daily Post, took up the case, with the result that some of the tenants have been told that they may remain for the term of their natural lives. From what I have been told, I understand that the landlords gave the land for the railway to pass over, with the result that the rents were raised 2s. and 3s., showing that it is the owner that scores every time from the unearned increment. member not know that that part of the country is very closely settled? I do; and I am glad the honourable member reminds me of the fact., There is a system of taxation in Tasmania under which, immediately land becomes closely settled, and improvements are made, the .farmers are taxed for their energy.' If a farmer puts up a fence, or erects a better -house to live in, the improvements are taxed. Although a man may have paid £ 1 an acre for land, and cleared it at a cost of £ 8 an acre, immediately he plants an orchard, and before the trees can bear, he is taxed on an assessment of, perhaps, £100 an acre. ment that does that? Government in Tasmania that does it. ment imposed that tax? It has been the system for years. posed by the Government of the party that has been in power all these years. Many years ago there came from England a ship-load of farmers, who went on to land owned by Mr John Williams; and that gentleman simply sat back and collected, increasing the rents to their highest economic value. The tenants made the farms valuable, and remained on them until Mr Williams died. Then it was found that, according to his will, the lands were to be sold; and I have yet to learn that one of the original tenants was able to buy a farm. In the districts of Norfolk Creek and in another district, we find an absentee landlord who sent along his steward to raise the rent when he thought fit, with ,the result that the tenants there live in verypoor dwellings, and make few or no improvements, for the simple reason that to do so only means an increase of their indebtedness to the landlord. This is in Tasmania, where I have had to slave as hard as any man, because of high rents and landlordism. It is a mistake for any country to raise the value of land above the true economic value, because, rest assured, a crisis must come sooner or later. If we can bring the land down to the true economic value, and make it possible for farmers' sons to secure farms easily, we are doing something to justify our being sent here at the last election. A few Sundays ago, I visited Seymour, in Victoria, honourable and there met the sturdy son of a farmer who was not a bit afraid of the Labour party, although he was one of the "" pigeons"" whom the honourable member for Ballarat says we are going to "" pluck."" In my opinion, the "" pigeon"" has been ""plucked "" long enough, and we are going to stop the "" plucking."" He has very little feathers now; but -we are going to leave him the few he has; and, in my opinion, the quotation of the honourable member was not at all apt. This gentleman pointed out to me a place where a family had lived on a small farm for some considerable time. There was the farmer and his seven sons all around him; but, when the lease expired, tenders were called, and the farmer, not being the higher tenderer, was obliged to leave the district with his family; and they are now apart, scattered over Australia. Is that sort of thing good for Victoria, or any other country ? The occupation of land by the squatter does not give the greatest value to a country. That country is the wealthiest that has the greatest number of happy and healthy individuals in it. would have done the same as was done at Seymour.

I am told that that municipality owns land which yields a rental of about £5,000 a year, or 3d. in the pound for every elector in the municipality. I was shown a splendid hotel, for which a rental of £ 8 a week is paid, and a.whole row of shops occupied by tenants of the municipality, who are not rack-rented, and none of whom have given up their tenancies for a number of years. Is it to the advantage of the Government to send people out of the country? VVe are spending large sums in immigration; and, in return, we see great headings in the newspapers : ' Immigra1 tion to Australia,"" over articles which announce that fourteen people have arrived in Victoria by one ship ! Under the system favoured by the Labour party, we shall have immigrants teeming in by thousands. We are going to get control of the land and of the money volume; and when immigrants arrive, they will be placed on the land and given advances at 4 per cent., in order able member must confine himself to the question. to diverge, but the subjects are very closely connected. I realize that if, by some terrible means, we could to-night demolish every building in this beautiful city, we could, if labour were procurable, in two years have a city even more beautiful; whereas, if all the farms and the people on them were wiped out, the grass would grow in Bourke-street in six months. All the wealth comes from the land; and if the people cannot get on the land, they canknow of nothing more depressing than to not produce wealth. I am glad that there are farmers in the galleries to-night, to see children to seek work elsewhere; and I how the benches opposite are crowded by the Opposition, who, we are told "" keep a House."" a friend to hear the debate on this Bill, and to show him how we are misrepresented in the newspapers. On that occasion, although the Attorney-General was speaking, there was one member on the Opposition benches, and, as the speech went on, others came gently in until there were four or five. That is the Opposition which, we are told, has to "" keep a House."" ber must confine himself to the question before the Chair. there is a quorum to-morrow ! ance to-day; there was not a Minister in the chamber at one time this afternoon. was. that this country should be populated, not only to produce wealth, but for the purposes of defence, because we cannot hold Australia unless we defend it. What was the excuse for taking the lands from the unfortunate natives, whom God had placed here, and deporting them to Flinders Island, where, according to Fenton, the historian of the island State, they used to sit and look longingly towards their native land ? The excuse was simply that they were not making the best use of the land; and, on the same principle, if we do not make the best use of it, we have no right to hold it. For those reasons I am anxious to see the lands made available within easy distance of railways, so that farmers' sons may marry and populate the country, and become wealth producers. Only recently a young man in Tasmania took the risk of getting married; and what was said by his thrifty wife-that "" thrifty wife "" of whom we hear so much from the honourable member for Parkes. She said, "" You take 3 trip to Melbourne, John, to celebrate your honeymoon, and I will stay at home, so that we may be able to pay the rent."" We do not want young married people to have to do that sort of thing. We want to make it possible for young men to settle on their, own lands in their own little homes. I see a man having to leave his wife and have seen many of those cases. Men have to do that because the land is locked up The other day I invited all round them. The other day, I had the painful experience, when on a visit to Bendigo, of seeing strong men by the dozen applying, in answer to an advertisement, for leave to toil. Somebody has saidSee yonder toor, alaboured wight, so abject, mean and vile, Who begs a brother of this earth to give him leave to toil.

That is sound, economic advice. much to-day about the money-lenders; but what is the gocd of the money it you cannot got the men to use it, or if the men have not the land to put the money into in order to produce wealth? When Robinson Crusoe landed on his island, he did not take Spanish dollars ashore, but took wheat so that he could produce wealth. That is what we want to do in Australia. We want to make the lands available so that our young men may be settled on them, and be a valuable asset to the country. Where we put one man on the land, there will be two or three more in the town serving him. I wish to reply to fhe remarks which were made by the honourable member for Lang when he twitted us by introducing the question of Free Trade and Protection. I admit that it has nothing to do with this question; but the farmer is not served by getting his implements free. I remember, many years ago in Victoria, when the farmers combined with the Free Traders, and binders were put on the free list. rannot reply to the honourable member for Lang on that point. I feel sure that I would have done so effectively. I have been twitted with being a single-taxer; but I am not one, and I will tell the House why. -free, and is not interest part of the rent that he would confiscate? No person is right in advocating the single tax; and that is what has put so many countries back. I should tax the land with a graduated tax, so that it would be impossible for any man to hold estates of a value of, say, £100,000. That is what I meant this afternoon when I said 1 would put a tax of 8d. in the £ 1 on men with ,£100,000 estates and over, because an unimproved value of £100,000 is too much for any man to hold. I would tax an estate of that size so heavily that the owner would have to cut it up and make the best use of it. Those who have listened to the honourable member for Denison must express the hope that the millennium which he thinks is coming to this country, when there shall be all wealth and no poverty, and every man shall live peaceably with his neighbour, will .speedily arrive. Any one who thought that this was a land tax Bill must have ing about the Legislative Council. The wondered when listening to the honourable member's speech, because it was a land policy speech throughout, and diWe have heard rected altogether to improving the means of settling and occupying the lands of Australia. Under the Constitution to which we owe our existence as a Parliament, and which was given to us by the States of their own free will, and without duress, land control is not one of the powers handed over to us. It belonged to the States, and when they gave us our Constitution, they retained all their powers in this regard. I , therefore, take it that all the desires of the honourable member, and many others, with regard to the best way to control and administer the lands of the Commonwealth are not within our scope. The honourable member, with his enthusiasm on this question, should have endeavoured to enter the Tasmanian Parliament, where he would have had full power in regard to those matters which he, apparently, has so much at heart, and would have had no restriction placed upon him, not only in advocating, but in doing his best, to carry out the views that he appears to hold. The one conclusion, at which those who have listened to this debate must have arrived, is that those who have spoken in that way think that this Parliament is much wiser and fat better able to subdivide, and generally settle, the lands, than are the members of the State Parliaments. I cannot see why we should arrogate to ourselves superior A single-taxer would let interest go knowledge or ability in regard to a matter of which we have only a very scant knowledge, and of which the people of the States, through their representatives in the local Parliaments, have full knowledge. full knowledge; but they do not want to act. should they be coerced by the honourable member?

Perhaps they had very good reason for their action; but I do not propose to discuss that matter or to be drawn into the local politics of any State. I am dealing with this question on its merits as a public question; and not with the question of the franchise for the Legislative Council in the State of Victoria. My point is that we are arrogating to ourselves superior wisdom in regard to the management and control of land. Eveni f we had the power, we do not possess the knowledge and experience requisite to deal with this question to the extent to which they are possessed by those who are locally returned for a distinct part of the continent, and who are acquainted with it to a far greater degree than honourable members here are acquainted with the affairs of the whole continent. opinion. orable member mean to say that he has as much knowledge of the circumstances of, say, Western Australia as have the members of the local Parliament in that State? The honourable member really knows nothing about it, having visited it for perhaps only a day or two in his life. We certainly have not in this House equal knowledge of any State with the representatives of that State in the local Parliament. The electors who sent those' persons to the local Legislative Assembly also sent us to this House; and the State members have far greater knowledge and have all the power in regard to land settlement and land control. In fact, they have all the powers with regard to the subdivision, settlement, and control of land, while we have none whatever. One of the objections that I have to thisBill, and my great objection to speeches such as we have had to listen to to-night, is that there is a total absence of any recognition of the powers of the States, and a desire to make us believe that this Parliament, under the Federal Constitution, has powers which it does not possess. One of the faults which I have to find with honourable members opposite and their platform and policy is that ever since they have been in the Federal Parliament they have desired, in every way, to invade the legislative arena reserved under the Constitution to the States. That has been a great drawback, and has done an immense injury to Australia. This dissatisfaction with the powers given to us by the States, and the desire to take more powers, is exemplified by the speeches we have heard to-day, and yesterday also, and by the proposals that have been made by members of the same party throughout Australia. The attempt to usurp a power which has never been given to us by the States, is most unfair to the people, and unconstitutional into the bargain. We have been told recently that the primary object of the Bill is to obtain revenue. Those in charge of the measure have become afraid that by harping upon the bursting up of large estates they may get into trouble. They dare not say in the Bill itself that its object is to bring about the subdivision of the lands of Australia. The Labour party told the country-and it has been said in this Chamber-that a measure would be introduced to bring about land subdivision; but we were told last is a matter of night by the Attorney-General that what is said about the Bill does not count, that it the intentions which prompted its introduction are not stated in it, they cannot be read into it. I do not know that I have any right to speak about closer settlement, because the Constitution does not empower us to pass land legislation; but as you, Mr Speaker, have allowed others to discuss the subject during this debate, I should like to say a few words regarding it. It goeswithout saying that every one desires that the land shall carry as much population as possible. We desire that our lands shall be put to the best uses. If the object of the Bill is to burst up large estates, why is not that stated in its preamble? There is no statement to that effect in the measure, because it is known that this Parliament has no constitutional right to legislate for the subdivision of land. Honorable members opposite are trying to do by a sidewind what they cannot do directly. It is very popular to advocate in cities and other crowded centres, the taxation of largeestates, because to do so appeals to the envy of those who do not own land, or own so little that they are exempt from taxation.

It might as well pick the pockets of the land-owners as compel them to part with their land by imposing taxation to lower its value. would be improper if those who now hold the land had obtained it for the traditional bottle of rum, and had been drawing large rentals from it ever since, though there would then be something to mitigate a feeling against the land-holding class. But, as a matter of fact, most of those who hold land have paid high prices for it . The profits from landed property are not nearly so great as some honourable members would have it appear. .£50 a bank share nominally worth only .£10 is getting a much smaller return from his investment than the bare statement of the dividend rate of the bank might lead one to think, and so it is with the landholder. Why should it be more unsafe to invest money in land than in any other security ? Hitherto land has been regarded as the safest investment, and a loan on the security of a mortgage has been considered the best protected advance that could be made. But the policy of the Labour party is to change this, and to make land the worse property that a man can have. The present dominant party in the Legislature looks with an envious eye upon the land-owners, notwithstanding the fact that they have lawfully acquired what they possess. have even heard them called robbers. If a blow is struck at the foundation of the ownership of land, or of anything else, no good will result, either to the party which strikes it , or to the country. No doubt, those who are envious, of the large land-holders favour the proposed tax, and they are told, "" It will not affect you, because even if you hold land it will come within the £ 5 , 0 0 0 exemption."" Had the Labour party declared that there should be no exemption, but that the unimproved value of all land would be taxed, their proposal would not have received the ready acceptance which it has received. The reason for the exemption seems to be to get the votes of the smaller land-holders.

If we had the constitutional right to legislate to provide for closer settlement, the proposals of the Government might be viewed differently. But, in any case, I would ask how the taxing of land in towns and cities can increase settlement? land is in almost every case being put to the best use, and cannot be taxed except for revenue purposes. to which I have referred there is no reference to revenue taxation. Apparently, since it was issued it has been thought dangerous to give too much prominence to the -desire to bring about the subdivision of estates, and therefore to make the Bill constitutional it is being referred to as one to impose a tax for revenue purposes.

In view of the urgent necessity for encouraging an influx of suitable immigrants to the Commonwealth in order to more effectively develop its great resources and defend it against possible invasion, My Advisers intend to adopt a policy which it is confidently believed will, by making fertile land available, speedily induce very large numbers of people of the right kind to settle on the lands of the Commonwealth. We have not yet heard what means are to be adopted to carry out that very desirable object.

In order to show that the proposal for a Federal land tax, with an exemption of £5,000, as first made af a Labour Conference, was not designed to raise revenue, I would point out that at the Brisbane Conference on 7th July, 1908, a Mr Grant, quoting Mr J. C. Watson, the late Leader of the Federal Labour party, saidA progressive land tax was not for revenue but for the bursting up of large estates. That is clear enough.

VVe are on delicate ground when we attempt to impose taxation with an ulterior object. As the honourable member for Ballarat said the other night, if the power of taxation can be used to control land occupation and land settlement in the States, it can be used for any other purpose with the object of encroaching on the powers of thc States. We have been told over and over again that the object of this Bill is not revenue, but the bursting up of large estates and land settlement; and if these can be brought about by indirect means, I do not know where the Constitution is, so far as the integrity of the States is concerned. It is the old story of the husbandman and the viper over again. Honourable members will remember the fable of a husbandman who went out to till the soil in the early morning, and saw a viper benumbed by the cold, and in pity put it in his bosom; and when the warmth of his body had restored the creature, it turned on him and inflicted a mortal wound. That is what the Labour party are trying to do-to inflict a mortal wound on those who gave us the Constitution. That is the way the States are being rewarded by honourable members opposite for the Constitution and Parliament which they so generously gave us. It is intended little by little to destroy the States, and, right or wrong, to attain by devious steps what cannot be attained directly. Let mc read what Mr Phelps, a Minister of the United States, said in the Nineteenth Century of February, 1888, in regard to the relations between the Commonwealth and the States in America. His words are as applicable to us as to the United StatesThe cardinal idea upon which the Constitution moment I did not answer, as it seemed is founded is that every State retains its f u l l sovereignty except so far as by the express terms to me an important statement coming from of the Constitution or by necessary implication the Attorney-General. He said that under certain powers are relinquished by the States or the Constitution we imposed Customs conferred upon the Federal Government. In duties, but that it did hot say anydetermining, therefore, in which jurisdiction any governmental power resides, the innuinis, whething about the effect that they were to ther it has been parted with by the States, under have, whether protective or otherwise. the provisions of the Constitution, and if so, Both he and honourable members oppowhether it has heen granted to the national Gosite seem to think that was an all-sufficient: vernment. If we follow the opinion of Mr Phelps we docile majority. They thought they had shall be all right. VVe have to determine in scored a point, and, as I did not reply, what jurisdiction any governmental power they probably went home convinced that resides; and I have not heard any one who they had put a good poser to me. But the pretends to be an authority say that the Sir John Forrest. control, disposition, management, subdivision, and settlement of the land belong to the Federal Legislature. VVe have to ask ourselves whether this was a power parted with by the States under the provisions of the Constitution, and, if so, was it' granted to the Commonwealth? To this there can be only one answer-No, it was not. I do not intend to refer to the question of the validity of the Bill, which will have to be decided hereafter; what concerns me is the state of mind and thought of a great party in this country who will allow their conscience to be so warped as to allow them to be led into devious paths, as must be apparent to every one who has fairly and honestly considered this matter. The object' in view is no doubt thought to advance the political interests of that party, and, as I have said in this House before, and proved up to the hilt, the end is deemed to justify the means. There is no doubt that all the risks in the Bill are taken in the attempt to invade the arena of the States on that principle. On the 6th July last, in some remarks I made on the Address-in-Reply, I gave my views in regard to land legislation. I then expressed the opinion that the States retain all power in regard to land management and control; that they have never parted with that power, and that it consequently does not belong to the Commonwealth ; that this Parliament has no power to legislate in regard to the way lands shall be held and used; and that"" if we cannot legislate directly, we should not seek to invade the arena reserved to the States, by endeavouring indirectly to attain the same object. I am sorry the Attorney-General is not present, because, when I was speaking on that occasion, the honourable gentleman said there was nothing in the Constitution which allowed protection through the Customs. For the answer; and it was cheered by the cases are not at all analogous, as I will to do by a round-about process what honshow.

That provision will cover mining, banking, land, and insurance companies, and will make them all absentees under the Act, notwithstanding that in many cases most of the shareholders live here. Another most unfair and unusual provision concerning which I :im surprised at the action of the Government, is the attempt to dive into the pocket of the unfortunate land-owner sooner than is fair or reasonable, by making the Bill retrospective. It might have been expected that the Bill would begin to operate when it passed the Legislature, or on the ist January, 1911; but the Treasurer has got used to making laws retrospective. He made a previous Bill retrospective, and I suppose he thinks he can do the same with this, but he will search a long way before he finds a taxation measure taking effect prior to the date when it was introduced. I hope that blot upon the Bill will also be removed. Another most unfair provision is that by which all the properties held by one firm or person throughout Australia are aggregated. A bank, for instance, has property in all the capital cities and principal towns of Australia, but these are to be dealt with as a whole, in order to obtain more from them, by making only the one exemption of £5,000 apply to them instead of an exemption for every State. That applies also to other properties. generously with public institutions, which, although they may be carried on for the private gain of shareholders, are still doing a great deal of useful work, and supplying a great want to the whole community. They should be treated honestly and generously, instead of their properties being amalgamated, so as to prevent them getting the benefit of the .£5,000 exemption in each State. It is not worthy of the Government, and I am surprised to find them lending themselves to such legislation. Then, again, they induce the owner to overvalue his property from the fear, not only of being fined a ridiculous amount, but also of having the property forfeited. It is all very well to say that this provision will not have the effect I indicate, but we do not want to trust any one's generosity or kindness. know where we are. We do not want to be penalized, or to have to over-value our property. Where there are municipal or State valuations it is easy enough to take them, but to say that an owner has to value his property, and that if he values it at less than other people think it is worth, he is liable to have it forfeited, or to be otherwise penalized, is not British fair play. Cannot the Department value the properties themselves where there is no municipal or State valuation? It was done in a very fair way in Western Australia.. The Department let the owner take the value from the municipal or shire council rolls, and pay the tax accordingly. They then took time during the year to revise the amounts, and where a man under-valued they made a claim on him, and he had to pay it, or appeal. knows that all the shire lands are grossly undervalued. provided for in the Western Australian system in the way I have described. All this drastic legislation seems to infer that people who own property are dishonest. It seems to me to indicate that in the opinion of honourable members opposite persons who have property have no right to possess it, and that they wish to make it as difficult as possible for land-holders to retain their estates. I have no hesitation in saying that the whole of the previsions regarding penalties to be inflicted . for mistakes, and under valuations, and other matters connected therewith, are harsfc It is not dealing fairly or and confiscatory. Yet those vindictive provisions are in the forefront of this measure. I cannot understand the meaning of this crusade against land-owners. Is it prompted by envy? Is it due to the fact that some people have been more successful in the battle of life than have others? Listening to honourable members opposite, I should say that envy is at the bottom of this movement. But it will never be possible to bring about equality of mankind. Burke rightly called the idea of equality "" a monstrous fiction."" There will always, I fear, be people occupying different stations in the world. It has been so from the beginning, and I expect that it will continue to be so to the endunless the millennium, for which we hope, We ought to be attained.

415,Sir John Forrest,"That wasin many cases by their self-denial-hav e made a competence for themselves, should be singled out for almost vindictive attack. This is the worse advertisement Australia has ever had. What will be the effect when it is known that the Parliament of this country is making a crusade against those who own property? I have no sympathy whatever with persons who possess land and do not use it. In Western Australia .1. introduced laws for dealing with the evil of land aggregation and putting it to sufficient use. confiscation and in taking away from a man that which he has lawfully obtained. every inducement should be given to people to take up land. That is what we want. Certainly during the last few years prices have been high and the use of fertilizers has made the land much more profitable than it was hitherto. My honourable friend, the Postmaster-General, knows that foe many a long year the lands in the northern part of South Australia, where people are doing well now, were occupied by those who were nearly always in serious trouble. Those were bad times, when prices wer: low and droughts were common. When I was Premier of Western Australia. I did my best to induce people to settle our lands We gave settlers land and lent them money to develop it; but the progress was slow. But now a change has come, and occupation is more profitable. This land tax will discourage settlement. Yet we are sending lecturers throughout the world who are drawing pictures of the vast virgin areas of Australia, and endeavouring to induce people to come to our shores. They are told that we have 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 of square miles of country, for the most part unalienated from the Crown. these stories that are told about Australia are probably exaggerated. But still it must be recognised that there is immense scope for settlement. undoubtedly have to be done before the interior of Australia is settled. There are immense areas on Cooper's Creek and the Barcoo,. which will have to be brought under cultivation in the future by irrigation. The honourable member for Denison has told us that he knows of land near Burnie which has been settled for a hundred years, but which is not fully utilized. these small plots are not easily available for himself and his friends; but let him Sir John Forrest. do as the early pioneers did. Let them go out to Cooper's Creek, for example, and fight their way as the earlier settlers in Australia had to do, and not sit down at Burnie and expect the strawberries and apples to fall into their mouths. As showing that I have no sympathy with land being held and not used, I invite honourable members to search the land laws of Western Australia. While1 was Commissioner of Lands there, in 1887. 1 was instrumental in passing laws whicb But I do not believe in are in operation to this day, and which prevented any one from taking up more than from 1,000 to 2,000 acres. No large In a new country like this estates are provided for in those laws. honourable member break up the big estates ? big estates to break up. I am talking Of the new lands that were opened for settlement under the land laws passed while 1 was Commissioner. We purchased land ;iloug the railway, and we settled hundreds of families in places where previously the land had only been used for pastoral puiposes. I mention this to show that I am in sympathy with thu object in view, but .1 do not believe in attaining our object by methods which are not only unconstitutional, but also dishonest in principle. proposed if it is unconstitutional. proposed amounts to a breach of good faith if it be not legally wrong. The States entered into this compact as friends. But what are we trying to do now ? We are trying to invade the legislative arena that belongs exclusively to them. The Postmaster-General knows that as well as I do. I would not say a word Many of against rhis proposal if it were necessary to tax land for revenue purposes. But we have continually heard it asserted that the object is to burst up the big esGreat things will tates. I heard the honourable member for Denison say that that was the object. It is of no use to adopt a make-believe attitude. I believe in a proper use of the land, but I do not believe in doing a wrong and defrauding any one. I do not subscribe to the principle that the end justifies the means. I would not do that which is wrong to the States, even in order to carry out a scheme for more closely He supports this Bill because settling the lands of this country.

419,Sir John Forrest,"What is nowwant more power with regard to land legislation,""' and I would use that power if the people liked to give it. But I would not attain my object by doing indirectly what we have no power to do directly. The States are as anxious as we are that there shall be closer settlement. But what is the use of talking about a land tax inducing closer settlement in Western Australia, where excellent freehold land can be purchased privately for £ 2 or £ 3 an acre, and Crown lands can be obtained at ios. an acre, payable in twenty annual instalments? Along the railways now about to be constructed there are millions of acres of land which are not even surveyed. The Government are unable to get sumcient surveyors to do the work. They have advertised for fifty or sixty more surveyors although they already have about a hundred engaged. Therefore to talk about closer settlement in Western Australia being brought about by this land tax is merely to talk for the purpose of making political capital. WereI a member of a State Parliament, I would legislate, if necessary, for the compulsory purchase of land, where owners would not subdivide, and insist on compulsory improvements should freehold lands be held and not utilized, a proposition I once made in Western Australia, where J brought in a Bill for that purpose, the fines for non-compliance with its provisions to be used for the making of roads and railways, the providing of water supplies, and the general development of the country. I have not heard it stated by honourable members opposite what area they think a family should hold. The Bill exempts all land of a less value than £5,000; but less than 100 acres in Warrnambool might be more valuable than over 10,000 acres in some other place. If the object of the Bill is, as has been urged by the honourable member for Denison, to provide for closer settlement, why tax the town lands, whose owners already contribute to the cost of municipal and State government? I read in the newspaper the other day that it is now proposed-and probably the cry will be taken up,"" as many of these cries arethat rents should be determined by arbitration tribunals. members opposite think that the way to cheapen rents in towns is to tax the land, not once or twice, but three times. The honourable member for Corangamite, speaking on the Address-in-Reply, saidWe have turned down a page of our history regarding much of which we need say very little, head of population in Australia. In the because it is best forgotten. That is all a new member, speaking for the first time in this august assembly, had to say of the work of those who have gone before. Is that gratitude? It would not seem to be. The honourable member appears to have no regard for those who bore the burden and heat of the day, and by their energy and ability made Australia what it is. If those who came here in the early days, and have spent their lives here, need a monument to their energy, determination, and enterprise, it is to be found in the development of the country. The railways, roads, and other public works of Australia are a reply to ungenerous remarks such as that which I have quoted. Where is the necessity for this drastic legislation? Are the people of Australia down-trodden ? be. member does not seem to be down-trodden, nor do his fellow members. Many in this House have at one time or another been hewers of wood and drawers of water. Nearly every honourable member, to some extent, has been the architect of his own fortune. I heard a member of this House, a few weeks ago, say that he left his pick and shovel to enter Parliament. What stronger evidence could there be of the opportunities which are open to those who are careful, energetic, and enterprising? Like the soldiers of the great Napoleon, every one of whom, he said, carried in his knapsack a marshal's baton, every member of this community can-rise to a position ofinfluence and affluence. In every part of the House are men who have made their own way in the world. Then, what is the reason for this pessimistic and drastic legislation? Have the people not done well iri this new country? have done better than the honourable member, who has already attained one of the highest places. In his wildest' flights of imagination a few years' ago, he did not dream that he would Apparently, honourable ever attain the position which he now occupies. But other members of the House have the like possibilities. What is the position of the State of Victoria, in whose capital this Parliament assembles?

Notwithstanding the fact that the whole of the public debt of the State of Victoria was not spent on reproductive works, practically the whole interest bill is covered by the return from such works. The value of the production of Australia was estimated at £165,000,000 for 1908, or £ 3 9 per head of population. This production was made up as follows: -Agriculture , £[48,000,000; dairying, forestry and mining, £ 2 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 ; manufactures, £ 3 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; which makes the total I have stated. This shows that the pastoral industry produces annually about the same value as the agricultural and dairying industry; ancl yet no honourable member opposite has a kind word to say for those engaged in it . The production in Australia is far greater per head than in any other part of the world, and proves that the persons engaged in production from land are doing more in Australia than are the same number in any other country. These facts furnish a good reason for not embarking on schemes to disturb the prosperity, of the country, and for not increasing the burdens of a section of the community. not attempt to reduce the value of property. To reduce the value of a man's property by taxation is as bad as it would be to defraud him of the money at his credit in a bank.
