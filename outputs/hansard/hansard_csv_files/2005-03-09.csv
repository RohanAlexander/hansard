204,The Speaker,"Order! It being 8 p.m.,Wednesday, 9 March 2005 ----Health Insurance: Premiums cern to the people of the electorate of Hindmarsh, which I represent. Last week this government gave yet another stamp of approval to an increase in health insurance premiums-the fourth consecutive premium increase for private health funds. At almost eight per cent it is the highest increase since the introduction of the private health rebate, which was meant to make private health insurance more affordable. It is now about 33 per cent more expensive, and people have been calling my office to let me know that they cannot afford it. But because of this government’s attitude towards Medicare-it has reigned over a dramatic fall in bulkbilling rates-and its failure to adequately respond to the growing needs of the public health system, most people feel that private health insurance is a necessity. As such, allowing health insurance companies to continually jack up the price adds insult to injury, and I will be having a lot more to say about this matter. Indeed, one constituent has already advised me that she wishes to circulate a petition against the price increase for me to table in the House. She and her family are doing their sums at the moment to see whether or not they can afford to keep their insurance. These price hikes are putting Australia on a path towards an Americanised health system where only the rich can afford to be healthy. Such a system is, quite simply, un-Australian. The government’s promise to make private health insurance ‘more affordable and attractive’ has been proved to be yet another broken promise. I am amazed that this government can say in one breath that it will make health insurance more affordable and, in the next, say that there is nothing it can do to stop premiums increasing this year and perhaps into the future. In fact, I think it expects increases. People in my electorate of Hindmarsh now have to decide what they will go without so they can make ends meet after the health insurance premium rise. This government shrugs its shoulders as if it cannot possibly go in to bat for Australians who fork out their money for health insurance because our public health system has been regarded with disinterest. Private health insurance is now 33 per cent more expensive than it was in 2001, which wipes out the government’s 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. The government has just put a rubber stamp on the rises on every occasion. This government needs to get in there and battle for the consumers. That is currently not happening, and the incentives we had four years ago have been gobbled up by health insurance companies. Furthermore, the promise that more Australians would go into private cover has proved to be incorrect. That means there is no easing of the pressure on the public system, and younger people who do not use their health insurance very often are going to drop out. As a community we have a responsibility to look after people, whether they have private funds or not. We have an absolute responsibility to ensure that everyone has good health services. In order to relieve pressure on the public health system we need to negotiate with health care providers on behalf of consumers.

I can guarantee the health insurance companies, who are on a nice little earner, will not suddenly find their consciences. (Time expired). Wakefield Electorate: Gawler River ple of Wakefield. There are a number of river systems flowing into the Gawler River, which is in close proximity to urban areas as well as to the agricultural areas of the Adelaide Plains, where the river is elevated and contained by banks. The river has flooded a number of times, and in 1992 floods caused over $12 million worth of damage. There has been a multimillion dollar scheme proposed which will go a long way to alleviate damage from major flooding which occurs, on average, every 10 years. This scheme will be a sound investment in the future of the Gawler River catchment district and also, importantly, to the businesspeople who live in that area. A major element of the scheme is the construction of a flood control dam on the North Para River near Turretfield. Last year the Australian government provided $200,000 for the design of the dam. Other elements involve modifying the South Para Reservoir to provide flood attenuation storage, undertaking environmentally sensitive channel maintenance and provision of a controlled alternate flow path along the lower reaches of the Gawler River. The economic and social benefits to our communities gained from effective flood mitigation measures should not be underestimated. Australia wide, it is estimated that flooding has an annual cost of more than $370 million, quite apart from the distress to families and communities because of disruption to their livelihoods and businesses. Commitment by all three spheres of government to the Regional Flood Mitigation Program represents a sound investment in the protection of Australian communities. The Regional Flood Mitigation Program assists state and territory governments and local agencies to implement priority, cost-effective flood mitigation works and measures. It is delivered through a partnership between all levels of government. I am pleased that the Gawler flood mitigation scheme will benefit from a further $384,000 in Australian government funding this financial year. The funds build on a previous $550,000 invested in the scheme, bringing the total commitment today to $934,000. The issue I wish to raise is that local governments, in particular, struggle with this scheme when the infrastructure costs become high, because they have limited rate bases in some cases-like the district of Mallala or, indeed, any of the councils that have capped rate bases. Because the outcome is important to the people of Wakefield, I will be looking to continue work with all levels of government to address this important project and to find a funding formula through either the flood mitigation scheme or other options will enable us to build this important measure for the people of Wakefield.

My first reaction was to throw this in the garbage bin and treat it with the contempt it deserves, but then I thought that some of the statements in this pamphlet, which is being circulated in the community, should be responded to in the House and be recorded in Hansard. It is a diatribe of unsupported facts, of prejudice, of bias, of racism and of religious bigotry. It quotes selectively from the Koran and quotes out of context. It talks about all Muslims in gross generalisations, saying, ‘Muslims, on their own admission, have world rule as their goal.’ It says-and this is perhaps the most offensive-‘It is as much a political system as was Nazism and Communism. More repressive of those who don’t accept its rule, more repressive than the Nazi regime and the Communist regimes, which have imprisoned, tortured and killed thousands of people.’ All religions are entitled to conduct their activities and all people of all religions are entitled to conduct their beliefs without hatred and without abuse. This pamphlet, which is being circulated by this group called the Free Australia movement, is highly offensive, is ignorant and talks about our politicians being ignorant by continuing to accept Muslim migrants into Australia. However, this pamphlet is the most ignorant piece of communication I have read in many years. If the authors of this pamphlet were prepared to come to any electorate and meet hard working, decent Muslims who believe in religious freedom and secularism, I am sure that they would find it a very educational activity. I do not have many members of the Muslim faith in my electorate. It is not a matter of that; it is a matter of freedom of speech and freedom of religion. I support freedom of speech, and I believe people as ignorant and as abusive as this have the right to freedom of speech, but I think it is also incumbent on members of the House to correct the record, to correct this vile piece of bigotry which is being sent into the community and to say to members of the Muslim community in our nation, ‘You are welcome, you are valued and we will continue to value you and your contribution to our nation.’ Gilmore Electorate: Vocational Education and Training ister for Vocational and Technical Education, Gary Hardgrave, for a community consultation forum in Wollongong on the Australian technical colleges. The Illawarra and the New South Wales South Coast, into which my electorate of Gilmore falls, is one of 24 locations earmarked for an ATC. As the minister can testify, there is widespread interest in ATCs in the Illawarra and, indeed, along the South Coast and southern highlands, which in this instance also falls in the Illawarra catchment. The minister has seen first-hand how the colleges have captured the imagination of industry leaders, educators and students. However, using the meeting in Wollongong on Friday, 25 February as an example, the minister also heard that there are pockets of concern. Representatives of the New South Wales TAFE Teachers Association used the forum to air grievances over the future of TAFE funding levels in a very negative fashion. It can only be said that, while the concerns were delivered concisely and vigorously, the balancing opinions of representatives from the likes of the Motor Traders Association and the Australian Industry Group were overwhelmingly positive and refreshing to hear.

209,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (9.49 A.m.),"Two weeks ago I had the pleasure of hosting the Minmeet community needs’ and ‘No one model fits all and I’m not about to tell anyone what their proposal should look like’, which were particularly well received, as was the willingness to assist with the viability and practicality of adding virtual colleges into the mix of ATC college proposals. Local industries are particularly keen to see the colleges target specific areas of need. There is support for the colleges, but the need to address the recent skills shortage in specified key areas is also a motivating factor for those who in the end will be responsible for running the local ATC board and for putting up dollars to back the students. Such is the interest in the Illawarra in Australian technical colleges that several expressions of interest have been lodged. However, there can at this stage be only one Australian technical college in the Illawarra; therefore, in the weeks to come there will be a mood of greater cooperation within the region. A comprehensive single proposal is not only possible but increasingly probable. As the process moves towards a formal request for tenders, I look forward to witnessing the cooperation of industry representatives and educators across the Illawarra as they go about putting together an Australian technical college proposal second to none in the country. I am pleased to say that the member for Throsby, the member for Cunningham and I are working together in unison towards this very worthwhile proposal. Transport: Infrastructure parliament the growing crisis of serious traffic congestion in Sydney and Australia’s major cities. My constituents in Lowe-and indeed people throughout Sydney and undoubtedly all of Australia’s major cities, whether they travel to work by public transport or private carknow of the problem of traffic congestion and its effect on their quality of life and productivity and also its negative impact on our environment. I was grateful to receive a letter last week from the General Manager of the City of Canada Bay, Mr Michael McMahon, asking me to lend my support to the council’s campaign for a high-quality mass transit network, specifiGovernments be urged to allocate funding for the establishment of a light rail network for Inner Sydney given benefits to the economy and the environment’. The August 1999 Bureau of Transport Economics report titled Urban transport: looking ahead shows that private road vehicles represent 93 per cent of city passenger transport in Australia. The traffic congestion that this brings has a very negative impact on our economy. This document also estimates that traffic congestion will cost the Australian economy ‘around $30 billion per year by 2015’. This is a problem that must be addressed across all levels of government, and there is ample precedent of Commonwealth funding of mass transit and light rail projects. The Whitlam government provided funds under the States Grants (Urban Public Transport) Act 1974. This act ratified an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states to upgrade urban public transport in major cities and for the Commonwealth to provide two-thirds of the cost of approved projects. Likewise, the Fraser government provided for the spending of $300 million from 1978-79 under the States Grants (Urban Public Transport) Act 1978. Under the Hawke and Keating governments the Australian Land Transport Development Program saw $222 million committed for urban public transport which included the extension of rail electrification in Sydney.

Teenage Pregnancy Health: Sexually Transmitted Infections Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration (9.54 a.m.)-I want to talk today about some very serious issues that affect Australia’s young people. Teenage pregnancy has significant lifetime implications for both the mothers and their children. Research has shown that children born to teenagers are more likely to grow up in poverty, be the victims of drug and alcohol misuse, become teenage parents themselves and to become involved in crime. Teenage mothers are more likely to suffer from depression, be dependent on welfare and live in poverty. Obviously it is difficult to separate how much of the social disadvantage associated with teenage pregnancy is a result of their pre-existing socioeconomic disadvantage and how much is a consequence of the young age of the parents. We need to bear this in mind when we are developing strategies to help our teenagers to get the very best advice about their own sexual reproductive health and about contraception. It is particularly difficult in rural and regional areas to get access to contraceptive information and advice. There is a tyranny of distance. You can imagine a young person who wants to go to a local GP, and who wants confidentiality, asking their parent to drive them to the nearest town. The parent would obviously want to know why the young person wants to go to a doctor-all caring parents would. The young person would need to be able to make an upfront payment, especially in most rural and regional areas where bulk-billing rates are very low. Fortunately bulk-billing rates are now increasing due to the very much improved Medicare rebate incentives offered to rural and regional doctors, but it is still the case that too often you need to pay up front before you can access a doctor. Often the doctor you see is male, they are often older, they may be from a non-Australian background and their own upbringing as an overseas trained doctor is such that they do not understand Australian teenage sexuality. It would be quite confronting to have a 13or 14-year-old in your surgery asking for advice on contraception when you have a very different upbringing and understanding yourself. In Australia, we have sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, that are often asymptomatic and can remain undetected for a significant period of time. For example, chlamydia is one such infection. We know that up to 40 per cent of those infected with chlamydia can develop a pelvic inflammatory disease that can result ultimately in infertility, ectopic pregnancy and chronic pelvic pain. We need our young people, especially our rural and regional youth, to understand STIs and we need special services which target them with medical advice and information from people who can relate and empathise with them in their age category and understand their social mores and the peer group pressures that exist, especially for gay and lesbian teenagers. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE members’ statements has concluded. Cognate bills: Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 March, on motion by Mr Brough: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Swan moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its: (1) dishonest promises during the 2004 election campaign that it would keep interest rates low; (2) short-term, reckless spending during the lead up to the 2004 election, which is adding to inflationary and interest rate pressures; (3) gross neglect of Australia’s education and training needs, leaving Australia with a skills crisis which is adding to inflationary and interest rate pressures; and (4) failure to secure Australia’s economic future by making the long-term policy commitments that will improve the productivity and competitiveness of the Australian economy”. which I commenced last night, on the appropriation bills. When I finished speaking last night, I was talking about the relationship and the contrast between the Australian economy and the economy of Ireland. The Howard-Costello government boast about 14 years of uninterrupted economic growth. That is not actually quite true: they actually boast about eight years of economic growth; they do not mention the economic growth which occurred under the Hawke and Keating years. I remember their as in the election campaign said ‘eight years of economic growth’, like it magically started in March 1996 and not that it had commenced under the Hawke and Keating governments. The Irish economy is now celebrating its 19th year of economic growth. As I said last night, the history of the Irish and Australian economies in the 1980s and 1990s is very similar. They both embraced telecommunications reform, they both embraced fiscal reform and brought down budget surpluses for the first time, and they both embraced micro-economic reform. Where they differed was in the late 1990s, when the Irish government continued with its reform. It has embraced research and development and it has embraced labour force participation. Both Ireland and Australia had participation rates of about 60 per cent in the early 1980s. The participation rate in Australia edged up to 63.5 per cent in 2003-04, but Ireland’s has surpassed this at 70 per cent. This government has ignored the disincentives to labour force participation. It has ignored the disincentives to move from welfare to work. The Labor Party took to the election a policy to change those disincentives and to provide people at the lower end of the income scale with incentives to move into work. This government has ignored that. The Irish government has embraced labour force participation and has seen its labour force participation rate surpass 70 per cent.

213,Mr Bowen (Prospect) (9.58 A.m.),"I am pleased to be able to continue my remarks,The other area of contrast is in research and development. This government’s contribution to research and development has been to abolish the research and development tax concession. The Irish government, in contrast, started Enterprise Ireland, the Science Foundation of Ireland and the National Microelectronics Research Centre, which have all developed over the last five years excellent records and reputations of embracing innovative research, of reaching out to industry and promoting companies that are innovative and promoting research like biotech and other technological advancements which have made the Irish economy one of the envies of the world when it comes to exports. As I mentioned last night, the Australian economy is labouring under a current account deficit which is now seven per cent of gross domestic product-the highest it is has ever been. We heard former Treasurer Keating talk about a banana republic when it hit six per cent. Now that it has hit seven per cent perhaps it is the big banana republic, not just the banana republic. The Irish current account deficit is effectively in balance. Their unemployment rate is now four per cent, down from 17 per cent, whereas Australia’s has fallen to five per cent from 10 per cent. So, while the government talks about its economic record, it really does not like to compare and contrast it with the economic record of other nations which have achieved higher rates of economic growth, which have reduced their inflation to a figure below ours and reduced unemployment to a figure below ours, have embraced research and development, have embraced labour force participation and have really continued the reform process and not rested on the achievements of the 1980s and the 1990s. Australia’s economic growth record of 14 years is impressive, but 19 years is even more impressive. As I said, while the Howard government likes to pretend that economic growth started miraculously in March 1996, it has of course been continuing for much longer than that and was started under the Hawke and Keating governments. I would like to turn now to some more local issues to do with the appropriation bills. While talking about information technology in relation to the contrast between the Australian and the Irish economies, it is perhaps appropriate that I talk about information technology a bit closer to home, in the Prospect electorate. Small businesses rely on fast and reliable Internet access to fulfil their business obligations in this day and age. To have fast and reliable Internet access you need ADSL broadband. Most of my electorate has access to ADSL broadband, as do the electorates of most honourable members, certainly in the metropolitan areas. However, there are parts of my electorate, in the rural areas of Prospect, which do not have this access. Kemps Creek, Cecil Park, Mount Vernon and Horsley Park have up until now not received Telstra broadband access. I am also rising today to thank Telstra for working with me to extend broadband ADSL access to the towns of Horsley Park and to parts of Cecil Park, and I thank Wayne Rhodes, Sophie Khouchaba and James Dwyer from Telstra’s north-west metropolitan office. I arranged a petition from over 100 people to ask Telstra to install broadband access into Horsley Park, and Telstra agreed to that request. I am now working with the Kemps Creek community and with the Labor Party candidate for Werriwa, Mr Chris Hayes, whose electorate also covers part of Kemps Creek, to have broadband extended to the Kemps Creek part of my electorate.

214,Mr Danby,"He’ll be a good member.tivist. He has been working with me to get Telstra to extend broadband to Kemps Creek. I am hopeful that Telstra will come to the party, and I would like to thank Sam D’Marco of Telstra for his cooperation thus far. There are many people who run small businesses in Kemps Creek. Just as importantly there are many families with university students and school students who tell me that their internet access constantly drops out and that they have to dial up constantly to do their homework and their research projects. Alternatively, they can get a satellite which costs many thousands of dollars and is almost as unreliable as the broadband dial-up service. All they want is the same access to broadband as the rest of Sydney-they live 40 kilometres from the Sydney CBD in the electorate of Prospect and I think they deserve that access. I will continue to call on Telstra to extend the access of ADSL broadband to the people of Kemps Creek, Mount Vernon and Cecil Park. I thank Telstra for their cooperation so far, and together with Chris HayesI am confident that we can achieve a result. While on local issues, I would like to talk about the appropriations for settlement services, a very important issue in the Prospect electorate as in many other electorates, including the electorate of Grayndler, for example. I mentioned in my first contribution to the House of Representatives that recently in Prospect we have received the latest round of migration, refugees from the Sudan and also from Congo and other African nations who have been through such heart-wrenching tragedies in recent years. I would like to talk a little today about the issues facing the Sudanese people in their settlement services and the need for the government to take more action to assist the Sudanese people. I recently contacted a Sudanese women’s support group and asked them to come to my electorate office to talk to me about the issues facing the Sudanese people. I have lived in a multicultural area all my life but I do not mind admitting that I was shocked to hear some of the concerns that they have and some of the issues that they are going through. I thought that after nine years on the Fairfield council dealing with many ethnic groups I had heard it all. But I was wrong; I had not heard it all. I think that as a parliament we need to reach out to people who are going through these problems to work with them as they try to settle into the Australian community. I am going to share with the House some of the problems that the Sudanese people in my electorate and other electorates are facing in their settlement process. The Sudanese women’s group mentioned to me that many of them are single mothers. This, at first, might sound unsurprising. Then they tell you the reason they are single motherstheir husbands were all killed in the crisis in the Sudan. They have come to Australia, sometimes with seven or eight children. They live in small apartments and flats around Fairfield and other areas. They do not speak English. I asked them about the health issues and whether they felt comfortable in going to English-speaking doctors. I was shocked by the answer. They told me that the biggest health crisis facing the Sudanese people is rickets. You would be shocked to think that in 21st century Sydney we would be having members of our community suffering from rickets. The Sudanese women who, as I said, do not speak English are not aware that rickets is a problem which can be relatively easily treated by Australian doctors. Rickets was contracted by their children in refugee camps in Egypt due to lack of light and lack of good food. They are unaware that rickets is a medical problem which can be treated. Some of them think it is a deformity. Others think nothing can be done about it. MAIN COMMITTEE",173,Appropriation Bill No 4 2004 2005 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 2 2004 2005
215,Mr Bowen,"He will be an excellent member. He is a very hard-working community acThe other issue is schooling. Many members of the Sudanese community are not literate in English and yet we send them to an Australian school and expect them to be able to make a contribution. It goes further than that. Not only are many of them not literate in English; many of them are not literate in any language and many of them have not been to any school environment in their whole lives. They come to Australia aged 14 or 15, turn up at school and sit in a room, and the discipline of sitting in a room and learning for eight hours is completely foreign to them. Last week I attended Holroyd High School, which has an intensive language centre. I met many Sudanese students together with many Afghani and Iraqi students who have also fled their nations. I want to pay tribute to the work of Holroyd High School and its principal, Mrs Hoddinott, for the excellent work that it does in helping members of the Sudanese community and other communities make the transition into schooling and into the Australian community. We as a community and as a nation need to do much more to help the Sudanese people in particular. They have come to Australia with problems and issues which probably go deeper than those for any other round of refugees that have come to this nation, including Lebanese and Vietnamese refugees who had been through so much. I want to pay credit where it is due. I have had several discussions about this with the honourable member for Greenway, who of course is a government member. She convened a meeting which I attended with the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs. I thank the minister for citizenship for coming to that meeting in the honourable member for Greenway’s electorate to meet with me, the honourable member for Chifley and members of the Sudanese community, and I thank the honourable member for Greenway for including me in that process. The need for more support for members of the Sudanese community, who have been through so much and who need so much support, is an issue that she and I have discussed several times. We need to have better transition into school. We need to not just have intensive English language courses for members of the Sudanese community, but have a better transition explaining the Australian schooling process so the idea of schooling is not so foreign to them. We need to have better support for rehabilitation from torture. I spoke to the principal of Fairfield High School last year and he told me about a little boy who refused to line up at school. He was a good student and willing to learn but would refuse to follow his teacher’s instructions to line up. It took some time to work out why that was. He finally opened up to the principal and said, ‘I’m not going to line up, because when we lined up at home we were lining up to be shot, and I’m not going to do it.’ Of course, that was something that the principal found very hard to deal with and something anyone in an Australian school environment would find very hard to deal with. I think we need to do much more. The minister was very open to those suggestions, and I thank him for listening to our concerns and for his willingness to take them on board. I hope he follows up that willingness with more funding for the Sudanese community and for state and local governments to support the work that they are doing in helping the Sudanese and Congolese communities to settle into the Australian way of life. They have been through so much. They have come to our nation as refugees, and we need to provide them with every support that we can. MAIN COMMITTEE It is important for the Australian government to assist in education. Members of the wider community see members of the Sudanese community walking down the street and think, ‘Where are they from?’ Often they have no concept of what these people have been through and what support we, as a community, need to give them. They are not a large community in this nation. They have not yet enrolled to vote. They are not yet fully engaged in the Australian citizenship process, and of course that is understandable. We need to reach out to them and give them every support we can. They appreciate very much the fact that Australia has made refuge available to them, but we need to do much more to make that refuge in Australia a much more sustainable and satisfying event for them. I thank the House for its time. propriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005, the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2004-2005 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2004-2005, I want to concentrate my remarks on the Howard government’s reckless environmental policies and the impact that they are having on our way of life and the kinds of jobs and the economy that we will be leaving to our children and grandchildren. It is no exaggeration to say the government’s policy on climate change places at risk many things Australians take for granted: our fantastic beaches, waterways and forests; our abundant food stocks and natural resources; and, of course, our fantastic climate, which is the envy of the world. Last Sunday, some 700,000 Australians did their bit on Clean Up Australia Day. I assisted at the Cooks River at Hurlstone Park. People from the age of 90-a gentleman who helped pick up papers along the walkway-down to little kids were there prepared to do their bit to clean up what is essentially toxic mud in the Cooks River. Undoubtedly this reflects the huge amount of goodwill in the community to help the environment. Community events such as Clean Up Australia prove this point many, many times over. Like Ian Kiernan, I believe that climate change is the greatest environmental threat to the world. Left unchecked, climate change and general environmental degradation have the potential to cripple economies and radically alter human existence on the planet. At the beginning of this century, we are at a crossroad. The science is clear and compelling: ecological decline is accelerating and many of the world’s ecosystems are reaching dangerous thresholds. Overexploitation of our natural resources, habitat loss from urbanisation and the clearing of forests for farmland, competition from introduced animals and plants, and climate change induced by a 30 per cent increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are threatening the world’s diversity. The facts are these: since the industrial revolution average global surface temperatures have risen by one degree Celsius, the most dramatic rise for over 1,000 years; the five hottest years on record have occurred in the last seven years, the 10 hottest in the last 14; snow cover has decreased 10 per cent since the 1960s; and glaciers that have not retreated since the last ice age 12,000 years ago are now doing so. The Howard government’s most significant failure is its decision to pursue an isolationist position on climate change. This issue will be front and centre of Labor’s environmental strategy. It is an issue from which others flow. The coming into effect of the Kyoto protocol on 16 February was indeed a historic event. On that day, 140 nations plus the EU joined together in a historic agreement to take international action to avoid dangerous climate change. The significance of this should not be underestimated. The Kyoto protocol is certainly not perfect, and Labor does not argue that this is the case. However, we do argue that it is a critical first MAIN COMMITTEE",174,Appropriation Bill No 4 2004 2005 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 2 2004 2005
216,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (10.13 A.m.),"In my contribution to the debate on the Apstep in addressing the climate change issue. Unlike some senior ministers in the Howard government, I believe climate change is real. Labor believes implementation of the Kyoto protocol is only the start of a truly long-term strategy, one that will be handed to our children and grandchildren. The strategy must be to work with other nations to set progressively more stringent time-bound emission targets over the next 50 years. We must assist developing countries to meet those emission reduction targets and we must build regulatory and market based systems that will see Australia meet its commitments, generate economic opportunity and provide model systems for other countries. The government will have none of those. Instead the government plays the role of the environmental sceptic and uses its transparent, tired old strategies of funding demonstration projects and R&D activities to bury the issue, such as with its proposals in last year’s flawed energy white paper. Without a doubt, reversing environmental degradation and putting our economy onto a low-carbon and sustainable footing will be amongst the most difficult issues confronting Australian governments over coming decades. Labor does not, however, accept the argument that the pursuit of environmental sustainability threatens future economic and employment growth-quite the opposite. In Spain, Denmark and Germany alone the expansion of the renewable energy sector has created about a quarter of a million new jobs in the last few years. The Howard government’s refusal to show leadership at home or be part of international efforts such as the Kyoto protocol is not only reckless environmental policy; it is also bad economic policy. It is clear that stemming environmental degradation requires, above all, leadership. What remains in doubt, however, is whether today’s political and business leaders are going to rise to the challenge or whether we simply leave the problem to future generations. It is quite clear that there are people in industry with the foresight to acknowledge that a transition to a sustainable global economy is needed. According to a Reuters news report, prominent senior Republican and former US Secretary of State James Baker, who happens to be a close ally of the Bush family, broke ranks with the Bush administration and has called for his country to get serious about global warming. In a speech to an audience including a number of oil company executives, Mr Baker said orderly change to alternative energy was needed. He told the Houston Forum Club: It may surprise you a little bit, but maybe it’s because I’m a hunter and a fisherman, but I think we need to a pay a little more attention to what we need to do to protect our environment ... When you have energy companies like Shell and British Petroleum, both of which are perhaps represented in this room, saying there is a problem with excess carbon dioxide emission, I think we ought to listen. I remind members that Mr Baker ran presidential campaigns for George Bush Sr and served in his cabinet and led George Bush Jr’s legal fight to win the Florida vote in the 2000 election. It would seem to me that at least part of the reason prominent conservatives such as James Baker are making such strong noises is the strong economic arguments for embracing emissions trading and the forms of energy production which do not damage the environment. There is no question the establishment of a domestic carbon trading scheme not only would reduce an economic dislocation caused by moving to a low carbon economy but would be a driver of new business opportunities, greater investment and job creation within the Australian economy. Putting a value on carbon will create a strong incentive to industry and business to use less and cleaner energy and will send a signal on the value of carbon in the economy. MAIN COMMITTEE Carbon trading gives companies the flexibility to meet emission targets according to their own strategy, thus offering the most cost-effective way for energy intensive industries to meet their obligation to reduce emissions. Mr Ric Brazzale, Executive Director of the Australian Business Council for Sustainable Energy, has stated: Emissions trading will actually drive jobs and investment growth in sustainable energy technologies and practices. Mr Greg Bourne, former Regional President of BP Australasia, has said: BP has considerable experience in emissions trading, supports the adoption of similar systems in the markets that it operates in, and has already shared its experience widely. Rio Tinto Australia believes: ... that market instruments, including emissions trading, offer the best chance for timely, effective and sustainable emissions reductions. BHP Billiton supports: ... the development of market-based mechanisms such as emissions trading, provided that the measures are broad-based, efficient and are phased in such that industry has time to adjust. AMP Capital has stated: While it is clear that carbon trading is not the cure-all to environmental problems in Australia, it is a step in the right direction that we believe will help both the environment and minimise costs to the business world. The Western Australian Farmers Federation has called for access to carbon trading, outlining the benefits, including revegetation and allowing agricultural industries to better manage the impact of climate change in the future. Even Treasurer Peter Costello and the former environment minister, David Kemp, supported a national trading scheme. As reported by the Australian on 21 August 2004: Federal cabinet rejected such a schemean emissions trading scheme in 2003... even though Environment Minister David Kemp and Treasurer Peter Costello promoted it, after industry lobbied John Howard. I asked the Treasurer to confirm this during question time on Kyoto Day, which he did by not refuting it. The European Union’s carbon trading scheme commenced on 1 January 2005, establishing the world’s largest market in greenhouse gas emissions. Initially, some 12,000 installations across 25 European countries will participate in the scheme. In the United Kingdom, for example, the participating installations collectively emit about half of the economy’s carbon dioxide emissions. BP introduced an internal carbon trading scheme. It cost $US20 million to implement, yet it saved $US650 million over a three-year period. In the USA a bipartisan group of northeastern governors from Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont are developing the USA’s first regional ‘cap and trade’ scheme for carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in their states. The terms of this scheme are expected to be finalised within the next few months. MAIN COMMITTEE Also in the US, the bipartisan McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship Act 2003 proposed a ‘cap and trade’ carbon trading scheme. Although it was narrowly defeated in the Senate, it received bipartisan support. It was touted as providing a moderate, affordable and effective approach to addressing global warming by reducing emissions in a market-friendly and innovative way. It has since been reintroduced to the US House of Representatives and another vote in the Senate is expected soon. Since the Kyoto protocol came into force on 16 February, it has become clear that countries such as New Zealand are taking advantage of Australia’s absence from the game. Recently, the NZ government awarded 39 renewable energy and climate change projects, with a total of 10 million government endorsed credits in return for abatement far above 10 million tonnes of greenhouse gases. These credits were awarded to project proponents by the New Zealand government under a competitive tender arrangement where project developers bid for credits on a tonnes of greenhouse gas abatement per credit basis. This will give New Zealand business a direct right to participate in international and European emissions trading. This idea was not a New Zealand policy invention but originally an Australian idea that the Kiwis picked up and ran with. It was first contemplated as Australian government policy in the Australian Greenhouse Office’s November 2000 discussion paper titled ‘Crediting for early action’, which contemplated the early draw-down of 100 million tonnes of Australia’s Kyoto credits and rewarding GHG reduction action by Australian businesses. Australia first flagged this creative approach but the Howard government dropped the ball and, as we all know, the Kiwis are pretty good at picking up a ball and running with it. New Zealand companies that have been awarded credits, such as Mighty River Power, Meridian Energy and Palmerston City Council, have sold these NZ credits or have begun negotiations with international carbon purchasers, including the Dutch government. It is worth noting carefully that an independent survey has found that New Zealand is the most attractive investment destination for Kyoto protocol projects, outranking all of the eastern European countries. Frankly, if the Kiwis look good, you could imagine Australia would be a very favourable host country for projects if it were part of the system. It is also worth noting that there are currently 82 registered or pending clean development mechanism projects, expected to generate between ¼ PLOOLRQDQG¼ELOOLRQ 7KH FOHDQ development mechanism of the Kyoto protocol is becoming an important source of new finance for projects in developing countries. Because the Howard government will not ratify Kyoto, Australian companies cannot access the clean development mechanism, and thus miss out on huge business opportunities. The clean development mechanism process creates a win-win-win situation-a win for the environment, a win for private industry, and a win for jobs. The first CDM project to be approved and registered is a Dutch funded landfill gas-to-energy project in Brazil. A gas collection system, acid-soil draining system and modular electricity generation plants are being installed at a number of landfill sites in Rio de Janeiro. Methane in the landfill gas will be combusted to produce electricity for export to the grid, and excess landfill gas will be flared. Local benefits include improved water quality, reduced risk of explosion of landfill gas, job creation and 10 per cent of electricity donated for use in schools, hospitals and in other public buildings. This project illustrates the types of projects that can be undertaken through such investment. MAIN COMMITTEE Brazil, China and India have the greatest potential for the new mechanism. India has developed more clean energy proposals than any other country, and China recently adopted a proactive approach that is expected to make it a key player. The clean development mechanism is a huge business opportunity for Australian countries. Many of these projects are located in Asia and, with the government’s current position not to ratify the Kyoto protocol, Australian business cannot participate directly in these projects, nor can they hold or trade carbon credits from these projects. It is a significant statement of the despair of the Australian companies that some of them have actually set up offshore subsidiaries. We are sending Australian companies overseas, establishing these subsidiaries so they can participate in this scheme, at a time when we are worried about our current account deficit and the issue of exports. It is worth noting that BHP Billiton won a prestigious award for best trader in the European Emissions Trading Scheme recently. It was the first company to trade under this scheme. Smart companies like BHP Billiton, Shell and BP take a look at emerging trends and see the writing on the wall. Even in George Bush’s America, energy security and the acceptance of climate change are driving the market towards efficient cars. I agree with Paul Gilding’s assessment in the Australian this week that that is one of the reasons Toyota’s market share is increasing in the US, while others are shrinking. In Australia, however, the Howard government is off the game. It is an appalling approach. It is not just anti-business and anticompetitive; it is clearly against the national interest. The most extraordinary statement. I have seen recently, which I draw to the attention of the House, is that of the federal agriculture minister, Warren Truss. In an interview in Queensland Country Life, published on 24 February this year, Mr Truss attacked the Beattie government’s tree clearing laws as ‘draconian’. This is the only reason why Australia will meet its target under the Kyoto protocol. Minister Truss said: I am told that it would have been possible to have cleared remnant vegetation at the same rate that has been occurring over the last 20 years in Queensland for another 300 years-before it became endangered. Let us just stop and think about the minister’s statement. He is saying that it is okay to keep clearing at the current rate, which was at 530,000 hectares per year, for the next 300 years. When you do the sums, that means 159 million hectares of clearing, of which 110 million hectares would be remnant vegetation. It is well known that the entire land mass of Queensland is only 173 million hectares. According to the Queensland government, if all national parks, state forests, reserves, unallocated state land and other crown land under licence are removed, that leaves only 151 million hectares of freehold and leasehold land in the entire state. Yet Minister Truss believes we should clear the lot, down to the very last tree-and not have one tree left standing in the whole of Queensland. This comes from a Queensland federal government minister. I doubt whether many of Mr Truss’s own constituents think this would be a good idea. Without wanting to put too fine a point on it, making Queensland a dustbowl would not be too good for its economy, let alone its environment. A recent study by ANSTO reported in last Friday’s Sydney Morning Herald showed that deforestation has an observable impact on rainfall. The study confirmed the long-held wisdom: if you cut down rainforest, it rains less. However, aside from the total stupidity of the minister’s statement, the problem is that it is in total conflict with the Howard government’s stated policies. On the one hand, Minister Truss MAIN COMMITTEE attacks Queensland’s tree clearing laws as draconian and says, ‘They seem beyond what is necessary to ensure biodiversity and sustainability of agriculture’ and, on the other hand, the Commonwealth government relies upon this very policy to meet its greenhouse gas emission targets. The Howard government simply cannot have it both ways. Minister Truss should be brought into line by the Prime Minister. But this is not surprising, and it is consistent with the views of the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, Minister Macfarlane, who was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on the eve of the Kyoto protocol coming into force as saying: Whether or not those emissions are causing climate change, I don’t know. If you go back across history, millions of years, carbon dioxide levels go up and down, and global warming comes and goes. I mean, the Earth is a lot warmer than it was when the glaciers formed. What a statement. Frankly, the Howard government is incredibly confused about this issue. While Labor see climate change as a serious environmental threat, we also see opportunities for new industries and new jobs. We want to participate as a part of that global economy and we want to participate as a part of taking global action against climate change. 3) 2004-2005, the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2004-2005, and in particular the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2004-2005. I would like to address my remarks to that bill to start off with. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you are aware that I have been a long time advocate of parliamentary reform in this place and I have had on the Notice Paper for many years a proposal for a staffing and appropriations committee of the House of Representatives. I cannot claim that this is my idea; it was former Senator Jessop in the mid-70s who first made that proposal. It was subsequently adopted by the Senate but continuously rejected in the House. I want to talk about how ridiculous things have become in the absence of a staffing and appropriations committee. Yesterday in the HouseI was forced to rise to ask a question of the Speaker about a changed security arrangement and access by the public to this building. I am not the only one who does that-ask questions about the Speaker’s management of the House-but currently there is absolutely no forum by which to channel these questions. Here we have the business of the House being taken up, in this case by me, asking the Speaker questions that could be sorted out in a staffing and appropriations committee. For the House, one of the biggest consequences of the lack of a staffing and appropriations committee-and I am not blaming anyone here-has, of course, been the attack on the committee system of the House of Representatives. As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who takes a great deal of interest in these matters, would know, in the last parliament the number of committees was increased but the budget was not. Have you ever heard of a proposal whereby you can magically increase the quality and effectiveness of the committee system by adding three committees but not increasing the budget and the number of personnel? When I came to this place-and I accept that there needs to be change-a parliamentary committee had a secretary, and that was not a secretary who was looking after half a dozen committees but a secretary of that committee. At the end of the day, members of parliament may feel that they are very important people who are indispensable to the committee system-and I would probably agree with that-but let us not delude ourselves: often the quality of the committee report depends on the quality and number of staff who are servicing that MAIN COMMITTEE",176,Appropriation Bill No 4 2004 2005 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 2 2004 2005
217,Mr Price (Chifley) (10.33 A.m.),"I am pleased to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No.committee. They play an indispensable role. If we keep stretching the resources of the committee system in the way we have been doing, then because we have no scrutiny of the parliament inevitably the quality of reports may decline. I think that will be to the disappointment of the Australian people, because the committee system allows them to stay in touch with the parliament and gives them a voice, often when they do not have one. I am not necessarily wedded to a staffing and appropriations committee. Our New Zealand colleagues-and they are not the only ones-have commissions of the parliament to try and give some statutory independence and provide some protection to the parliament against the executive and, in particular, the common enemy, the department of finance. We cannot be stillborn in these matters. As much as we may rejoice in 100-plus years of democracy, we need to change and adapt. Certainly the executive has over time adapted and increased, and has even more clout. If we want to protect the institution of parliament, we need to face up to reform. There are some other matters that I want to raise. I was particularly disappointed-and I think this disappointment is shared by many of my constituents-to see interest rates rise. There is no doubt that at the last election the coalition had a most effective campaign based around the concept that interest rates would remain very low, and historically so. I do not know why we in Australia brag about low interest rates when so many countries have much lower interest rates. I have a chart here-I will not wave it around, because I do not want to get in trouble; I have great respect for the chair and the standing orders-which demonstrates quite clearly that in the developed world New Zealand is the only country with higher interest rates. The UK has lower interest rates and the United States has lower interest rates. Canada, Germany, Sweden, Greece, Austria, France, Italy, Portugal, Ireland and Belgium all have lower interest rates. Spain has lower interest rates. Finland has lower interest rates than Australia. The Netherlands has lower interest rates. Japan has lower interest rates. The interest rate in the Netherlands is three per cent. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I am sure there are a lot of constituents in your electorate and even in the electorate of the honourable member for Forrest who would appreciate having interest rates at three per cent. constituents would appreciate it. Not only does Australia in relative terms have the highest or, if not that, at least very high interest rates by world standards but also we have the Treasurer saying that his definition of low interest rates is anything below 10 per cent. I find this shocking. I do not know how coalition members could readily accept that. An interest rate rise to 10 per cent would be catastrophic in my electorate. Maybe coalition electorates are very different, but an interest rate increase to 10 per cent would be catastrophic for people who are very proud to have a house that they are paying off, whether they are young families-and I have heaps of those people in my electorate-or people who bought their houses some 10 years ago. tion?

222,Mr Price,"Yes.ing interest rates in early 1990? Labor we had higher interest rates. I acknowledge that. The honourable member for Forrest is absolutely correct, but what is the point? Isn’t the point about the impact on families? Even when Labor had interest rates at 17 per cent, the percentage of family income going to pay their mortgages was a lot lower. That is the whole problem. Yes, there are lower interest rates these days, but it is a higher proportion-the mortgages are bigger. Forrest that we need to look at the impact on families. Today, in 2005, there is more money from families going to pay off mortgages than there ever was under Labor. The difference in percentage of household income then and now is quite dramatic. That is why even the smallest increase in interest rates is of greatest concern to battling families out there. I guess I would ask rhetorically: does the member for Forrest support his Treasurer when he says that anything less than 10 per cent is a low rate of interest? To be fair to him, I think not. Mr Prosser interjectingfew things that I want to raise. We all know that we have a massive skills shortage putting upwards pressure on interest rates. Not only do we have a broken promise on interest rates but we have a tremendous skills shortage. Something like 270,000 people, young and old, have been turned away from TAFEs in the last six years. If we have a skills shortage, what a tragedy that the Howard government took their eyes off the ball and turned away 270,000 people. The Skills for work report was released by the Howard government on Monday. It is one of those reports that they have actually released. It says that the growth in apprenticeships has been in areas where there are no skill shortages. So we are turning 270,000 people away from getting a qualification, but the Howard government has produced a huge surplus of those who have received qualifications where there are no shortages. Apprenticeships in my electorateand I am sure in others-are quite important. School based apprenticeships is an area in which I am taking a great deal of interest. My state does not have a very large proportion of school based apprenticeships, and in my electorate I only have 20 people who are doing school based apprenticeships. I certainly believe this is an area where we can, over time and working productively, increase the number of apprentices. I am hoping that I might do that in my electorate and I certainly hope that others might do the same in their electorates. It is a real pity when you have high unemployment, as I do in my electorate. I regret to say that I have the highest number of unemployed in the state of New South Wales. It is not something I am very proud of. Under the coalition, unemployment in Chifley has risen steadily. In the quarter to March 2004, it reached an all-time high of 10.4 per cent. Although the last two quarterly reports have shown a slight drop, the jobless rate is still far too high.

229,Mr Price,"You are quite happy for that 10 per cent interest rate impact. There were athe national average. I find it totally unacceptable that Chifley has the highest rate in New South Wales. It is a tragedy that there are some 6,649 Chifley residents who cannot get jobs. One group who face particular hardships are mature age workers-that is, people aged 55 to 64. Their participation in the work force in the electorate of Chifley is 48.4 per cent. This is below the national average of 52.8 per cent. More than half of mature age people in Chifley are not in the work force; their skills and experience are being wasted. In the 2001 election campaign John Howard promised that mature age unemployment would be on the third-term agenda; we are still waiting for action. I have alerted John Howard through a question in the House to Chifley’s high unemployment rate. The Prime Minister was quite dismissive, I regret to say, and nothing has been done. No initiatives have been taken. I would urge him to investigate the reasons behind the astronomical figure and take action accordingly. The people of my electorate are sick and tired of being taken for granted. Job Network operators in my electorate tell me there needs to be reform. In an interview with the St Mary’s Star the General Manager of the Salvation Army’s Joblink program in Sydney’s west and south-west, Greg Waldron, lamented that incentives are only paid when job seekers are placed. The incentive system encourages the networks to place easy to place job seekers, leaving those who need more intensive assistance sidelined. Waldron went on: ‘Mature people are particularly disadvantaged because they need to be unemployed for six months before they fall into a system or a stream where they can gain adequate assistance.’ In Chifley, what you have got is a lot of people who are long-term employees of government instrumentalities who have a narrow band of skills and are unable to translate those skills to the requirements of the labour market. The government has abandoned mature age workers, particularly mature age men. They have been put in the ‘too hard’ box. Patrick McClure, the Chief Executive of the second-largest network, Mission Australia, last year criticised the Job Network structure as taking a one size fits all approach which was not helping the special needs of mature age job seekers who often need intensive assistance, retraining et cetera. Figures released in June last year by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations show that mature age job seekers experience the worse employment outcomes following participation in every level of assistance delivered by the Job Network. Even after receiving the greatest level of assistance available under the Job Network, intensive assistance, more than half of mature age job seekers remain unemployed. In response to these figures, Patrick McClure argued for changes to be made to the structure, saying, ‘The more personalised service that is given, the better the outcome can be.’ Labor’s package to assist mature age workers would have invested $26.5 million over four years to set up career centres aimed at helping mature age job seekers to find work. In addition, up to 63,000 mature age workers would have been given Job Search assistance, literacy and numeracy assessment, counselling and career change advice. Youth unemployment in Chifley is another issue that needs to be addressed urgently. At 22.2 per cent, it is far too high. I want to make a few comments about the so-called ‘Cornelia Rau affair’. I think it is fairly typical of this government-in particular, of the Prime Minister-that the Prime Minister cannot even apologise for that situation. And it really highlights quite a few things that are wrong with the Howard government’s immigration policy. An Australian resident was detained for 10 months. She is a schizophrenic who ‘did not meet the criteria for mental illness’. Allegations of her treatment are chilling. How many asylum seekers have been neglected as MAIN COMMITTEE Cornelia was? How many men, women and children have failed to get adequate health care? How many lives have been permanently damaged? Both you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, and I know of the good work of the honourable member for Cook, who is a member of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that visited detention centres. I have said before and I say again: his contribution to that committee highlighted the potential psychological and psychiatric impact on people of prolonged periods of detention. But here we had someone who was already a schizophrenic, and she was not detected by the system for 10 months. Someone who is a permanent resident of Australia can end up in a detention centre undetected and untreated. Ms Burke-Shameful! government, but it reflects well on none of us. Cornelia Rau and her family could not even get a public apology. To his credit, the honourable member for Wentworth said that he thought the government should apologise, that the Prime Minister should make an apology. When you make a mistake-and we are all human, presumably-don’t you apologise? Isn’t that the proper and appropriate thing to do? any more legal complications. When will it be in the term of this Prime Minister that we will get an apology? We have not got one so far. He seems incapable of offering an apology to anyone, no matter what the circumstance. I hope we will make changes to Australia’s detention system to absolutely ensure that there will never be a repetition of that sordid affair. (Time expired) Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (10.53 a.m.)-I rise today to also talk on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005, the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2004-2005 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2004-2005, and to demonstrate how this government’s policies are indeed harming, not benefiting, the residents of my electorate, Chisholm. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the provision of health services. We have been pushed further and further into a user-pays system where the costs keep on rising and more and more of my constituents are not able to keep up. According to the Australian Health Insurance Association, 60.4 per cent of my electorate is covered by private health insurance. This is nearly 20 percentage points higher than the 43 per cent national average quoted by the AHIA. Consequently, a huge chunk of my electorate will be adversely affected by the latest rise in health insurance premiums-the fourth consecutive premium increase for private health funds. The average eight per cent increase in premiums approved by the Minister for Health and Ageing last week will cost a family with hospital and auxiliary cover on average an extra $164 per year. They cannot afford this. More importantly, the people in my electorate who continue to maintain their private health insurance are usually self-funded retirees and pensioners, and they do not have any discretionary income with which to pick up this excess cost. Many of them are looking down the barrel of keeping their private health insurance or having to forgo it. This is just ridiculous.

232,Mr Price,"It did not diminish the Queensland Premier to apologise. It has not causedAt the same time that premiums are going up, people who actually use their health insurance are hit with rising out-of-pocket costs. The Australian Private Hospitals Association estimated in February that out-of-pocket costs for patients in a private hospital not approved by Medibank Private will increase by up to $400 a day under their new competitive selection process. I was stunned to read in the papers recently that the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, had only discovered that there was an out-of-pocket experience in respect of private health because he had recently had an operation. Doesn’t he listen to his constituency? Doesn’t he know about his own portfolio? It is absurd that he did not realise there was an outof-pocket component when you use your own private health insurance. I have full private health cover; I always have had. I do not have a psychological or principled problem with it, as we on the Labor side are continually accused of having. With my first baby, I was $1,000 out of pocket. With my second one, it went up to $1,500 out of pocket on top of my full private health insurance. I cannot believe that the Minister for Health and Ageing had no idea that that is how the system works, that you get these bills and you get these bills and you get these bills. It is obscene that he does not know how his own system works and how his own system is impacting on everyday Australians. The government just sits on its hands not wanting to get its hands dirty by actually forcing the private health companies to show how they are providing value for money. I put a series of questions on notice in the last parliament asking what control measures are actually put in place when you grant premium increases. Do you actually ask that the private insurers demonstrate that you are getting value for money through their products? Do you actually demonstrate that they are keeping down out-of-pocket expenses? No, there is no quality control on these rises. There is no actual assessment that what we are paying for is good policy, that we are getting a decent return for allowing these increases. Bearing in mind that the 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance is recurrent, we are paying for these insurance companies-these companies that were technically set up originally as not for profit, friendly societies which were not meant to make profits but which are making huge profits nowadays-time and time again and we do not regulate in any way the service or the provisions of the product they provide. Let us remember the Prime Minister’s infamous words of 2001 when he promised his policies on private health insurance would ‘lead to reduced premiums over time’. Instead, the Prime Minister has presided over a 21 per cent increase in premiums over the three years. The previous member for Chisholm, the Hon. Dr Wooldridge, the Minister for Health and Aged Care at the time the 30 per cent rebate came in, said that premiums would not go up, that premiums in fact would come down. But, over the life of this policy, premiums have gone up 21 per cent and people are actually paying more out-of-pocket expenses. It is not a good product and we are not ensuring that it is a good product. The government’s intention is also to attack Medicare. I love the minister for health now saying that they are the friends of Medicare! What a laugh. What a joke. Medicare is rightly held up as a world-class public health system. The government’s current policy has wrought damage in Chisholm. Our local bulk-billing rate is stuck in a rut despite the government spending $4 million on quick fix bandaids in the lead-up to the last election. The government’s own figures released in February revealed that the rate of GP attendances by local MAIN COMMITTEE residents in 2004 that were bulk-billed was 72.4 per cent compared to 72.3 per cent in 2003. A percentage rise of 0.1 per cent is pathetic. The rate of bulk-billing is actually fairly high in Chisholm compared to other seats. I have a particularly ageing population that need to rely upon their GPs and they need to be able to rely on bulk-billing GPs. A 0.1 per cent rise does not go anywhere towards making up the ground lost in my electorate where the bulk-billing rate has fallen by more than 10 per cent over the last four years. We had a really healthy bulk-billing rate of 83 per cent back in 2000, but the government’s user-pays approach to health services has put paid to that. Local residents who miss out on getting bulk-billed face rising out-of-pocket costs. Costs have gone up by 60.5 per cent since 1966 from $8.89 to $14.27, and this is at a time when the government spent more than $20 million last year alone on Medicare related advertising. How much more beneficial would it have been for the government to direct its efforts towards coming up with real and long-term solutions to get the bulk-billing rate in Chisholm and elsewhere back up to at least 80 per cent? While I am speaking about health services in my electorate, it would be remiss of me not to mention the government’s long overdue decision to grant a Medicare licence to the MRI unit based at Box Hill Hospital. I actually want to say thankyou to the government for finally listening to the pleas of my residents. For years residents of Melbourne’s entire eastern region, encompassing the municipalities of Whitehorse, Knox, Maroondah, Manningham and Yarra Ranges-this is an enormous area with an enormous population-have not had access to a bulk-billing MRI machine within their region. Yes, we have had an MRI machine, but you could not be bulk-billed at it. The last thing anybody needs when they are referred for an MRI test is the stress of having to work out how they would afford it or having to travel kilometres to access a bulk-billing machine. I, in conjunction with the Labor candidate for Deakin, brought this matter to the attention of the minister in a letter early last year, and I was pleased that Labor announced during last year’s election campaign that in government we would provide a Medicare licence for the MRI machine at Box Hill Hospital. The government’s decision is better late than never, and I am relieved that residents will finally be able to have an MRI test locally without having to pay hundreds of dollars for it. I would also like to thank the member for Deakin, who has not played politics with this by ensuring that the MRI actually goes into his seat but has seen fit to say that the most logical place in our neck of the woods for a bulk-billing MRI machine is at Box Hill Hospital, where we have a hub of medical services that all people in the eastern region actually access. That was the only announcement that the Liberal candidate running against me in the last election made during the campaign, so there was finally realisation after years and years of neglect that we needed better services for the east of Melbourne. This government’s user-pays approach is of course not restricted to health services. We have already witnessed this year its devastating impact on higher education. Figures released last month by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee confirmed what we were saying loudly and clearly throughout the campaign. The AVCC data revealed a five per cent drop in applications across Australia for 2005 university courses. That is a decline of 12,123 applicants. In my electorate, both Monash and Deakin universities have raised their fees by 25 per cent this year. For example, Monash’s decision means that HECS paid on an arts or science degree has risen from $3,854 to $4,818 per year and for a law or medical degree has shot up MAIN COMMITTEE by $6,427 to $8,033 per year. Young people have voted with their feet on the government’s 25 per cent hike in HECS fees, and our country will be much poorer for it. While we are talking about a skills shortage, I would say we are right to be concentrating on apprentices. I condemn the Minister for Education, Science and Training for saying that people on the Labor side have not been talking about it. I have been talking about it for years. I reject this notion of new apprenticeships. They are traineeships; they are not apprenticeships. They are not genuine apprenticeships in a skilled trade area. They are not actually producing motor mechanics, electricians, plumbers and all those people that we need so desperately. You try getting a tradesman in to fix something in your house; it is virtually impossible. We also have a skills shortage in areas of higher education. We have a chronic shortage of dentists in our community. We have an absolute dearth of dentists within our community. We have recently seen in my electorate the opening of 10 dental chairs in the Whitehorse Community Health Centre supplied by the state government. Commonwealth funding towards this wonderful initiative has been nowhere to be seen. Ten dental chairs-this is fantastic. We had a waiting list for dental services that had blown out to four years-four years to see a dentist! I hope we are now going to be able to get that down within the next 12 months to a six-month waiting period and then to actually reduce it over time. Some of the chairs will be used to train dental students, because we do not have enough chairs for training dental students. The thing is that we do not actually have enough dental students. If we keep raising HECS fees and locking people out of going to university, we are not going to have enough dentists and we certainly are not going to have enough nurses. There is a crisis in nursing at the moment. Go to any aged care facility and the people there will tell you that their biggest problem is getting qualified, accredited staff who have actually trained in aged care nursing. So it is all well and good to be doing these things and saying, ‘We’re actually putting more money into universities,’ but it is via students’ pockets and they are voting with their feet and not taking up these places. Speaking of education and training, my electorate is home to one of the best recognised TAFEs, the Box Hill Institute of TAFE. At a time of chronic skills shortages, Box Hill Institute is educating about 33,000 people every year and 88 per cent of Box Hill Institute graduates gain employment within 12 months. Given that kind of record, I cannot understand why the government is hell-bent on establishing a handful of new technical colleges across the country. These technical colleges will not even open until next year and will not be fully functional until 2008. Instead of wasting millions of dollars and duplicating existing TAFEs, would it not be smarter to use the funds to create 45,000 new TAFE places immediately? Give the money to the TAFEs now. They are there now; they are working now. Why duplicate them? It is just ridiculous. Box Hill TAFE is a premier institute. I had the pleasure of taking Peter Garrett through the facility prior to the election and it was fascinating to see skilled tradeskids standing around, really proud to show off their ability to produce things. This is a great institution. It also does great work back in our community. Box Hill TAFE students and also Holmesglen TAFE students are often used on projects for community services. They have built a number of residential houses within the area that are being used by mothers with postnatal depression and by homeless youths. The students get real life experience, going out and building homes, as opposed to just doing things within the college enviMAIN COMMITTEE ronment. We already have this great experience and great service. We should fund them appropriately. Not only is this government not investing in the future of our young people but it is not investing in infrastructure. The just-released Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report Economic policy reforms: going for growth again confirms that under the Howard government’s watch public investment in Australia’s national infrastructure has been run down. The report highlights that since 1997 public sector investment, including in infrastructure, slumped to around 2.2 per cent of GDP, the sixth lowest of all OECD countries. That compares with the previous period of 1990 to 1996 which recorded a level of about 2.6 per cent of GDP. In my neck of the woods, this underinvestment means that we have gone without a necessary piece of public transport infrastructure. Just this week, I lodged a petition signed by 750 people, collected on just one day, by staff and students of Monash University and users of the Monash precinct, calling for action to establish the Rowville rail link via Melbourne. The petition reads: For too long we have been waiting for decent public transport access linking Monash and the south-east to the rest of Melbourne. Federal Labor went to the 2001 federal election with a commitment, in partnership with the Bracks state government, to construct a new light rail link along North and Wellington roads from Huntingdale station to Monash University. The cost was estimated to be about $60 million and it would have been the first stage of a light rail connection to Rowville. The link would have given residents living around North Road improved access to other south-eastern suburbs such as Clayton and Oakleigh. The federal government has had more than three years to match Labor’s commitment and it has just sat on its hands. There was absolutely no announcement by the candidate running against me in the last election, except maybe for the MRI-and he was a bit vague on that. Money was splashed around in a lot of other electorates, but the government did not say that they would commit anything to Chisholm. I took that as a bit of a compliment. It also ignored the fact that the people in my neck of the woods do need infrastructure developments and are not getting them. They keep talking about a rather large road, but they did not talk about public transport, which is actually more vital in my neck of the woods. Having been a student at Monash, I know how near impossible it is to get out to Monash University by public transport. The notion of the train stopping a good 20 or 30 kilometres from the university’s front door is just ridiculous and needs to be fixed. Residents have to continue to wait for bus services. I have stood there waiting for those buses. You can wait while four buses go by before you can actually get onto one because there are so many people, students and staff, particularly during peak hour, trying to get to Monash University. The light rail to Rowville would also have taken passengers to the hub area around Monash medical centre at the shopping precinct at Clayton. Students travelling to Monash-now a world-class institution which has a huge proportion of overseas students who access public transport-have to continue to put up with substandard public transport access. The federal government has failed to invest in the Australian synchrotron just outside my electorate in the adjoining electorate of Bruce. More than 70 synchrotrons have been built worldwide, mainly in the US, Britain and Japan, with Canada, Brazil, Singapore and other small countries either having them in operation or building them now. But this federal govMAIN COMMITTEE ernment just does not have the vision to support this initiative. It prefers for our scientists to continue having to go overseas to carry out research at other synchrotrons. It prefers Australian companies and universities to continue having to pay large sums to send researchers overseas. It prefers to forgo the income we can expect to receive from the influx of foreign researchers coming to the Australian synchrotron. The Victorian state government needs to be commended for its vision in saying: ‘Yes, we’re going to build the synchrotron. We need one in Australia. We’ve needed one for a long time.’ One of the local area consultative committees in my neck of the woods has now put in four applications for a regional partnership to go to the synchrotron, which is going to be a pre-eminent world building. It is going to bring scientists and businesses from all over our region into our country. It is projected growth. But has the ACC in my neck of the woods been able to get funding for this? No. There has been not one iota, not one bit of interest from the federal government to invest in this project. At my last meeting with the people from the ACC, I said, ‘Do you think it has something to do with the fact that you are around three safe Labor seats?’ They smiled wryly at me but would not enter into discussions on this. I think it has something to do with it. As opposed to actually investing in this bit of infrastructure that is going to bring so much benefit to our society and our country, the government are snubbing their noses at it, and that will be sadder for us all. The government’s short-sightedness can also be seen in their failure to address the crisis in housing affordability in this country. The great Australian dream is now a nightmare for many. Most young people will never be able to afford their own home, and certainly many young people in my electorate will be priced out of affording a home in the suburb in which they grew up, where they feel comfortable and where they have existing community networks. During the last decade, the proportion of first home buyers fell by about 30 per cent. Average monthly repayments on new loans have increased by about 50 per cent and 30 to 50 per cent of our wages is going on home loan repayments. According to the Reserve Bank, 60 per cent of the population have paid down their loan or have a mortgage. That leaves 40 per cent out in the cold. Where is the government’s plan to make housing affordable, to curb spiralling credit card debt and the overexposure to home loans? The Tenants Union of Victoria knows what a struggle the lack of affordable housing is for thousands of Victorians. The union provides assistance to almost 30,000 tenants annually, in both private and social housing systems, who are suffering because of unaffordable or inappropriate housing. It assists many people for whom housing related poverty is a reality. Many are paying huge percentages of their limited income just to put a roof over their heads. Last year the Tenants Union of Victoria released an affordability bulletin which highlighted the extreme difficulties that those on social security benefits have in finding affordable housing and how inadequate Commonwealth rental assistance is. A national summit on housing affordability was held in Canberra last June, bringing together the Housing Industry Association of Australia, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Local Government Association and the National Housing Alliance. Among the calls to action resulting from the summit was the following key objective: The crucial economic, social and environmental significance of housing to Australia and its people requires a substantial strengthening of national leadership and cooperation in the field and in the related areas of urban and regional development. The Commonwealth Government should play a wide-ranging MAIN COMMITTEE and vigorous role in developing this approach, as do its federal counterparts in Canada and the United States. We need to be doing more about affordable housing. We can talk about low interest rates all we like, but that does not mean you can actually afford a house, and it has actually made houses more unaffordable. It is just ridiculous to keep saying, ‘Oh, well, housing prices are going up,’ and you have this great equity. Many people are never going to realise that equity. You want to have housing at an affordable rate so that people can actually buy in and can get their own homes. This government stands condemned for its inaction in this area. (Time expired) Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (11.13 a.m.)-The speakers list for this debate today says a lot about the government’s attitude to economic management. When things are going well, members of the government are lining up to claim credit and to pat themselves on the back for their brilliant management of the economy. But where are they today, a week after the interest rate rise, the worse current account deficit figure on record and the news that the economy has effectively stalled, with next to no growth in GDP in the last quarter? There is not a single government member on the speakers list to explain what the government has been doing while foreign debt has climbed, household debt is squeezing families to breaking point and the shortage of skilled tradespeople and technicians is threatening our economic growth and export performance, putting pressure on interest rates. The government are happy to claim credit for economic results when it suits them, even when they have to steal credit from their predecessors, the Hawke and Keating governments, who did the hard reform work of restructuring our economy in the 1980s and 1990s. They will never take any responsibility when, as is happening now, the results of their own negligence and complacency are becoming impossible to ignore and demand answers more sophisticated than simply blaming the state governments and throwing taxpayers’ money around. The gloomy economic figures released last week have finally called this government to account for its ‘she’ll be right, mate’ attitude to the management of Australia’s economy. But the warning signs about the key trouble spots have been around for a long time. The government has simply been too arrogant to listen and too lazy to take any action. The area that I want to talk about today is that of the skills shortage, because it is the failure of this government to invest in training that is having the greatest impact on the people and industries of Central Queensland. As you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, Capricornia’s backyard is home to the booming black coal industry, and you do not have to look very hard out in the mining towns to find a story about the crunch that the shortage of skilled tradespeople and technicians is putting on that sector and its associated industries. It is also a classic illustration of how skills shortages lead to wage pressures and inflation more generally. I was out in Blackwater visiting with the Duaringa Shire Council the week before the Reserve Bank increased interest rates. The council told me the story of something that is happening there right now. BMA-BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance-want to build a wash plant at one of their coal operations, so they have set about building single persons quarters to house the construction crew that they would need to build that plant. They were told that there were no electricians available to connect power to the single persons quarters, so they are going to have to operate these quarters on diesel generators for at least 20 weeks while they wait for electricity to be connected. The use of those generators is going to add $350,000 to the cost of MAIN COMMITTEE the project. So there is the skills shortage sending $350,000 straight onto the bottom line of that project, which is so important to our coal export industry. As the mayor told me that story I had an image of these costs cascading through our local economy and creating the kind of inflation that the Reserve Bank has been warning us about for some time now. Clearly, that cascade made it all the way to the Reserve Bank by last Wednesday, when the bank raised interest rates and effectively told the government to wake up to itself and its responsibilities for maintaining strong growth, strong exports and the skilled work force that it inherited from the previous Labor government. To me, the current skills shortage is the most shameful aspect of the government’s failures as an economic manager. I say that because of its effect on interest rates, which eat into the living standards of every family and homeowner in Australia, and also because it represents such a lost opportunity for the thousands of people who want to improve their skills, who want to work and who want to secure their futures. How many Australians have missed out on opportunities for training and employment in the trade areas that are now filling up the ‘positions vacant’ columns right around Australia? I am particularly angry about this because of the opportunities that have gone begging for unemployed people in my electorate-opportunities that would have been there if this government were fair dinkum about the future of regional areas like Central Queensland. The stresses, tensions and challenges in regional and rural Australia are not new in a historical sense or unique to Australia. There is an underlying set of forces that influence the relationship between the capital cities and the other areas of our economy. What is occurring now is a strengthening of factors adverse to the regional economies and associated with a greater reliance on market forces in determining the structure of the economy. This is a period when, relatively speaking, transport and communication costs have been falling rapidly. Because businesses do not pay the full resource cost of operating in cities, there is a tilting of the economic playing field in favour of the capital cities. In the past, before this government’s term, some of the disadvantages to rural areas were compensated for by assistance to rural areas. A measure of the success of these pre-Howard measures can be seen in the difference between the unemployment rates of the six major capital cities and rural and regional Australia. Prior to this government the differential between unemployment in rural and regional Australia and the capital cities was consistently between one-quarter and one-half of one per cent. By 1997 this difference leapt to an unacceptable 1½ per cent and has been held there by the policies of this government ever since. The outcome of these conditions make it imperative that government programs which seek to allow regional areas to maintain their share of the returns from growth and the location of economic activity must involve government intervention in the marketplace more effectively than happens now. It is true that the Howard government have done this to some extent: they have instituted government programs to assist regional Australia. But I would say that these programs have failed. In recent weeks we have heard much in the House and seen much in the media about this government’s rorted Regional Partnerships program, where government money has been directed into projects not for sound economic reasons but for base political objectives. It is not my intention today to go back over the now infamous A2 milk scandal or the collapsed Beaudesert Rail debacle, but these are just a couple of examples of how this government have misdirected much-needed funds-funds which, if strategically directed, could have had a lastMAIN COMMITTEE ing and positive effect on the people of regional and rural Australia; funds which, if properly directed, could have created real jobs in regional Australia and provided training for those jobs. A good example of this government missing an opportunity to support regional Australia was their failure to provide assistance for the development of a meat industry training facility in Rockhampton. In 1999, the local regional development organisation came up with a proposal to establish a trainee meat processing facility. I supported this proposal with correspondence to the Deputy Prime Minister. As you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, the meat industry is Australia’s fourth largest export industry and is therefore significant in its impact on the Australian economy, Australia’s rural sector and those communities such as Rockhampton which are affected by the industry’s financial viability. Rockhampton is home to two large meat processing facilities and it was obvious at the time to the proponents of the scheme that inherent to the survival and growth of the industry was the ongoing need for additional competent labour. Back in 1999 it was obvious to the local industry that they were looking down the barrel of a serious skills shortage. A very detailed proposal was put together by the local industry and the local development organisation. This proposal was to construct a dedicated facility for the ongoing formal training and assessment of trainee slaughter-persons, boners, slicers and packers. This would ensure a future skilled work force was available for the local industry and it would ensure this work force was drawn predominantly from the local community. In January 2000, a deputation was made to the Deputy Prime Minister by the proponents of this project. The Deputy Prime Minister indicated his support for the project but nothing further happened. In February 2000, the proponents of the project travelled to Hervey Bay for a meeting with the then Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, the Hon. Peter Reith, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. Warren Truss. Again the proponents of this skills development project were given words of encouragement by the Howard government ministers at this meeting. The Australian Labor Party committed itself to the project during the 2001 election campaign. But the Howard government did nothing. Submission after submission was sent to the office of the Deputy Prime Minister. I wrote and lobbied. The proponents of the proposal met again with the Deputy Prime Minister. There was constant communication with and support for the project from the Central Queensland area consultative committee and the project was listed at the Northern Australia Forum, hosted by Senator Ian Macdonald in October 2000. Still the Howard government did nothing to provide this much-needed skills training for the meat industry. What has been the consequence of the Howard government’s failure to provide skills training to the meat industry? In 2004, Central Queensland meat processors started to import skilled labourers from Brazil. The Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee was advised during Senate estimates just a few weeks ago that, up until September 2004, 16 visas had been issued to workers from Brazil to come to Rockhampton and work in the meat processing industry. My information is that a further 30 are on their way. The government cannot say that this problem was not foreseen. The government cannot say that it did not know about this problem. The government did know. The Deputy Prime Minister certainly knew about the problem, but the Howard government chose to do nothing about it. The Howard government chose not to develop a local skills base to ensure the employment for local MAIN COMMITTEE young people. The Howard government is clearly comfortable with the growing disparity in the unemployment rates between the capital cities of Australia and regional Australia. I am not happy with this ongoing neglect of regional Australia and nor are the people of Rockhampton in particular. Here we have jobs in our local meat works going to imported Brazilian labourers because this government failed to make the necessary investment in our local Australian work force. So there are men and women walking the streets of Rockhampton without a job, willing to be trained and willing to work in the meat processing industry but watching local jobs going to imported labour. Does the Howard government know or care or take any responsibility for these people? Clearly not, when its only answer to the skills shortage is to import overseas labour. I note that during the Senate estimates hearing on 15 February Senator Kirk asked: From what you have told me, in the case of Rockhampton there would not have been any independent assessment done as to whether or not there was in fact a skills shortage in the area-in other words, whether or not there were local employees available. In response, Mr Rizvi from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs said: We did not undertake labour market testing as that is not part of this particular visa. That is always the response from this government: take no responsibility, and take the easy way out. Instead of looking at what could be done to create opportunities in a place like Rockhampton, just import workers from overseas-another lazy, short-term response to the challenges faced by regional Australia. From this example, you can see that this is not a government for all Australians. It is certainly not a government for the people of Rockhampton or any other part of regional Australia. Here we have the ultimate economic double whammy against the unemployed workers of Central Queensland. First, the government are advised there is a skills shortage coming, five years before it happens. They do nothing about it. Then, when it does happen, they do not bother to try to come in and help the local unemployed people obtain the skills needed; they simply import the labour from Brazil. Every social commentator will tell you that, behind riots or trouble in places like Redfern, Macquarie Fields or even Palm Island, there is an element of unemployment that feeds into the discontent of those communities. In Central Queensland there are pockets of severe unemployment in places like Mount Morgan, Woorabinda and parts of Rockhampton. These people want to work, the jobs are there and they need the skills to make the most of those opportunities. The Howard government have failed these people. I believe that any Australian government worthy of the name has a moral responsibility to ensure the people of this country are skilled and ready to take advantage of any opportunity which comes our way. In this, by any measure, you would have to say that the Howard government have failed. In the time. I have left, I want to shift to the issue of the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program, which is also a big issue in my local electorate. The dream of home ownership is a very strong part of the Australian mind-set, so it is quite understandable that, in any discussion of our economic outlook, there is a large focus on interest rates and the impact that any rise in interest rates is going to have on home buyers and those people who have that dream of owning their own home. But for many Australians that dream will never be a reality and in fact their living situation is much closer to a nightmare than a dream. I am talking MAIN COMMITTEE about the 100,000 men, women and children who are homeless in Australia. While the government’s complacency and irresponsibility are putting pressure on home buyers, its neglect and disinterest are causing hardship to those who are most vulnerable in our community-that is, the homeless. The federal government is currently in negotiation with the states over the next round of the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program. That agreement will provide the basis of funding for the next five years for the 1,200 or so organisations that provide assistance to those who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. The government’s offer to the states to kick off negotiations was made in December last year, and it is hopelessly inadequate for the demand that is out there for services for homeless people and people at risk of homelessness. The offer made by the federal government only really provides for indexation of two per cent over the next five years and also carves out of the funding $106 million for a special innovations pool. This is at a time when the government’s own review of the SAAP last year indicated that it requires a 15 per cent increase in funding just to meet the existing demand. This is no time for the government to be carving money out of the funds needed to meet the core services, and it is certainly no time to be slashing or capping funding for these important services that provide assistance to homeless people in our community. As I said, the government’s own review showed that SAAP needs a 15 per cent increase in funding just to meet the current demand. The data collected last year from SAAP funded organisations showed that 67,000 requests for assistance were unmet by services last year. The services are stretched to absolute capacity. That is no surprise. The government is offering two per cent indexation over the next five years, but look what has happened to the costs in the services over the last few years. I talked to the president of one of the local services, Capricorn Youth Accommodation Service, in my area yesterday. I am on the management committee of that service, so I am quite close to the issues facing services, like the Capricorn Youth Accommodation Service in this instance, that are trying to provide shelter for homeless young people. First, the cash award which covers employees in the sector had a three per cent increase effective from February this year, so there is a three per cent increase in wages for employees who help homeless people. Also, insurance costs have gone through the roof, not just for public liability insurance but also for insurance of properties. Because of the increase in house prices over the last few years that this government is so proud of, the cost for insurance has gone up correspondingly because the services have to insure for the replacement value of the properties under their management. Telstra line rentals have gone up by much more than the CPI. So the costs of running the services are much higher than two per cent indexation is ever going to cover. Also, the complexity of the problems of the clients who come to seek help from these services has increased greatly. The services are seeing many more people with multiple sources of disadvantage and, in particular, are seeing a lot of clients who are not having their needs met through the mental health system and therefore are accessing services for homelessness. So the complexity of the client mix is growing. This all adds up to the government’s own assessment in its review last year that a 15 per cent increase in funding is required just to meet the current demand. MAIN COMMITTEE As I said, the money put up by the federal government is not good enough, in any assessment. We also have great problems in the Labor Party and within the sector with the minister’s proposal to carve out $106 million for pilot projects in its innovation pool. There is no detail about what the innovation pool is actually seeking to address. From my experience, many of these government pilot projects go nowhere. They are funded for a year or two and then fall off the edge of the cliff, never to be seen again. That is not good enough at a time when, as I said, 100,000 men, women and children in Australia are homeless and the services that are right there trying to help them, day in and day out, are not properly funded. It is not good enough for the government to play the blame game with the states when we are talking about the people who are most vulnerable in our community. The government’s old line about the GST windfall for the states is not going to work any more. I read in the Financial Review just before I came in here today that the federal government has its own GST windfall, so let us not hear any more of this ‘Flick it all to the states and let them pay for it.’ The fact is the federal government is responsible for looking after the most vulnerable in our community. It has to do the right thing in the meeting on Friday when it comes to providing proper funding for the SAAP program. (Time expired) Ms KING (Ballarat) (11.33 a.m.)-In this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20042005, the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2004-2005 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2004-2005 I want to focus on the Howard government’s economic performance and their failure to address key economic issues in relation to skills shortages and infrastructure. The Howard government have lacked any real vision when it comes to reforming the economy. The lack of vision and complacency of the government are starting to be revealed in the Australian economy. Last week we had a trifecta of economic failure from the government. Interest rates rose, despite the claim by the Howard government during the election that we would have downward pressure on interest rates if they were re-elected. Private health insurance premiums went up by eight per cent after the Prime Minister promised downward pressure on premiums and that private health insurance would be more affordable and attractive to consumers. And economic growth is now at a virtual standstill, with the economy only growing, in the latest figures, by 0.1 per cent. Much of the growth in the economy has been driven by consumer spending and high levels of debt. Frankly, as the latest growth figures show, it was not sustainable. The latest retail figures show that households are reining in their spending because many families have reached their limit of spending and are trying to consolidate their budgets. The latest financial accounts reveal that household debt in Australia stands at a record $808 billion, and debt as a proportion of household income continues to rise. In fact, for many families now, their debts are higher than their incomes. As a percentage of disposable household income, household debt is now a record 154.7 per cent, up from 85.5 per cent in March 1996. Household debt in Australia is amongst the highest in the developed world, which means that even the small increase we have seen in interest rates has created financial problems for many families. In my own electorate it has, on average, meant that families have to find an extra $32 a month to meet their mortgage repayments. This week the news did not get any better. The Skills at work report confirmed that, while the Howard government is spending $66 billion, it has in its nine years in office failed to avoid-and in fact has helped to contribute to-the skills crisis. We are not even providing MAIN COMMITTEE sufficient TAFE places and New Apprenticeships for plumbers, carpenters, builders and electricians to cover today’s shortages, let alone for those of tomorrow. The Skills at Work report shows the number of people completing their apprenticeship in trades like carpentry and plumbing has fallen. The problem has been hidden by the government’s claim that it has increased New Apprenticeships. You have to watch the words here. ‘New Apprenticeships’, it calls them. But what the government fails to disclose is that in combining traditional trade apprenticeships with traineeships-predominantly in retail, I have to say-under the banner of New Apprenticeships it is actually hiding what has happened to trade apprenticeships. The Skills at Work report shows that between 2000 and 2003 the number of people starting a traditional trade apprenticeship fell by more than 2000. It recommends that the government investigates how it can boost the number of employers taking part in the program in areas where there are national skills shortages. The Howard government, again in an attempt to shift blame, says that it is the states and territories that have been cutting their spending on training. Frankly, that is simply not true. Since 1997 the Howard government has miserably trailed the states and territories in their investment in vocational education and training. The National Centre for Vocational Education Research reports that over this period the Howard government has increased funding by less than 10 per cent, compared with an increase of 17.8 per cent from the states and territories. The government has failed to foresee the nation’s employment needs. We have had far too many young people going into areas where we do not have skills shortages rather than into those areas where there are very serious skills shortages. Extra cash incentives for hiring apprentices and more TAFE places are needed to fix Australia’s shortage of skilled tradespeople, according to employers. Calls for action came as new data showed a boom in apprenticeship numbers, but with most of the growth in industries where there are no skills shortages. Sectors in desperate need, such as plumbing and carpentry, where skilled labour shortages have sent costs soaring, hired 2,000 fewer apprentices in the three years to 2003, according to the Skills at Work report. It says: ‘We need to focus on the incentives regime. Regional incentives should be extended to city areas with similar shortages. Higher incentives should be paid to people who take on more skill-rich apprenticeships.’ In my electorate, the Master Bricklayers Association has been established and bricklayers have done something which is quite amazing but which, in itself, is creating problems. The bricklaying industry in Victoria have introduced a brick levy, which has to go through the group training companies, to provide for training and extra cash for apprenticeships. That is what they have had to do in their absolute desperation to try to get more apprentices into bricklaying. They have put a $1 levy on every brick laid in both the domestic and the commercial sector, a levy which is driving up the cost of housing and creating its own pressure on new home owners in particular. That is what the Master Bricklayers Association and the building industry have had to do to try to address this problem because the government has totally failed to do anything. What the government has allowed to happen is that an association, desperate to get apprentices, has found a solution which has increased the cost of housing, particularly to new home owners. The Howard government is continuing to hurt Australian businesses and regional areas, with skilled vacancies rising over the past year in several key sectors. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations skilled vacancies index reveals the particular difficulties MAIN COMMITTEE facing businesses in regional Victoria. Regional Victoria has even higher numbers of professions and industries experiencing a skills shortage than metropolitan areas. They include, in the professions, social workers, especially in specialist areas such as aged care and trauma counselling; lawyers-I never would have thought I would be saying that we need more lawyers-especially in the areas of workplace relations, funds management and property and finance; and occupational therapists and dentists. The shortages are particularly acute in rural practice. The skills vacancies index also reveals that the Howard government still has not addressed the skills shortages for regional carpenters, joiners, fibrous plasterers, bricklayers and solid plasterers. These latest figures are particularly concerning as they come on the back of rising teenage unemployment rates in regional Victoria. Each year the Howard government is turning away from TAFE and universities thousands of qualified Australians when many of our businesses need skilled workers. The latest regional unemployment figures are disturbing news for young people in regional Victoria. The gap between the teenage unemployment rates in regional Victoria and those in inner city Melbourne is widening. Four out of five regional districts in Victoria are suffering from increases in teenage unemployment. In my electorate, a young person named Shannon, a teenager from Bacchus Marsh, knows what the high unemployment figure means for him. He is struggling to find work despite passing his VCE exams and attending interviews for pre-apprenticeship courses. He wants to be an electrician. The Howard government’s failure to fund additional TAFE places means that Shannon cannot start his preapprenticeship training until June. He has had to go onto newstart and look for work, like many thousands of teenage people who want to get access to apprenticeships but cannot get into TAFE programs to allow that to happen. So he is now one of the teenage unemployed statistics who should be able to start his electrician apprenticeship immediately. In the last six years alone, 270,000 people have been turned away from TAFE. Opportunities for younger Australians are not being created despite the well-known skills shortages in regional Victoria. My electorate of Ballarat is in the worse affected region. The Barwon West district recorded a teenage unemployment rate of 35.4 per cent, compared to just 4.8 per cent in inner Melbourne. Such a divide is not acceptable or even excusable. It is not just the level of teenage unemployment that is concerning but the speed at which it is increasing. In the Barwon West district, we have seen a 10 per cent increase in the space of only a few months. Regional labour markets are suffering a skills shortage, yet we have a large number of teenagers seeking apprenticeships who are unable to get into TAFE courses. It is clear that the Howard government’s policies are not doing the job. The Howard government is not performing in regional Australia. It needs to stop believing its own publicity and give regional Australia long-term policy solutions to its skills shortage and high teenage unemployment rates. In Victoria, there were 86,600 vacancies on Australian Job Search in mid-February 2005. The top four occupational groups were labourers, factory and machine workers; food, hospitality and tourism; gardening, farming and fishing; and sales assistants and storepersons. Over the month, 10 occupational groups rose. The largest increases were for medical science professionals, printing trades, building and engineering professionals and organisation and information professionals. The Skills for work report clearly shows that most of the growth, and certainly the largest increases in new apprenticeships, is in areas where there are no skills shortages and that the share of traditional trades new apprenticeships has MAIN COMMITTEE halved since 1996. Is it not a fact that, between 2000 and 2003, trade apprenticeships declined by 2,300 while sales and service apprenticeships and traineeships, or so-called new apprenticeships, rose during that period? The skills crisis is not sustainable, and the Howard government cannot continue to take no responsibility for the skills crisis it has created. I want to turn now to infrastructure. The OECD report Economic policy reforms: going for growth again highlights serious concerns in the way the government is handling the economy. Under the Howard-Costello government, public investment in Australia’s national infrastructure has been run down. The report highlights that since 1997 public sector investment, including in infrastructure, has slumped to around 2.2 per cent of GDP, the sixth lowest of all OECD countries. Roads are vital to our communities and to our economy. Coming from the regional electorate of Ballarat, I know how important it is for regional economies and communities to have a comprehensive national infrastructure network. The adequacy of roads, in particular, has a direct impact on the well-being and wealth of our regions and our nation. I would like to once again highlight in this place the Western Highway as an example of why it is so important to address the matter of infrastructure bottlenecks. The Western Highway runs right through the heart of my electorate. It is the principal road link between Melbourne and Adelaide. It is a national highway, and it is the lifeblood of the state. Each day it carries more than 40,000 vehicles between Melbourne and Ballarat and up to 4,000 vehicles between Ballarat and the South Australian border. The highway connects regional centres and plays a key role in linking more remote communities to regional hubs. In terms of freight, the Western Highway is the second busiest national highway in Australia, second only to the Hume. With over five million tonnes of interstate freight movement annually, it carries around 4,000 commercial vehicles per day between Ballarat and Melbourne alone, and another 1,000 vehicles per day between Ballarat and the South Australian border. Commuters and businesses in my electorate have been waiting for years for the Howard government to commit to fully funding the $294 million required for the construction of the Deer Park bypass. Because of the political nature of the Howard government’s infrastructure funding, we now have-and I would like to use the words of David Cummings, from the RACV-a project that has been given to us too little, and with a start time of 2007-2008, too late. The government’s failure to fund the Deer Park bypass is rooted in a systematic failure of government policy. Unfortunately, this failure has a follow-on effect which has wider economic implications. The Reserve Bank of Australia has cited ongoing skills shortages and acute capacity problems in the country’s national infrastructure as the two key reasons behind the rate rises. This pressure is likely to build unless the government addresses both the skills crisis and infrastructure bottlenecks such as the Deer Park bypass. Economic growth in Australia has come to a virtual standstill. The Australian economy will not grow to its full potential unless we get our infrastructure right. We need an infrastructure policy that is based on objective decisions, national interest decisions and national priority decisions. When you scrutinise the Howard government’s record on road funding, there is little surprise that there are bottlenecks in our national infrastructure network. AusLink, the Howard government’s long-term strategic approach to the nation’s infrastructure, has not helped the businesses and commuters in my electorate, nor addressed the national infrastructure bottlenecks. AusLink does not offer a cooperative approach to transport infrastructure funding. It is MAIN COMMITTEE buck-passing on a grand scale. Instead of involving the states in the drafting of AusLink, the Howard government largely ignored them. AusLink does not draw clear lines of responsibility between the Commonwealth and state governments and, as we have seen with skill shortages, the Howard government is all too willing to use smoke and mirrors to blame the state governments for its policy failures. The great shame about what the Howard government is doing is that it is squandering the economic growth of the last 20 years and has eroded the foundations on which it was built. Both in terms of the skills crisis and of infrastructure the Howard government is failing the Australian economy. I want to endorse the comments by the member for Capricornia on the SAAP program. Some people in this place will know that one of my former jobs was as a youth worker. I worked fairly extensively with young homeless people in the Ballarat community. It is a terrible thing to see teenagers who are unable to live in their family home or who, for reasons of social dislocation, do not even have a family home forced to sleep on the streets or in friends’ places, particularly in communities such as Ballarat, where temperatures over winter are just terrible. We have acute housing pressures in my community. There are acute rental housing pressures, particularly with two large universities. The university students desperately seek accommodation at the start of each year, which means that the market for private rental accommodation is extremely difficult for homeless teenagers. What we have seen with the SAAP program over the course of this government is an erosion of funding for homeless people. That is basically what we are talking about with the SAAP agreement that is being negotiated at the moment. With the government’s own report clearly stating that there needs to be an increase in SAAP funding, it is totally inadequate to begin negotiations with only a two per cent increase and also to be trying to take money out of that program to get the states to do some different work. If the government wants the states and territories to get involved in innovative projects for the provision of public housing and in devising better housing models for homeless people, then funding for that should be provided in addition to the money that is provided directly; it should not taken out of the program money. Homelessness is a terrible problem in this country. It is often a very hidden problem in this country. Although we do not have as great a problem as those countries overseas with large numbers of people sleeping in railway stations and in the streets, it does not mean that the problem is not there. The problem in many communities is a hidden problem, and the government needs to take very seriously not only the way in which it funds homelessness programs but also the way in which it deals with people who are in the worse possible circumstances they could be in. It is also important for the government to understand the incredible pressures homeless people are under, such as Centrelink regimes which force people to report more regularly, to find more work and to report again not just to Centrelink but also to the Job Network providers. When you are homeless, that is an incredibly difficult thing to do. It is incredibly difficult just to manage your basic hygiene when you cannot even find access to a shower. For the government to have a fairly punitive scheme that breaches people on Centrelink benefits and, at the same time, to say that it is not going to provide funding for homeless people or that it is going to reduce the funding over time under the SAAP is a pretty meanspirited thing to do. I encourage the government to take its responsibilities for all Australians MAIN COMMITTEE very seriously, to look seriously at the negotiations it is undertaking with the states and territories in relation to SAAP and to come back to the table with an offer that matches what its own inquiry into SAAP has shown-that there is a need for a 15 per cent increase in SAAP funding, not a two per cent increase and not money taken out of that area in order to create a situation where the states and territories are having to take money out of their own programs to look at matching the funding of the Commonwealth’s innovation. Some other issues that I very briefly want to raise are in relation to Regional Partnerships. We have read quite a lot of debate in the parliament and in the media about the Regional Partnerships program. One issue I particularly want to highlight is a circumstance that occurred in my own electorate. Whilst we have had some Regional Partnerships funding, we clearly were not a targeted seat in the last election. We received around $700,000. A project was announced recently which increases that amount to a range of projects, but we were after some larger ones as well. If you compare the funding we received to that of the seat of Bass, which received $12 million out of the Regional Partnerships program, you cannot under any circumstances say that this program made a fair distribution, a transparent distribution, of money to regional seats. I certainly do not think we have heard the last in relation to Regional Partnerships. It is an important program, but it needs to be applied fairly to all regional areas. provides members with an important opportunity to raise issues of particular concern to their individual constituencies, but it also offers us a chance to comment more broadly on general economic matters as they affect our constituents. I want to state up front in this debate my concern about the adverse impact of the government’s economic policies on households, individuals and businesses in the Geelong region. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick-you have been to my constituency on some occasions-the Geelong region has a vibrant economy. We have a highly skilled work force, a very well developed research and development capacity and some additions to essential infrastructure that will propel the economic growth of the region into the future. We are indeed fortunate in our community to have achieved what we have under the economic policies of this government. Households and businesses in Geelong have recently been hit not only with rising interest rates, which has impacted quite heavily on household disposable incomes, but also with an increase in private health insurance premiums. The head office of the private health fund government’s betrayal of its promise to keep private health insurance premiums low is now biting very deeply into the wages and salaries of my constituents in Geelong. Last night I was at the dinner put on by the Federated Chamber of Automotive Industries for parliamentarians and industry, at which the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations delivered the keynote speech. His solution to Australia’s ills and woes-which, by the way, he is responsible for creating-is to further depress the wages and salaries of Geelong workers. So, on the one hand, his solution to the economic problems facing the nation is to depress the wages of my constituents. On the other hand, he is ramping up their costs in the form of higher interest rates and higher private health insurance premiums. I want to go to the issue of the government’s economic performance. The government is now squandering the economic legacy left to it by Labor.

233,Mr Gavan O’connor (Corio) (11.53 A.m.),"The debate on the appropriation billsas a nation are over their ears in debt. We are facing interest rate rises. We have a plethora of reports that indicate that we face a skills shortage that will shortly feed into the inflation rate and therefore into interest rates. We have large bottlenecks in infrastructure that will choke future economic growth. Our research and development effort is extremely poor compared to that of our competitive trading partners and our productivity growth has slumped from the rate of 3.2 per cent that we enjoyed from 1993 to 1999 to 1.8 per cent. There are some very disturbing signs on the economic wall. Economic reports delivered late last year by the IMF and this year by the OECD and the Reserve Bank have all belled the cat on the poor economic performance of this government. The government laud their economic performance. If you listened to them, you would think that they invented economic growth, low inflation rates and low interest rate regimes. You would think that they were solely responsible for massive decreases in industrial disputation. You would think they were the only ones who ever brought a budget into surplus. I think it is important and instructive that we go to the historical record. Let me put on record that Labor left four years of four per cent economic growth to the coalition. You would have to be a bunch of dummies to squander that. Yet the Treasurer gets up and quite cleverly says that under the coalition we have had four per cent growth over the past nine years. What the dishonest Treasurer should be saying is: ‘Labor left the coalition with four per cent growth over four years and we are very thankful for it.’ But it is like the old Demtel commercial: is there something new in what the government is saying? You would think that a low inflation rate regime was all of their making. Labor broke the back of Liberal inflation. Liberal inflation was running at 10 to 11 per cent when Labor came to power. Of course, the Prime Minister does not mention that when he was Treasurer we had double digit unemployment, double digit inflation rates, double digit interest rates and an economy that was growing backwards. That was the economic legacy of the current Prime Minister. He and the Treasurer have the gall to get up in the parliament to claim credit for the performance of the economy. Let it be a matter of public record that the Australian Labor Party in government left the coalition with four years of four per cent growth. We broke the back of Liberal inflation, reducing it from 11 per cent to two per cent, and set the basis for the low interest rate regime that Australia has enjoyed-and which is now being squandered. I dare not mention debt and the trade performance. Well, on your insistence I am persuaded to mention debt! The country is laden with Liberal debt; it is being weighed down with Liberal debt. Why do I say that? When the Treasurer was in opposition, he was quite a clever economist-as suburban lawyers are-and, given his level of economic expertise, I, as a poor university trained economist, not having the benefit of the great legal background of the Treasurer, can only go on what he says in mounting the figures! He took the debt of Australia and divided it by the population and said, ‘For every man, woman and child, this is the debt’-let us say it was $10,000 per head-‘and that is terrible, because it is all Labor debt.’ He knew it was not all Labor debt but, as my Uncle Pat used to say, ‘Some people are as crooked as a dog’s hind leg.’ That is an old country saying, as is: ‘Some people cannot lie straight in bed.’ The member for Lyons would know the saying and so would the member for Hinkler. We are all country boys and I do not think I am breaching parliamentary privilege when I say that the Treasurer, in using those statistics, was as crooked as a dog’s hind leg. But far be it from me not to use the Treasurer’s analysis because he must be right! If we take the foreign debt MAIN COMMITTEE now and divide it by the population we find that it has doubled. We now have Liberal debt; we have a doubling of Liberal debt. Where is this going to end? In answer to that question you could say that our salvation would lie in our export performance. He is a great contributor to the parliament and he is one whom we on this side of the parliament happen to respect. We do not have much respect for the Deputy Prime Minister and his moralistic posturing on all manner of things, but I will not go into that. Suffice it to say that I acknowledge in the chamber today the honourable member for New England. I was referring to what is going to be our salvation. Of course, one would look to the export performance of the nation as a possible indication of whether Australia is going to get out of the position that it is in. Under Labor, the average annual growth in exports of goods and services was 10.8 per cent over all of our 13 years. You have to get your head around that average. When we took government we took over a ramshackle economy where exports were low. We not only had to clean out the Liberal mess left to us by the Liberal Treasurer who is now the Prime Minister of Australia, but also had to rebuild the economy. So you have to get your head around that the average annual growth in exports of goods and services was 10.8 per cent in all of Labor’s 13 years. The coalition was left an economy growing at four per cent, an inflation rate at two per cent-courtesy of Labor breaking the back of Liberal inflation-and a whole host of economic parameters that were favourable. One would have expected that the growth in exports would have been in excess of 10.8 per cent. That would be a reasonable assumption given the growth in the world economy and in the Asian economies. But, of course, that is not so. When we take the average of the coalition’s performance as far as exports are concerned, it is 5.8 per cent over the time that they have been in power. When I get on my feet in this House and talk about the adverse impacts of this coalition government’s policies on my constituents, you had better believe that they are starting to hurt. Let us have a look at the impact on household mortgages, because it is substantial. Many of my workers do not earn large amounts of money. In some of my manufacturing facilities the average wage would be in the region of $25,000 to $32,000. In many of those families the second person in the household works, and they have managed through their collective income to get a slice of the action in the housing market to upgrade or renovate their housing and they have gone out on a limb with the available income that they have. Even a 25 base point increase in interest rates has the capacity to hurt them. Do not believe this is the only interest rate rise under the current Howard government. This is the fifth interest rate rise, and there is a very substantial impact being felt in households as a result. This particular interest rate rise has added $34 to the average monthly repayment of households. For many households with several children who have just gone through the expenditure of putting their children through the education system, be it state or private education, there are substantial costs involved there. They have had to find extra money for private health insurance premiums and now they get hit with higher interest rates. Let us look at average monthly repayments. In March 1996, they were $922. In 2005, they are $1,541. Families are paying $619 extra per month as a result of the interest rate rises.

235,Mr Gavan O’connor,"The honourable member for New England is in the chamber.I did not think anybody in my electorate was under any misapprehension of what the Prime Minister was saying about interest rates during the election campaign. He was saying, ‘You vote for me, and interest rates will not rise.’ That was the message that came through. Why do I say that? Because many of my constituents came to me wanting to talk about politics, interest rates, the issue of Iraq and a whole lot of issues around this election campaign, and one central issue was interest rates. They expressed their concern that, if Labor were elected, there might well be an increase in interest rates and that, if the coalition were elected, interest rates would stay the same. I indicated that that was not the historical record and that, if the coalition were elected, they would more than likely face two interest rate rises in the first half of this year. I have been right about one and I suspect by July there will be another that will further tighten the screws on the household incomes of those people. Once again the Prime Minister gets up in the parliament and wants to portray the coalition as the government of low interest rates. I do not deny history and I do not deny 17 per cent interest rates under Labor and I do not deny any of the conditions that existed at the time they happened. I am not so dishonest as to deny it, so I want the Prime Minister to get up and say to the Australian people: ‘Yes, when I was Treasurer business loans under my tutelage were 15.8 per cent.’ Does anybody in the parliament think he would do that? No, he would not. He would not because of the Prime Minister’s and this government’s lexicon of deceit over a whole range of issues, from the GST, to Tampa and refugees-down we go-to the privatisation of Telstra, to Iraq and now interest rates. Where does the dishonesty of this government end? When are we going to get governments fronting the Australian population and telling them the truth? Of course we had the nauseating sight of the $66 billion man trotting around the country with an expenditure clock ticking over at a rate that cannot even be accommodated in words in this debate. It was quite extraordinary. Make no mistake: the budgetary expenditures of this coalition government will directly feed into interest rates. Those interest rates are affecting my portfolio responsibilities as well. The National Farmers Federation in a press release computed what this government has cost farmers as an extra $120 million to their bottom line. So over the interest rate rises that we have had one would say that in the region of half a billion dollars of costs have been added to Australian agriculture as a result of the actions of this particular government. More interesting was this particular statement by Mr Burke of the NFF: “Higher interest rates will push the exchange rate higher, damaging exporters and fuelling more imports ... There it is: the higher interest rate regime will push the exchange rate higher and will damage exporters even further. Australian interest rates are higher than those of Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Holland, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States and they are by significant amounts-and Australians want to know why. Why is it that the interest rates that they have been paying over the life of this coalition government have been so high in relation to those paid by American, Japanese, Swiss et cetera households? That is a fair question, one which the government cannot even answer. Let me say in conclusion that the economic policies of this government are starting to hurt my constituents. They are putting the squeeze on the household incomes of Geelong people through increases in private health insurance premiums and rises in interest rates, and those will not stop. The Prime Minister stands condemned for his deceit. MAIN COMMITTEE contribution of the member for Corio. Having been a farmer-and I still am one-particularly during the eighties when interest rates were of a very high magnitude in those days, obviously I know they did a lot of damage to a lot of people. But I do take the point that the member for Corio was making that the debate really does have to start to address the relative notion of Australian interest rates compared with those of our global competitors. I think there would be some quite salient messages in those comparisons. If we were to go back to the mideighties, even though our interest rates were higher, in terms of relativities, than some of our trading competitors’, there would be some very important messages that the government and community should be looking at. I think we as a society have tended to probably look too closely at the impact that interest rates are having now in relation to home owners and the debt burden and credit lines that ordinary individuals have, rather than at what happened in the eighties when, even though they did have a massive impact on individuals, the impact that they had on the productive sector was quite enormous. I think that in a lot of ways we are still feeling some of those impacts to this day. I believe that the government really does have to stop making the constant comparison that, if we are under 10 per cent, we are doing relatively well in Australian terms-and the Treasurer tends to use similar phrases to that-when getting people to think back to the very high rates of 23 per cent in the eighties. But a 10 per cent rate compared with those of our trading partners-and the member for Corio explained a few of those-is very high. Even eight per cent is one of the highest in the developed world. If we are constantly saying to our exporters and our productive people that we should be out there being globally competitive, interest rates are a very important part of that. There are a few things I would like to talk about that relate to the general economic performance of the nation. One of them is the current account deficit that was recently announced-in the same week as the Reserve Bank announced the increase in interest rates. I know this is a very broad issue and we are not going to cover it in this particular forum-I am pleased that the member for Hinkler is here too, because I think he may well share some sympathy with some of the things that I am about to say-but, if we are looking at the current account, we are looking at imports versus exports. I think most of us understand that. What we have tended to talk about-and what the Dalrymple Bay discussions have been abouthas been increasing capacity to improve export performance so that the equation can be turned around. No-one can argue about that. I think we want to grow better wheat varieties and try to export more product. We have got a new CRC for the beef industry at the University of New England which is being headed by Professor Bernie Bindon and which is going to do extraordinary things for our productive capacity in the beef industry. Hopefully that will flow on in terms of exports. But one of the things we tend to be ignoring is the rate at which we import. That is how we have created the problem: we are importing far more than we are exporting-hence, we have a current account deficit. We as a nation-and the government particularly-do not seem to be looking at import replacement. What are the things that we can do domestically that can legitimately replace some of the imports that are having this impact on the current account? One of those areas in my view is renewable energy. This relates to the fuel debate and very MAIN COMMITTEE",203,Gmhba Is In Geelong We Have A Very High Take Up Level Of Private Health Insurance The
236,Mr Windsor (New England) (12.13 P.m.),"I was very interested to hear parts of thedirectly to the ethanol and the biodiesel industries-those industries which can produce domestically to replace product that we currently import from other parts of the world. I know the member for Hinkler and other National Party members along the Queensland coast would be concerned about the future of the communities along that coast with the demise of the sugar industry generally and the impact of the Brazilians on the sugar price. But I do not think any of them are looking closely enough at what we can do in sugar and grains to bypass the need to export some of our products and to incorporate in the economic equation some of the environmental and health benefits that will come from the production of renewable energy through ethanol and biodiesel with the high octane ratings that can be obtained by the addition of a natural product rather than an unnatural one, as is happening so much in the fuel industry at the moment. What we have in Australia is an agricultural sector-a very important export sector with a very important impact on the current account-that essentially faces a corrupt world market when it comes to producing grain. I am a grain producer. I was on the Grains Council before coming into this place. We export grain at a price which is determined by others and, in the main, it is what I would term a corrupt world price. I know that domestic sorghum prices at the moment are the same as they were 25 years ago. There has obviously been a productive effort going into yields et cetera to improve the domestic viability of sorghum producers, but in exporting the product and having a positive effect we are at the behest of corrupt world markets. What do we do once we compete globally with that product and sell it onto that world market? We bring some of that money back home and then we enter another world market that is corrupt-the world oil market-and bring some of that product into the nation at a price which is escalating quite dramatically. This morning I have been talking to some scientists at the Science Meets Parliament initiative, which I think is a great program and I got a lot of value out of talking to the people I met this morning. While discussing energy sources and renewable energy, I was informed that it was not outside the realms of imagination that the US barrel price for oil could go from $US40 to $US80 in the long term. What are we doing domestically with renewable energy to overcome some of those issues? We had this great struggle in this parliament last year in an effort to encourage the ethanol industry-a struggle which virtually took 12 months to increase the excise freedom period to allow private sector investment in a domestic industry that could import replace. We still have this negative attitude within government towards the possible mandating of the use of renewable sources of energy, such as ethanol in our petrol. We still have this negative attitude that, if 10 per cent were mandated, there would be a loss of taxation revenue and, in the very next breath, we have the Treasurer and others saying that we have to be globally competitive, that we have to be out there-that, if we cannot face the market, a lot of our industries do not deserve to survive. When you are shackled with a 50c per litre taxation regime on the development of a renewable energy industry, it really says something about what we are doing to encourage some of these newer industries. The Prime Minister made an important statement in the parliament during question time a couple of weeks ago which I applauded. It was in reply to a question that I asked the Prime Minister about mandating the use of ethanol in petrol. That is not a new issue. A lot of members of parliament, various scientists and others have raised the issue in the past, but the fact MAIN COMMITTEE is that we have done nothing about it. If we want to guarantee the existence of a renewable energy industry with biodiesel and ethanol, we are going to have to mandate; otherwise, the oil companies will always have the upper hand in dictating the terms to the farming community who might produce some of this product. I applaud this statement by the Prime Minister. I just hope there is some backing behind it and some pressure in the cabinet and the party rooms to push this issue. He stated: ... if the scientific and other evidencethose words ‘other evidence’ are very important, in my viewcoming before the government were to change, I would certainly be willing to change my mind and I am sure my colleagues would be willing to change their minds. We do not have any prejudice against ethanol. We do not have any prejudice against the people who are promoting it. I think this is going to be very important for many of us in this place now, irrespective of our political attitudes, and I include the Australian Labor Party in that too, because I think they made a tactical error in pursuing for so long the relationship between the Prime Minister and the Manildra Group’s Dick Honan. I know there was some political capital in that, but there is no doubt that it did harm to the promotion of a legitimate renewable energy source. I remember having a meeting with the former Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham, and two of the proponents of the ethanol industry-Matthew Kelly, from Gunnedah, and Bill Elliot, from Dalby, whom the member for Hinkler would be familiar with. The purpose of the meeting was to suggest to the then Leader of the Opposition that it was time to move away from the political game playing with the Prime Minister over any relationship that he may or may not have had with Dick Honan and start addressing the issue in the terms in which it should be addressed: health, renewable energy, the current account, regional development, the investment that would take place, the job creation that would take place, the social impact of ethanol production on the Queensland coast if a certain percentage of sugar production were turned over to the production of fuel, and the impact on underwriting the grains industry west of the range. These were all things we were talking about in the rhetoric of regional development and which the development of this industry can help deliver. SoI encourage government members in particular, but also the opposition, to look at these issues in terms of regional development. I thank the Prime Minister for essentially opening the door to some real consideration of the issue, and I hope the new Leader of the Opposition embraces that as well. There are a few other issues I would like to raise. With the changes in the Senate, the sale of Telstra is obviously going to be on the agenda. I appeal to the other country members of the parliament, irrespective of their political backgrounds, to oppose this sale. In fact, I believe there is a 60:40 chance that it will not be sold. Obviously I do not think that will happen because somebody will suddenly jump up and cross the floor, but a whole range of reasons for the no sale agenda could come through. I encourage the political party members, in their backrooms, to start to show some spine on this issue. It is very important. In the last month, a lot of time has been spent talking about the lack of infrastructure in Australia. Telecommunications is the very form of infrastructure that will negate distance as a disadvantage of living in the country. We can talk about railway lines, roads and Dalrymple Bay, but if we do not get telecommunications right-that is, country people getting equity of access, pricing regimes et cetera-we will be doing the greatest disservice we have ever done to country people. It is the technology we need for the future. For anybody to suggest that a MAIN COMMITTEE fully privatised and perhaps partly foreign owned Telstra, of the magnitude that it will be and having the ownership structure that it could have, would be concerned about the smaller and medium sized communities of regional Australia is absolutely beyond belief. SoI ask the member for Hinkler to convey my words when he can. I do not want to verbal him, but I am sure that he has some sympathy for some of the arguments that are being expressed. In just the last week there has been confusion on this issue. The Deputy Prime Minister said to the Outlook conference that he is concerned about Canada, Japan and some of our trading partners having 20 times the internet speed that we have. If he is concerned about that, Telstra is obviously not up to scratch and we should not be selling it. On the same day, in Longreach, Senator Boswell, the Leader of The Nationals in the Senate, made some comments along the lines of: ‘Oh no, we’re all united on this. We’re all behind the sale.’ Incoming Senator Barnaby Joyce said in the Courier-Mail that he still has concerns about whether it is up to speed or up to scratch-what that means, I do not know. The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts says it is all okay. She was wandering around Queensland somewhere saying, ‘We’re going to have a review, and we’ll do that every five years.’ The next day another incoming senator made a groundbreaking announcement by saying, ‘We don’t want a review every five years, we want one every three years; so that will potentially kill the problem.’ I bring the House back to a legitimate point the Prime Minister made about our Constitution. One government cannot bind a future government to anything. So for people to say that through CSOs, community service obligations, they can guarantee service delivery for technology that has not been invented yet is almost farcical. I urge those people to oppose the sale of Telstra. In the limited time available to me I would like to raise a current issue in my electorate: the visa problem faced by the Bruderhof community, a religious order that lives near Inverell. This community has been involved in a number of business activities. It is a great community, a family based community of a religious order. It is having real problems in relation to the extension of visas to remain in this country, particularly at a time when we are talking about how we need people with skills, we need people who will invest, and we need people in country communities to aid those communities with their economies and intellectually and to be part of the rebirth, in a sense, of the nature of families in country communities. They are one of the great assets that we have. I find it quite sad that we have an immigration policy that is looking at sending many of these people back to America. I am pleased to say that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, is currently looking at this issue, but I appeal to the Prime Minister to involve himself in the matter. If we are serious about skills and if we are serious about the growth of regional communities, where there has been a drop-off in population that recent evidence has suggested may well continue, I think we have to start to have some degree of flexibility-not open the floodgates to a lot of the ratbag religious elements across the world; but where there are legitimate, god-fearing, family oriented, business oriented people who want to make a contribution to Australian communities we need some flexibility in relation to the regulations of the immigration act. It can be done; I have looked closely at it and I know there are a number of consultants who have looked closely at it. It is an issue that the government can rectify and I would ask them to look very, very seriously at the message we are sending to those people who want to live in Australia. MAIN COMMITTEE These people have their particular religious ways but they do not impact on anybody else in an adverse sense-and, in fact, they are having a very, very positive impact on the people and the community where they are located at the moment. They export signs to the United States: they probably make the best three-dimensional signs that you could ever see, and those you see in Sydney are quite distinctive. Many country communities have those signs now. They are exporting about 50 per cent of their product back to the United States. They are serious about the issues of why they have come to Australia. If we are serious about embracing people who consider family important we should be able to put in place a panel and a system of regulation that allows people who have strong religious beliefs and are part of a religious order to stay in Australia-without allowing a lot of religious ratbags to come into the country, as some people have concerns about. I thank the parliament for the opportunity to raise those few issues. There were other issues of water, medical schools and the changes to tertiary education that I had intended to raise, but I have run out of time. (Time expired) to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2004-2005. Central to the future prosperity of our nation is the need for serious attention to be given to Australia’s infrastructure needs. Infrastructure has been the talk of the town lately. It seems everywhere you go everyone is talking about infrastructure and the things that we ought to do. People are talking about the lack of investment in infrastructure and I think people are finally sitting up and listening to what needs to be done. You can pick up any paper and there is bound to be an article or two, or even more, focusing on infrastructure issues. The Financial Review and the Courier-Mail are two papers in particular which feature many articles on this topic. In my home state of Queensland, infrastructure is very topical. The Beattie government is currently investing a lot of time, effort and a lot of money in the state’s infrastructure future. The Queensland state government has released a south-east Queensland regional plan for public consultation which will, when finalised, put in place a framework for future growth and development for the region over the next 20 years. The funding and infrastructure strategy to complement this plan will be released next month. Infrastructure issues are not limited to Queensland or to my electorate of Oxley. The same issues are being discussed and addressed right across the country by other state and territory governments, and the reason is that Australia needs to reinvest in the nation and in its people by undertaking infrastructure projects which will ensure that our economy remains efficient, competitive and prosperous. It really is that simple. Smart companies enjoying good economic times invest in the future. They update their technologies, extend their factories, hire more workers and expand through investment. In short, they reinvest in the business and its people. You do not need to be an economist or a business master to understand that this approach is common sense and makes for a smart business strategy. I believe that same principle must apply for government. While Australia is presently enjoying a healthy surplus, with bundles of tax dollars falling to Canberra, now is the right time for the federal government to reinvest in the nation and its people. This can only produce positive results and can be done by investing in infrastructure and by increasing our productivity and efficiency. Although Australia has had 14 years of solid economic growth, we cannot afford to become complacent. By investing in infrastrucMAIN COMMITTEE",205,Gmhba Is In Geelong We Have A Very High Take Up Level Of Private Health Insurance The
237,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (12.33 P.m.),"TodayI want to speak on a range of issues in relationture and increasing our productivity, the Commonwealth can set the stage for another 14 years of continued economic growth. However, under the leadership of John Howard, the Australian government has done very little to pursue investment opportunities for the future prosperity of the nation. In fact, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development released a report on 1 March 2005 entitled Economic policy reforms: going for growth. This report-one of many released recently-confirms that, under the Howard government watch, public investment in Australia’s national infrastructure has been run down. The report states that since 1997 public sector investment, including in infrastructure, has slumped to around 2.2 per cent of GDP, the sixth lowest of all OECD countries. That compares with the previous period of 1990 to 1996, which recorded a level of about 2.6 per cent of GDP. Put simply, under the Howard government, investment in infrastructure has fallen in real terms. ‘Infrastructure investment’ are dirty words to the Prime Minister and his colleagues. According to the Howard government, this is an issue for the states, and the federal government will take every opportunity to lay the blame for Australia’s emerging infrastructure crisis at the feet of the state premiers and territory chief ministers. This, however, is simply not the case. We need leadership, not blame-shifting. For a national problem we need a national approach. These attempts to fix the blame on the states and the private sector are political games aimed at concealing the government’s own inadequacies and failures in this crucial area of public policy. For example, the member for Casey and the member for Flinders-who is Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage-delivered a paper solely aimed at diverting attention away from the Howard government’s gross mismanagement of the economy. These two gentlemen did, however, get one thing right in their paper and that is the need for a national approach to the emerging infrastructure crisis and the establishment of a national infrastructure advisory council. For that they should be congratulated. Ironically, their true purpose is to create a political solution, not a real policy solution. So here we have two government members entering a critical debate, probably under instruction from their political masters, with no real sense of the problem and with very disingenuous motives. To borrow a phrase, what they have been talking about and have been doing is ‘walking both sides of the street’. Labor has been calling for a national infrastructure advisory council for quite a number of years, but the coalition has steadfastly ignored that call. There are a number of worrying signs in our economy. The strength of the Australian economy over the last few years has been underpinned by consumerism, not by any structural reforms or investments, which are the long-term drivers of our economy. Instead of investing in future prosperity, the Howard government has simply frittered away taxpayer dollars on shortterm consumerism based policies and on short-term electoral cycle management. The lack of investment in skills and infrastructure is starting to produce undesirable effects in the economy. Last week we had a double whammy when the current account figures came out showing that we had low economic growth and interest rates hikes. The December quarter figures on the current account deficit were the second-highest in Australia’s history and the worse in more than 50 years at 7.2 per cent of GDP. Australia now has the highest foreign debt in its history, with $21,000 for every man, woman and child. When this figure was six per cent in MAIN COMMITTEE 1995, John Howard said that six per cent was a very bad figure. Under that assumption, 7.2 per cent today is a much worse figure and it is one which the government should be extremely concerned about. This flows on to foreign debt. Foreign debt is now $422 billion. It is 51 per cent of GDP. Back in 1994, Peter Costello said that a high level of foreign debt makes Australia more vulnerable. He was right. It certainly does. Australia’s economic growth slowed to only 0.1 per cent in the December quarter, the slowest quarterly growth rate since December 2000, and to only 1.5 per cent over the past year. Over the past two quarters, economic growth has been only 0.3 per cent. This means that the government’s forecast of three per cent growth for 2004-05 is highly unlikely to be met. The government should be worried, and it should also be honest with Australians. But its response to just blame the states is an approach that is starting to wear a little thin. In addition to its Economic policy reforms: going for growth report, the OECD also released an economic survey of Australia which confirms the need for further investment in the nation’s infrastructure to guarantee future economic growth. The OECD report confirms what many of us have known for a long period of time: that the government has become complacent about our economic future and that economic reform under the Howard government has stalled. The Reserve Bank of Australia, no less, has also highlighted that problems exist within the nation’s infrastructure. The RBA highlighted that skills shortages and infrastructure bottlenecks are hindering future economic growth and that these problems are the direct result of federal government complacency. In short, the Howard government has been asleep at the wheel; it has been fiddling while Rome burns. The only attempt by the Howard government to address the nation’s infrastructure needs is a program called AusLink, the national land transport plan. I have to say that this has been a complete fizzer. It is simply pork-barrelling dressed up as nation building. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, like his boss, also seems to believe that investment in the nation’s infrastructure is solely the responsibility of the states. The government and John Anderson have used AusLink as a political tool, their own personal plaything, to dole out money based upon what is the government’s agenda, in particular the National Party’s agenda, and to look after their best political interests rather than what is in the nation’s interests as a whole. Federal Labor does not object to the fundamental principle of AusLink and the need for the Commonwealth to take a long-term view of the nation’s land transport issues. To do so is common sense and good planning. However, AusLink as proposed by the Howard government falls well short of this mark. AusLink is woefully inadequate. The national land transport agenda should be an area in which the government should be showing leadership. AusLink is not nation-building legislation underpinned by the basic premise of what is in the nation’s best interests. It is pork-barrelling in the finest traditions of the Howard government and of the National Party. But, above all, it is a national disgrace and the people of Australia deserve better from their national government. Instead of getting national leadership from the Howard government on agreed priorities, we have a piece of legislation that seeks only to achieve political objectives of the Liberal and National parties. I could talk about the failures of AusLink all day, because there are many, but I think the real question here relates to the missed opportunities that are going by while we see plenty of regional rorts programs and plenty of the ‘in MAIN COMMITTEE my backyard’ types of programs, but we see very little in terms of the nation’s priorities and interests. By contrast, Labor has a proven track record in solid economic management and nation building. The Australian Labor Party has a long tradition of delivering great outcomes with respect to the nation’s infrastructure needs. The Australian Labor Party also has a long tradition of ensuring growth and productivity for the Australian economy. It was the Hawke and Keating governments of the 1980s and 1990s that first initiated the economic reforms that have paved the way for the 14 years of continued economic growth that this government enjoys today. It has been the Howard government which has failed to continue to invest in the future prosperity and growth of the nation and to fully capitalise on those reforms undertaken by Labor. Kim Beazley as Labor leader has made the party’s future policy priorities absolutely clear. Kim Beazley has declared that the backlog of infrastructure projects is one of the greatest challenges facing this nation and our immediate future. Kim Beazley and Labor have shown leadership on this issue, as we have done with economic reform in the past. John Howard and Peter Costello have shown absolute complacency and have been more interested in fixing the blame than fixing the problem. The last 20 years were about economic reform; the next 20 years ought to be about infrastructure reform and productivity gains. The government has a larger than expected budget surplus, close to $10 billion, on the back of ever-increasing taxes. The federal government has a responsibility to invest that surplus for the long-term economic future of our nation. A future Labor government understands what is needed from the Commonwealth to drive that future prosperity. John Howard only knows how to play politics. Australia needs a real reform agenda. If the federal government is to really achieve a national program of infrastructure development and productivity growth and efficiency it needs the cooperation of the states and territories. You cannot do this on your own; no government can. It needs to be a partnership of national goodwill-an approach ensuring maximum benefit to the entire nation. A national model to achieve this partnership has been proposed by a range of organisations, even by the government’s own Department of Transport and Regional Services, as well as the federal Labor Party, for quite a number of years. This partnership requires the establishment of a national infrastructure advisory council. Labor’s national platform and constitution, reaffirmed at the national convention in 2004, stated: Labor recognises that a strongly performing economy is dependent on adequate and efficient national infrastructure, particularly in the critical sectors of transport, communications and utilities. As such, we need to: ... contribute to the community’s well being by reducing traffic congestion and increasing mobility, and expand opportunities for economic development in regional Australia. Labor will establish a national infrastructure advisory council to coordinate a national strategy for infrastructure provision and maintenance according to strict, transparent and objective criteria. The establishment of this body must become a top priority for the federal government. A national infrastructure advisory council made up of industry stakeholders, government representatives and the private sector is needed as a matter of urgency. This body would examine and advise on the priorities for the nation and, more importantly, would be free of political interference. MAIN COMMITTEE At the very least, this country needs an expert body of advice to assist government in setting infrastructure priorities. Nationally important projects like the full upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway in Queensland or the Deer Park bypass in Victoria would not have been neglected for so long if we had had a national infrastructure advisory council. The national infrastructure advisory council will be the perfect forum to analyse, for example, the east coast rail link possibility. Infrastructure development, if properly costed and financed, is an investment that ultimately creates long-term economic benefits for the nation and becomes a key driver of jobs, innovation and growth. For this reason, we need national leadership. The federal government can no longer afford to simply blame the states. As a nation, we are all in this together. The states and territories require urgent investment in roads, rail, ports, water, energy and airports, and they should not be expected to do this in isolation. As Australians we have grown used to the idea of sustained growth, delivered over 14 consecutive years. Now is the time to make the difficult decisions about our future and the sorts of investments needed to sustain that growth into the future. A national infrastructure advisory council is that first vital step. This new body could seriously reduce the impact of parochialism and deliver outcomes based on needs over decades rather than simply the next election cycle. On7 July 2003, the Regional Business Development Analysis Panel presented to the Australian government their report Regional business-a plan for action. The panel was chaired by Dr John Keniry, Chair of Ridley Corporation, and it provided the Australian government with a range of actions on how to further continue the growth of regional business. According to the government’s web site, the fundamental rationale for the analysis was to consider ways in which the environment for ‘business in regional Australia, including access to finance, infrastructure, skilled employees, and better regional planning between business and all levels of government’ could be improved. Specifically in relation to infrastructure the report said: The inadequacy of infrastructure in regional areas was highlighted time and time again in both submissions and during consultations. Regional businesses told us that growth and development are often limited by the cost of upgrading or gaining access to basic infrastructure. Their needs in relation to infrastructure are simply not being met by this government. Most people already know that. I have already highlighted plenty of reports which recognise this fact. The only people who seem not to understand this are the Prime Minister and his government ministers-the people who are the most important in this debate. The report also acknowledged what we in the Australian Labor Party have understood for a considerable time period of time: infrastructure planning should be done in a coordinated way and within a national framework involving all levels of government. The report recommended that a national infrastructure advisory group be established that would: offer a coordinated approach to identifying infrastructure projects of national significance; and ensure that relevant projects are prioritised according to their ability to provide connectivity between regions and national and global markets. What did the government do about this recommendation? Nothing at all. It shelved it, dumped it, ignored it, pretended it was not there. It appeared in the AusLink green paper but not in the final white paper. Instead, the government chose the regional pork rorts approach to funding regional infrastructure projects. MAIN COMMITTEE The Howard government has squandered a once in a generation opportunity to continue economic prosperity. Instead it has chosen to fuel consumerism and to encourage personal debt and the largest current account deficit in 50 years. The government must swallow a very bitter pill and accept Labor’s advice. If it cannot bring itself to do this, it must at least take the independent advice from reports commissioned by its own departments and by the industry. Sadly, the Howard government, just like a spoilt brat, refuses to take its medicine or doctor’s advice. It has no plan to address the skills crisis and infrastructure bottlenecks that are acting as a brake on Australia’s future growth. I repeat: the Howard government has created an economy that is driven by unsustainable debt-fuelled consumption, not by exports and sustained productivity growth. As mentioned earlier, the member for Casey and the member for Flinders have argued for the development of a national infrastructure advisory council. They have even written to the Prime Minister arguing for national leadership on this news. Hooray-at least two members in the government actually understand! The member for Flinders says there should be a national infrastructure advisory council led by the Prime Minister to help identify Australia’s national infrastructure priorities over the next 30 years. The response from the government and from the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, has been very disappointing to say the least. The Deputy Prime Minister has spurned calls for a coordinated national approach to Australia’s emerging infrastructure crisis. This view is completely at odds with nearly every business and industry group in the country, the government’s departments and now even its own members. Capacity constraints affecting the nation’s rail, road and port networks are the result of the federal government’s complacency and lack of investment in Australia’s future economic prosperity. Instead of rejecting calls for a national infrastructure advisory council and blaming the states for Australia’s infrastructure crisis, the Howard government should be leading the debate. The Australian Financial Review sums this up succinctly: The time has come for John Howard, Australia’s second-longest serving prime minister, to put the stamp of national leadership on this most important of issues. A critical factor for funding infrastructure investments is the development of sound financial, accountable funding models. If infrastructure investment is undertaken wisely-and I use the word ‘wisely’-it can be a very powerful driver of the economy. Wise infrastructure investment can yield a growth dividend for the nation well into the future. Labor has a policy on the funding of infrastructure investment programs and a very clear national platform on the way that that financing would be undertaken. While most people acknowledge the importance of infrastructure investment, paying for such investment is in the end the critical issue. The Business Council of Australia has estimated that we need in the vicinity of $90 billion invested in infrastructure projects over the next 20 years-$40 billion in energy and $50 billion in roads, rail, port and water projects. It is an extraordinary amount of money. To put this in context, the Prime Minister spent $66 billion in 20 weeks last year, prior to the election campaign. So $90 billion over 20 years is in comparison very achievable, particularly when this money is expected to yield long-term dividends for the economy. To fund these projects will require the energy and attention of state and federal governments as well as the private sector. Public-private partnerships should be examined closely as a means of meeting these demands for large-scale investments in infrastructure. At the same MAIN COMMITTEE time, it should be understood that PPPs have limitations and are not the panacea to all funding issues which must be addressed. There only three ways to fund infrastructure, be it social or economic. The first is by the public purse, the second is by the private purse and the third, of course, is a combination of the two. In this context I draw the House’s attention to some comments made by Ms Katie Lahey, the Chief Executive of the Business Council of Australia. She said: We all have a clear choice. We can choose to make the changes that will provide continuing growth and prosperity for ourselves, as Australia did 20 years ago when we faced a similar economic crossroads. Alternatively, we can squander the opportunity and accept the consequences for ourselves and for our children. To sum up in the few seconds I have left, a future Labor government will be prepared and ready to meet these challenges head on, to tackle the big issues, to invest in our nation and to continue the legacy of reform of previous Labor governments. We know there are currently missed opportunities by this government. We are simply asking that the government step up to the leadership plate and actually tackle this issue head on. It is not just coming from us; it is coming from industry, from the private sector, from the government’s own departments and now from its own backbenchers. It is time the federal government took a leadership role on this issue. (Time expired) Ms HALL (Shortland) (12.53 p.m.)-The current state of the economy is of great concern to members on this side of the House. We only have to look at the recent increase in interest rates to realise that the promises made to the Australian people before the election have not and will not be delivered by the Howard government. With the current account deficit and these issues, there will be implications for the efficient, effective running of our economy. I have to say that this is of even greater concern because we are faced with these very poor economic indicators at a time when we have had really strong economic growth within Australia. Coupled with that is the fact that there is a lack of job security for many Australians and many Australians are really struggling. Some people have great difficulty in making ends meet. A large proportion of Australians are on very low incomes while other Australians are on high incomes-and the group in the middle have disappeared. That is something that is of great concern. But these are just general statements that I wish to make at the commencement of my contribution to this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005, the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2004-2005 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2004-2005 . Coupled with those general statements are the issues that surround the skills deficit that exists within Australia and the failure of this government to address those issues. I have recently been involved in an inquiry-and the report of that inquiry will be tabled next week in this parliament-and you can see, by visiting the web site or looking at the evidence that was received by the committee, that the skills shortage was one of the major issues that was raised. Under this government the skills shortage has been allowed to grow and instead of addressing real issues-such as ensuring that young Australians have the skills they need to find work or that retrenched people are given the assistance they need to retrain in another area-this government has abrogated its responsibility. Embracing skilled migration by bringing in 20,000 skilled immigrants to Australia does not address the needs of the Australian people; rather, the MAIN COMMITTEE government is throwing its hands in the air and saying: ‘It’s too hard. We can’t fix this skills shortage internally; we’re going to bring people in from outside.’ I really do not believe that that is the right way to go. I feel that there are many Australians who are going to be penalised by this approach. All the young people who live in the Shortland electorate who leave school starry-eyed and who would like to obtain an apprenticeship-and in that electorate young people, and the community as a whole, value apprenticeships-learn very quickly that this is not an option available to them. And that, coupled with the changes that this government has made to the higher education sector, has created a real problem for young people within Australia. Subsequently it has created a real problem for industries because they are unable to attract or retrain the workers that they need with the skills that they need to work in industries. This has been highlighted very well by the Australian Industry Group, who have been running quite a strong campaign on the need for skills within the work force. Within my local area they have identified many areas where there is a shortage of skills. We have poor economic indicators and a skills shortage. I would like to concentrate on the skills shortages in the area of health. That is an area that has had an enormous impact in my electorate. Currently there is a significant shortage of doctors on the Central Coast of New South Wales and in the northern part of Wyong shire, which is the part that falls within the Shortland electorate; there is approximately one doctor to every 2,000 people. This creates enormous difficulty for people living within that area because they are unable to see a doctor when they are sick. Recently my office was contacted by a woman whose husband was quite ill. She advised me that her husband needed a doctor’s certificate and the first available appointment was in two weeks time. That is a failure of the system and it creates enormous problems for people in her husband’s situation. It has been put to me by many people that if you are sick you need to see a doctor immediately-not in two or three weeks time. For the postcode 2262, which is on the Central Coast, there is one doctor for about 9,800 people. Those people have a significant problem when they need to see a GP. There is also a problem associated with the need to travel to see a doctor in that area. So this is an issue that must be addressed. It is something that the government needs to put its mind to. Traditionally, the Lake Macquarie area of the Shortland electorate has not been as hard hit by doctor shortages, but I have received notification this week of a seven-doctor practice that has only three doctors working in it. It did have five doctors but it lost one doctor earlier this year and it has just lost another one, and I believe one of the remaining doctors is working part-time. The practice is at a crisis point and, if something does not happen soon, the doctors are going to have to close it down. In the same area there is another doctor who is retiring within the next three months and another doctor has retired recently. You can see that the crisis that exists in the Central Coast part of the Shortland electorate will soon be evident in the northern part as well, in Lake Macquarie. I do not delude myself by believing that the Shortland electorate is the only one in Australia that has been affected in this way. This is a problem that exists throughout Australia. The issue of work force shortages in the area of health does not begin and end with doctors. That is the area I have highlighted here, but there is a chronic shortage of occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech therapists. No matter what allied health professional you name, MAIN COMMITTEE you will find that there is a shortage-and the level of shortages that exist within nursing is well noted. I argue very strongly that this is an area that needs addressing. We do not need rhetoric; we need action. It is about time the government acted to fix this matter. I now want to pass to the area of aged care. In the Shortland electorate and throughout the whole of Australia, there is a real shortage in the aged care area. We have a chronic shortage of aged care beds, we have waiting lists for aged care beds, we have phantom beds and we have waiting times for people to access community packages. We have an industry that is reeling under red tape and bureaucracy and, unless the government addresses this, it is older Australians who will be affected by it. It is time to act, and if the government does not act now then it is going to manifest itself by affecting all those older Australians and their families. Much has been made in the House about the Regional Partnerships program. The Tumbi Creek program on the Central Coast has been mentioned, and mentioned on many occasions. The Northern Lakes Family Centre, which operates within the Shortland electorate, has applied for funding on a number of occasions. It has tried to access funds through the Stronger Families and Communities program. It has made inquiries about funding from the Regional Partnerships program. It services a very disadvantaged area. It has been knocked back all the way along whilst, on the other hand, a similar service was funded at Warnervale in the electorate of Dobell-just as Tumbi Creek is in the electorate of Dobell-and given $135,000 just before the election. The government has to get its mind around the fact that outside government held electorates and outside marginal seats, there are real people who need services and assistance and rely on government. While people in those electorates may have elected Labor members to this House, still a large proportion of them voted Liberal and a large proportion of them rely on government. I do not think the standard for allocation of funds should be whether or not the electorate is held by Labor or is a marginal electorate; rather, I think it should be based on need. I turn to transport, an issue very dear to my heart, for which I am seeking support from the government. I hope that the government will be able to offer me some assistance. In this House, I have raised a number of times issues surrounding Aeropelican, which is a great little commuter service airline. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you and other members of this House may have travelled on Aeropelican, which travels between Belmont and Sydney. It was one of the few profitable services which Ansett operated. At the time of the Ansett crash, it went to the administrator. A number of companies were vying to purchase Aeropelican because it was noted throughout the industry as being a great little service which returned a profit to the operators. The successful tenderer was International Air Parts, IAP. They built it up again but it did not return to its previous status. It operated only six services a day between Belmont and Sydney as opposed to 13 services previously. From the time that International Air Parts purchased Aeropelican, rumours abounded within the area that IAP were going to sell Aeropelican, that they had another agenda, rather than the continued operation of Aeropelican. The first action was the selling of two of the planes from a four-plane fleet. The owner recovered a significant proportion of the money spent on purchasing them. The owner also operated Horizon Airlines, which, as most members would be aware, has subsequently gone into liquidation. Aeropelican was operated as a separate company and continues to operate. Two MAIN COMMITTEE planes were sold and rumours abounded that the owner was intending to force council to purchase the land, either under just terms of compensation at the highest possible rate or alternatively rezoning the land for residential development. This particular piece of land is on the shores of Lake Macquarie, which has been plagued by problems caused by overdevelopment around its shores. Aeropelican is vital for the area and is used by the residents of Lake Macquarie and Wyong shire. It has the widespread support of the community. When I am trying to book flights on Aeropelican, invariably I am waitlisted because the flights are full. On the last five flights I have flown, there have been no more than three seats vacant and on at least half of the flights I have flown, the plane has been completely full. The owner has entered into an agreement to sell the last two Twin Otters and, as of 2 April, he will be operating Aeropelican out of Williamtown. The bottom line is that people from Lake Macquarie, where I live, or the Central Coast are not going to travel to Williamtown. We are going to hop in our cars, go down the already clogged freeway and either get on a flight from Sydney or do our business in Sydney. The airline will not service the same group of people, and it is a loss of such vital, vital infrastructure to our area. very supportive of keeping the airline operating within Lake Macquarie. TodayI will place some questions on the Notice Paper that will address the question that the member opposite raised. I am not asking the government to come in and purchase Aeropelican. The operator says that part of the reason it is closing the airport is the requirements placed on it by the federal government. I would argue very strongly that the government is very mindful of changes that will be put in place because of the increased security requirements, such as the fencing requirements. I would also argue that there is money available to help operators with those expenses. WhatI am seeking from the government is support, and I do not think the government will be compromised in any way by providing the kind of support that I am seeking. This is a vital service. I would like the government to come out and say: ‘Yes, this is a vital service and something that we want to continue in Lake Macquarie. We’ve got provisions put in place to ensure that it is possible.’ I also want the government to have a look at the terms of sale from the administrator to make sure that the operator is in no way compromising those terms. To someone like me and to the community I represent, it looks very much like the operator bought Aeropelican with one thing and only one thing in mind-to strip all its assets, sell off the land, rezone it and make a profit at the expense of the people of Lake Macquarie and the Central Coast. I emphasise it is the only airport within that area. There is no train service in the northern part of Lake Macquarie going down to the northern half of the Central Coast. The people of the area rely on the airport. TodayI ask the government to join with me in supporting this vital service, in providing the kind of information that I know exists and in ending, once and for all, the furphy that Aeropelican cannot obtain the support it needs, that it is not the government’s fault that it is closing, that rather it is a decision of the owner and that there are other options.

239,Ms Hall,"Lake Macquarie City Council, which is held by Independents and Liberals, islenge I put to the owner of Aeropelican is that, if he cannot see his way fit to operate Aeropelican and if he is going to close down the airport, he should allow another operator to come in and operate out of that airport because it will be a long time before the rezoning comes through. If the government can work with me and help me with this issue, I would greatly appreciate it. (Time expired) Sitting suspended from 1.14 p.m. to 4.00 p.m. Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (4.00 p.m.)-This debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20042005 and cognate bills gives me the opportunity to raise some issues of growing concern to me and the community I represent insofar as this government’s management or mismanagement of the economy is concerned. I certainly believe that the chickens are fast coming home to roost and that this government must accept responsibility for its neglect of major issues that confront our communities and our economy insofar as future economic growth in this nation is concerned. I believe that the government has squandered many of the opportunities that came to it with the underpinning economic reforms that were instituted by previous Labor administrations. Let us go back and have a look at some of those. It was Labor that opened up the Australian economy, internationalised it and made it more competitive. It was Labor that broke the back of inflation in this nation. It was Labor that moved to a more decentralised, enterprise based system of wage increases that were linked to productivity improvements at the enterprise level. It was Labor that saw the need to increase our pool of domestic national savings and that introduced a retirement scheme underpinned by compulsory superannuation contributions. And it was Labor that managed to sustain economic growth rates in the order of 3½ to four per cent. All those achievements under previous Labor administrations did not come easily, but they were necessary and, at times, quite painful reforms. I know that because at the time. I was involved with the union movement and with some of the angst that was experienced, particularly as we moved from a highly centralised system of wage fixing to one that was more enterprise focused and linked to productivity based increases. So all the underpinnings for substantial and sustainable economic growth in fact flowed from the challenges and solutions that Labor brought to that economic agenda. I think what we have seen happen in the nine years of this administration is that a lot of those opportunities that were opened up under Labor have been squandered and a high level of complacency has set in. Serious economic reforms require vision and leadership, and that is precisely what has been lacking. The government has been able to take comfort in the changes that were introduced under Labor but has done little other than ride on the back of those changes for the last nine years. Let me cite one example. I was amazed to read the other day, on the front page of one of our daily papers, the Prime Minister exhorting people to leave school and take up an apprenticeship and trying to suggest that somehow there had been a cultural shift in this nation whereby university education was more highly valued than traditional trade training. There is no doubt in my mind that for a lot of families, particularly in the areas represented by people like me, in traditional Labor areas where apprenticeships have always been a highly sought-after career progression, the problem has not been the cultural mind-set of the people. The problem has been the lack of investment from this government over many years in the MAIN COMMITTEE TAFE and vocational education and training systems and the lack of incentives and encouragement for employers, particularly in small businesses, to hire young people. So, instead of actually acknowledging that we had a problem and dealing with it when the crisis was not as serious as it now is, the Prime Minister was quite happy to paddle along in the sea of complacency that had beset the administration. It is cold comfort to the families in my electorate to hear the Prime Minister talk about some very short-term expedient solutions to the skills crisis. He suggested that all we need to do is import more skilled migrants from overseas at a time when, in electorates like mine, there are youth unemployment rates of over 25 per cent and young people who traditionally would have entered an apprenticeship have been denied that opportunity for many years. The point I want to make is that the government has to accept responsibility. It cannot blame the states; it cannot blame cultural mind-sets; it cannot blame everyone but itself for the problems that are now so clearly visible. Those problems are most visible in the substantial slowdown in economic growth, such that in the last quarter the growth figure was in the vicinity of 1.5 per cent and in December it was just barely above the level where we would start to panic about the prospects of a recessionary downturn. We all know and acknowledge-and I hope even the Treasurer does-that capacity constraints are holding the nation’s economic growth back to levels that cause us all some severe disquiet. Those bottlenecks result particularly from the failure of this government to invest productively in areas like infrastructure, so we have huge bottlenecks in our transport linkages and at our ports. I know the difficulty I have had in gaining any federal assistance for the upgrade of the Princes Highway. More and more people are moving to the coastal strip. It is too easy to say that it is a state government responsibility when there is a huge migration flow into those coastal areas, and road and transport infrastructure is not able to cope with that urban expansion. In my area, 18,000 people in the Illawarra commute by car and via a totally inadequate rail system to Sydney for work every day and the state government alone is investing in the upgrade of facilities at Port Kembla to try and remove some of the pressures that are so obvious in the Sydney basin. The government has not invested adequately in the infrastructure that this nation needs to ensure sustained economic growth. Similarly, it has failed to invest an adequate amount into our human infrastructure, and that manifests itself with the wide range of skills shortages being faced across the nation. These capacity constraints mean that, inevitably, economic growth rates will slow. In that context, the Reserve Bank of Australia is forced to lift interest rates to contain potential inflationary pressures that may occur some way down the track. I want to say very clearly that there are no inflationary wage pressures in the system at the moment. The Treasurer is very lucky that what has prevented those inflationary wage pressures is, in fact, one of the hard decisions made by Labor when last in government to move away from a highly centralised system of wage fixing to one at the enterprise level based on productivity gains. So you cannot blame the workers on this occasion. Every day in the chamber it is the state governments that are blamed or it is people’s mind-sets or it is the cultural changes that have occurred or it is the workers or it is the ACTU. Clearly, it is about time the government faced up to its own failures. Those failures have not just suddenly arisen. In the area of skills shortages, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin, a recent inquiry resourced by the government and conMAIN COMMITTEE ducted by the Senate-the report handed down was called Bridging the skills dividereceived numerous submissions from people across the nation saying the same thing: this country is facing a very serious crisis of shortages in the skills required to drive economic growth and performance. And all employer organisations were saying that. I know because I particularly follow what the AiG say as I have a large manufacturing base in my electorate. They have been saying for some time now that there is currently a shortage of 20,000 skilled workers in manufacturing alone. The government has to accept responsibility for the crisis that now besets our nation. It is cold comfort to the people I represent to be picking up the papers and reading about the latest plan to import skilled migrants from overseas when our own youth are being denied the opportunities that they would have had in the past. Added to these capacity constraints is the problem that relates to the fiscal policy of this government. This was most clearly shown in the government’s recent spending spree-a commitment of approximately of $66 billion, which is now not disputed, over a five-year period to ensure its re-election at the last election. But a lot of that spending commitment is unproductive spending, and it has denied the government the opportunity to redirect those funds into productive investment. Short-term pork-barrelling, as we have seen most recently highlighted in the scandal of the rorts in the Regional Partnerships program, has to be replaced with productive investment. As I said, the chickens are coming home to roost. In the words of Ross Garnaut: Australia had entered a great complacency in which major threats to sustainable growth were being ignored. They can no longer be ignored. The government have to act, and they have to act decisively and stop shifting the blame onto everyone but themselves. I was appalled to read in the last couple of days that, on one of the key and significant issues of national infrastructure needs, our own Deputy Prime Minister has rejected a call for a coordinated national approach to Australia’s infrastructure crisis. His view is completely at odds with nearly every business and industry group in the country, not to mention that his views are also at odds with a number of his government colleagues, including the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Greg Hunt, and no doubt the private views of the Treasurer, Peter Costello. We all know that capacity constraints affecting the nation’s rail, road and port networks are the result of the government’s complacency and lack of investment in Australia’s future economic prosperity. What we need is a national infrastructure advisory council that can determine on an objective basis where investment needs to occur to right the failures of the past. We need to get away from the short-term politically expedient decisions that are made, particularly in the lead-up to elections where money goes to projects that, by any stretch of the imagination, are very low on the list of priorities. In my last electorate newsletter, I asked my constituents how they felt about approximately $130,000 being set aside to create a day care centre for dogs in Queensland, in the order of $100,000 being allocated to a tomato grower and funds of the same magnitude being expended on shifting lions at a private zoo. All that might be well and good, but when we have these severe capacity constraints in our economy surely there is a more objective, comprehenMAIN COMMITTEE sive and sustainable method of investment of taxpayers’ funds into areas that really matter to their future economic prosperity and living standards. I am going to do a bit more analysis on the rorts under the Roads to Recovery program, because every request I have made for assistance for funds to upgrade the Princes Highway has been met with the comment, ‘Well, that’s a state responsibility,’ yet if you look at the Roads to Recovery program and do an analysis of where the funds have gone-surprise, surprise!who heads the top of the list? None other than the Deputy Prime Minister. That has to end. And it has to end by this government doing the right thing by the nation, by supporting the creation of a national infrastructure advisory council which can objectively address the nation’s needs and determine outlays on an objective basis, not on the basis of what buys votes. The government must accept responsibility for not addressing the skills crisis. This problem has not just emerged this week. In fact, I looked back at a speech I made on the issue of youth unemployment in October 2003. At that time. I was quoting a very comprehensive study done by Dr Toner at the University of Western Sydney. What did Dr Toner’s study find? He went back to 1993. That is when the problem first started to emerge. He said: There was a ... decline of 16 percent in the ... apprentice training rate over the last decade from 1993 onwards ... By ‘training rate’ he means the number of apprentices in training compared with employed tradespersons-that is, the ratio of those in training to the number of people out there working in the trades. His analyses show that there was a major decline in the metal, electrical and electronic trades-a 19 per cent decline in metals and close to 25 per cent decline in electrical and electronics. His studies show that the number of apprentices in training also declined from 1993 onwards by an average of 15 per cent. His analyses show that, had the training rate been maintained at the 1987-1992 level, we would have had an additional 21,700 apprentices in training by 2001. I am not going to go on at length about these analyses other than to say that that kind of work was being done. Governments have departments that surely are there to advise them about the emerging problems that the economy faces, yet suddenly the crisis is upon us and nothing has been done in the interim to address that. What has been done has been painfully and woefully inadequate. The Howard government has underinvested substantially in technical and vocational training. We have estimated, based on research, that $833 million is the amount of the deficit in federal outlays by comparison to what the states were putting in. If John Howard’s government had matched state and territory rates of increase in investment in skills and training, this government would have invested an extra $833 million. Just imagine how many additional places we would have had in our TAFE system and our universities if we had had that level of investment rather than what we saw happening-that is, cuts to TAFE funding, an emphasis on trying to find money through efficiency dividends and a failure to meet the growth demands in the system. It is nobody’s fault other than this government’s that that investment was so short of the mark. Skills growth as a driver of productivity in our nation has dropped 75 per cent in 10 years. It is not something that happened yesterday; it is something that has been happening in this period of complacency by the government. We know that across the nation businesses are crying out for skilled workers. This skills crisis is jeopardising vital industry projects, particularly in the resources sector. It is driving up costs and wages and putting upward pressure on MAIN COMMITTEE interest rates. This government has been in power for nine years; John Howard has been running this country for nine years. Australia has a severe problem with capacity constraints and this government has no-one to blame but itself for the situation we find ourselves in. The end result of the economic challenges that beset our nation manifest themselves in increased pressure on the families that we are here to represent. Every increase in interest rates means increases in home mortgages. In April we will see increases in the cost of private health insurance. In my electorate-and no doubt in yours as well, Mr Deputy Speaker-the cost of petrol is at an all-time high. These issues impact on the ability of families to sustain their standard of living. This is putting pressure on people, particularly at the lower end of the income scale, and at the end of the day it is easier to talk in platitudes, to blame the states and to blame everybody rather than to accept blame where blame rests. The chickens are coming home to roost and there is only one government and one person responsible for that: the Prime Minister and his government. (No. 3) 2004-2005 and cognate bills. I would like to take today’s opportunity to speak about some important issues which are pertinent to the state of the Australian economy, but which are also causing concern in my electorate of Swan: the recent rise in interest rates and the government’s failure to put in place policy settings to ensure that such interest rate rises do not occur; the failure of the government’s policy approach to the provision of transport infrastructure, which is impacting negatively on all Australians; the inability and failure of Telstra, despite its full-blown rhetoric, to provide adequate broadband services to all Australians, but particularly to urban communities in my electorate; and the failure of the Minister for Health and Ageing to respond to the urgent need of my constituents in relation to an additional Medicare office and after-hours GP services. Since the parliament rose on 17 February, we have seen clear evidence of the government’s mismanagement of the economy. Indeed, an interesting sequence of events in economic statistics unfolded during the recent parliamentary break. First, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Ian Macfarlane, appeared before this House’s Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration on 18 February in Sydney and, in heavily coded language, foreshadowed a rise in interest rates at the beginning of March. He was particularly concerned about inflationary pressures, labour shortages and skills capacity. Second, the Treasurer, in a blatant attempt to soften up the commentators in advance of the Reserve Bank’s statement, commented that 10 per cent interest rates were not high. Given that many OECD countriessuch as Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Holland, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States-are enjoying lower interest rates than Australia, in some cases significantly lower rates, the political stupidity of this comment from a veteran of this parliament beggars belief. It is no wonder that this undisciplined comment has raised serious questions amongst Liberal Party backbenchers about his political judgment and, therefore, his leadership ambitions. On2 March the Reserve Bank announced an increase in the cash interest rate of a quarter of a per cent, or 25 basis points, to 5.5 per cent. The bank cited inflationary pressures and pointed to pressures on capacity, particularly labour shortages, as the basis for its decision to raise interest rates. Also on 2 March, the national accounts figures for the December quarter 2004 were released. Economic growth slowed to 0.1 per cent in the December quarter and to MAIN COMMITTEE",218,Gmhba Is In Geelong We Have A Very High Take Up Level Of Private Health Insurance The
240,Mr Wilkie (Swan) (4.20 P.m.),"I rise to speak in the debate on the Appropriation Bill1.5 per cent over the past year. This slowdown puts into question the budget framework for this year, which, of course, is the focus of these bills before the House today. As I noted in my address-in-reply speech to the Governor General’s opening of parliament, the government’s profligate $66 billion election spending spree was irresponsible and threatens the budget parameters. We are now seeing the results of the government’s economic irresponsibility coming home to roost. The sad truth is that this interest rate rise could have been avoided. It will add $34 in monthly repayments on the average mortgage and, in many cases, much more than that. Monthly repayments will rise by $48 a month for a home loan of $300,000 and by $64 a month for mortgages of $400,000. Needless to say, many families and businesses in my electorate will be adversely affected by the rise in mortgage, credit card and other interest rates. The Treasurer has clearly got his work cut out for him if he tries to minimise further interest rate rises while also attempting to honour his leader’s and The National Party’s excesses before and during the election campaign. This brings me to the second issue which I would like to raise today, namely the urgent and overdue need for a clear and substantial transport infrastructure agenda. Much has been said in the House about the lack of transparency, accountability and prudence in the government’s regional programs. These are nothing short of slush funds, which have been spent to shore up incumbent members mainly in the coalition’s marginal seats. The National Party in particular has put the pork back into barrel. As the appropriate processes of parliament unravel the lack of due process in many of the regional grants, the coalition-particularly The National Party-should hang its head in shame. The Deputy Prime Minister likes to parade himself as one of parliament’s nice guys. But what a crock! Behind his King’s School veneer is a precious, easily bruised individual who is indecisive and unfit to hold the office of Deputy Prime Minister. He is an embarrassment to the Liberal and National Parties, and they know it. Only this week, the Deputy Prime Minister was forced to admit that he had secured funding for the accreditation of a child-care centre in his electorate, having previously denied that he had. What makes this child-care centre eligible for funding for accreditation, as opposed to the other 4,800 child-care centres in the rest of Australia? It is just one factor-it is in his electorate. That the Deputy Prime Minister is so inept that he cannot even indulge in the National Party hallmark of pork-barrelling without being so explicitly biased is embarrassing. His indecisiveness is legendary. Last year we saw the unedifying spectacle of the Deputy Prime Minister promising the Minister for Trade that he would leave the leadership, only to see him renege on this arrangement within a few days. The Deputy Prime Minister bullies industry associations and organisations to come out and defend his dubious and rort-ridden programs and sulks when judgment gets the better of them and they refuse his requests. He has not a skerrick of credibility in him. Yet, he has that ever so pained look whenever anyone has the temerity to criticise him. He has presided over one of the worse examples of political expediency in the form of regional rorts that we have seen for many years. The very fact that the Liberal Party has allowed the regional rorts program to exist is an indictment of their economic credentials and their management of the economy, and in particular their inability to reign in their coalition partner’s indulgences. I suppose, though, that you could forgive the Treasurer for allowing some of these regional rorts to go ahead. I was reading, in an article called ‘$408 million slush fund’, that one of the grants that MAIN COMMITTEE went through was in Brisbane, where $138,000 was allocated to a doggie day-care centre. I am sure he would have approved of that. That would have been very good. I just wonder if this makes the Deputy Prime Minister his slush puppy. Above all, the imprudence of many of these regional grants highlights the failure of the government’s infrastructure agenda. What a visionary government, genuinely concerned about the future of the entire economy, including regional Australia, could have done with the same amount of money spent on transport infrastructure! For example, those funds could have been invested in bringing Australia’s transport infrastructure up to First World standards, to the social and economic benefit of all Australians. The National Party’s neglect of transport infrastructure, for which it has ministerial control through the current Deputy Prime Minister, in favour of rort-ridden regional grants is a disgrace that betrays the very people the National Party purports to represent. It came as no surprise to me, and many members of this House therefore, that the rural Independent members for Calare, New England and Kennedy were re-elected by their communities despite the Deputy Prime Minister’s paranoia about their continued presence in this parliament. Australia is approaching a national crisis in transport infrastructure. The Reserve Bank pointed to concerns about the capacity of national infrastructure in its assessment of risk to the economy when it announced the lift in interest rates. It is vital that the government address the chronic infrastructure investment problems. Instead, as we saw in early February, with the debate in this House about the AusLink legislation, we have a government intent on establishing a $150 million so-called ‘strategic roads program’, with the discretion for expenditure given to federal ministers. This approach denies the opportunity for nation building and the consequent improvements in productivity and competitiveness which could result for all Australians if there were a genuine commitment to removing transport bottlenecks around the nation’s highways. Let me give an example of this policy failure in my own electorate. The Great Eastern highway is the major arterial road linking Perth to the eastern states and therefore clearly forms part of the national highway. It is not overstating its importance to say that this highway is the lifeblood of Perth’s transport industry. However, the federal Department of Transport and Regional Services advised a Senate estimates committee recently that the section of the highway between Redcliffe and Rivervale has not been deemed to be part of the AusLink national network. It seems that the federal government has unilaterally decided that although the rest of the Great Eastern highway is part of the national network and therefore is eligible for federal funding, this particular section has been deemed ineligible for funding for the much needed and long called for road widening. Why? AmI being a little cynical or was this particular stretch of road omitted because it falls in my marginal Labor electorate of Swan and not in a coalition marginal electorate? Would this omission have occurred if the section of highway in question was located in regional Australia and not urban Australia? Would this section of highway have been widened if it was located in the Deputy Prime Minister’s electorate and eligible for a regional rort? The Southern Gazette community newspaper has published a number of articles about the need for the Belmont section of the Great Eastern Highway to be widened. Local residents are justifiably angry that their calls for funding to be made available have fallen on deaf ears in the federal government. Quite clearly, with most of the highway deemed by the federal govMAIN COMMITTEE ernment as part of the AusLink national network, this particular section should also fall within its national network. This is not rocket science. The federal government has consistently refused to fund this particular section, claiming it is a state responsibility. I have a very basic question: how can the federal government justify not including this section in the network when it has included the rest of the highway? It seems to me that the residents of Belmont, who are affected by the safety problems, congestion and time delays occurring in the absence of the widening of this vital road, are being treated as second-class citizens by the federal government. They are suffering the social and economic costs of a substandard road and this situation cannot be allowed to continue. I call on the Deputy Prime Minister to abandon his blatant bias in allocating road funds and respond as a matter of urgency to the needs of the Belmont community. They are Australians deserving of attention, even if they do not live in a coalition marginal electorate with which the Deputy Prime Minister is obsessed. Before the government responds by saying that the state government should fork out for this road funding, let me say that Western Australia is consistently short-changed with regard to federal road funding and that the federal government should cease this bias forthwith. Indeed, so pathetic and paltry was the recent allocation to Western Australia of funds under the AusLink program that we in the west called it EastLink. I call on all of my Western Australian colleagues in the parliament-in particular, Senator David Johnston, whose office is located on the stretch of highway in urgent need of widening-to join with me in pressing the Deputy Prime Minister to give Western Australia a fair deal in accessing AusLink and other federal road funds. The third area I would like to address today is the total and abject failure of Telstra to deliver broadband services to certain sections of my electorate. In this House, we hear a lot about the continued shortfall of broadband services to rural Australia. I agree that rural communities deserve a better deal from Telstra and this government. But let me explain to the House that the lack of broadband services is not just confined to country Australia. In the electorate of Swan, I receive many complaints about the failure of Telstra to deliver broadband services. Let me give you a couple of examples. A constituent of mine, Michelle, who lives in Kewdale, was recently informed by Telstra that she cannot have an ADSL line because, according to Telstra, she lives too far away from the exchange. The exchange she lives too far away from is in Hardy Road, which is scarcely a long distance from her home, as those who know Perth will attest. Yet Michelle’s neighbours in Kewdale are able to access ADSL. On questioning Telstra further, Michelle was informed that the problem was not the distance the crow flies from her house to the exchange, but rather the layout of the lines. According to a letter received by Michelle from Telstra dated 23 February 2005, for her to access ADSL it would require a new telephone line and Telstra stated: A telephone line needs to pass various qualification checks before ADSL can be provisioned. Regrettably your nominated service line did not pass this testing stage ... Translating this bureaucratic obfuscation into English, Telstra is telling Michelle that it will not upgrade her line to ADSL because it would not be profitable for it to do so. In the letter to Michelle, Telstra goes on to say: Telstra trusts this information above fully addresses your concerns and will close this matter accordingly. MAIN COMMITTEE I have read this letter several times in sheer amazement. Indeed, it is an indictment of Telstra’s corporate management that such correspondence is permitted to leave Telstra’s offices. Telstra’s arrogance and lack of concern about its failure to provide a minimal service to Michelle is nothing short of breathtaking. But wait, there is more. Adrian and Denise of Cloverdale in my electorate wrote to me on 28 February to say: Sir, as a constituent of yours I would like to raise the issue of the supply of “Broadband” internet connection. In your inner city electorate I reside [in] Abernethy Road Cloverdale. Telstra first gave me the advice that [broadband] service was available in this location before I moved here some twelve months ago. This turned out to be incorrect advice which, had I been given the correct advice, I may well not have moved to this location. HoweverI did move and began using dial up service with another carrier when, in November, Telstra offered a trial of their Broadband service. This service concludes tonight and they (Telstra) have advised me that although I have been using [their] Broadband service that it will not be available to this area after today. Now Sir, I am not the brightest bulb on the Chrissy tree but this does seem a little like the big Corporation not having the will to supply the service? Maybe Sir you can find some answers for me please. So, basically, in an attempt to lure customers away from other providers, Telstra has offered a broadband service on a trial basis but has declined to continue that offer of service once the trial has finished. From an operating perspective, this begs the question: what was the point of the trial? From a service perspective, this begs the question: how can Telstra get away with such incompetent levels of service? To emphasise Telstra’s complete and utter disregard for its customers even more clearly, let me inform the House that Abernethy Road, where Adrian and Denise live, is not a side street or a laneway but a major thoroughfare in inner city Perth, housing many major industrial businesses along with one of Perth’s largest shopping centres-as well as households such as those of Adrian and Denise. This is not the first time that I have raised concerns in this House on behalf of my constituents about Telstra’s corporate arrogance. Only two weeks ago I raised similar concerns about Telstra on behalf of my electorate. Yet, despite millions of dollars which Telstra spends on government relations and schmoozing here in Canberra, has anyone from Telstra contacted me to address concerns since parliament last sat? No. I suggest that the organisation not only address its incompetency to deliver elementary telecommunications services but also upgrade its parliamentary monitoring systems so that it is made aware of the genuine concerns raised by members of this House. I remain astounded at the conceited and high-handed way in which Telstra is treating its customers, yet this is the outfit that wants members of this parliament to agree to its privatisation. It is only in the last month that Telstra has communicated to Michelle and Adrian and Denise admitting that it will not provide them with broadband. To add insult to injury, it is also only in the last month that Telstra announced its half-yearly after-tax profit of $2.337 billion. The clear message is that Telstra is reaping extraordinary profits while many Australians, even those in a major capital city such as Perth, are denied access to rudimentary services such as ADSL. MAIN COMMITTEE I can only imagine the greater difficulties that many in rural Australia face in adequate broadband coverage, yet the National Party, led by the Deputy Prime Minister with the glass jaw, are willing to cave in to the Liberals and support the sale of Telstra. Let me make a prediction: I have not been privileged to serve in this House for many years yet, but it is clear to me and other members that when, inevitably, the National Party’s flaky leader capitulates to the Liberals on the sale of Telstra the whole reason for the National Party’s existence will disappear. They will sell out their constituency and ultimately do themselves out of existenceall because they have not got the strength to stand up for the interests of rural Australia. It is not for me to offer gratuitous advice to the National Party, but if I were to do so I would suggest that the sooner the leadership ambitions of the member for Parkes are fulfilled the longer the National Party will last. Only a few weeks ago I drew the attention of the House to two significant problems in my electorate to do with health care services: firstly, the desperate need for a Medicare office in Belmont to serve over 30,000 residents who are currently forced to travel to Cannington for full Medicare office services and, secondly, the lack of after-hours GP services in the Bentley area. As I informed the House in February, of the 63 GP surgeries in the Cannington Division of General Practice, only 13 offer more than five hours a week of extended services and only three offer services on Sundays and public holidays. The Cannington Division of General Practice applied to the Department of Health and Ageing for assistance to extend after-hours services. Unfortunately, this application was rejected. I wrote to the Minister for Health and Ageing only three weeks ago asking him to address these two problems and to join me in visiting the electorate to see the problems for himself. Sadly, he has failed to respond. I thought the minister might welcome the opportunity to fix the problems in health services in my electorate. I was wrong. The minister has ignored my letter and, in doing so, has thumbed his nose at the people of my electorate, many of whom are elderly. I will continue to use all the opportunities I have to press the government to address these fundamental health service deficiencies in my electorate. For the sake of the families, the elderly and those with disabilities in the electorate of Swan, I urge the government to respond to these calls. Overall, it concerns me that the government’s mismanagement of the economy is manifesting itself in higher interest rates, that economic reform in the much needed national infrastructure agenda has stalled, that Telstra is able to get away with appalling levels of service in my electorate and that the government is failing to deliver improved health services in Swan. On behalf of my constituents, I will continue to press the case for these issues to be addressed as a matter of urgency. bills. It is always good to have those small mercies where one achieves something. To get to speak last on the appropriations is a windfall for me. This debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005 and related bills gives me an opportunity to talk about something that is obviously worrying a lot of people: the sale of Telstra. We have just heard the member for Swan outline some of the concerns in his electorate in the West. It seems to be worrying The Nationals as well, so I hope they are aware of the strength of the feeling out there in country areas. The sale of Telstra is going to have huge implications in country areas, because there is so much more to do if country area services are to be brought up to the level of those in urban MAIN COMMITTEE",223,Gmhba Is In Geelong We Have A Very High Take Up Level Of Private Health Insurance The
241,Mr Adams (Lyons) (4.40 P.m.),"I see that I am the last speaker on the appropriationareas. Communications in the country have always been extremely important, especially as lives can depend on reliable services. Communications can also play a role socially and in business so small towns and regional centres can be connected. They have to be good and they have to be reliable. A service that is driven by shareholders is likely to be looking at a different agenda. The trouble is that, if we talk about selling the government share of Telstra without fixing up the obvious problems of regional access and affordability, a whole nation can have pockets of disadvantage everywhere. Currently there are some sort of community service obligation regulations, but they are unlikely to survive many years after privatisation as successive boards look at the bottom line to see how money can be saved. The infrastructure will be threatened first. The lines, the optic fibre and the satellite access will all prove to be the areas where the most money needs to be spent and, therefore, will be subjected to higher costs. As it is, Telstra will have to spend $4 billion or $5 billion a year for the next decade to maintain its copper wire network and to invest in emerging technologies. Its baseline relies on that, and it is extraordinarily expensive to keep this going for all the other telcos that work off it. So the users will bear the brunt of these sorts of costs while Telstra plays around with deals on computer services, satellites and interactive multimedia. So how is country Australia supposed to be ‘future proofed’, and what on earth can that mean? The only way to really future-proof our standard communications lines is to have government have a say in what Telstra is doing. That can be achieved only by keeping Telstra in public hands. Other problems have been popping up as Telstra tries to clear the decks for sale. I guess everyone has heard about the situation with Lifeline. The telephone counselling service has been responsible for saving many thousands of lives and has made a difference to people from all walks of life and of all ages in helping them to come to terms with their various problems. Country areas have relied on these sorts of services, and it is not possible to get the sorts of sponsorships required to make this service possible. Because Australia has a small population compared with other countries, it is just not competent to compete in the same way for corporate sponsors. This service would have come crashing down if this government had not finally woken up to the seriousness of the position of Lifeline. But what after privatisation? The cost of calls over copper lines is also likely to change. If Telstra is to compete in the marketplace, it will have to keep charges up for access to Telstra lines. Currently it is possible to have a service that divides local call access all over a state. They do not do it, but it is possible and in fact should be available now. I have been arguing for years that Tasmania should be seen as one region and therefore local calls should be universal to that region. It has been Labor Party policy for the last two federal elections. Instead we have STD dialling between towns 40 kilometres apart, which is just a disgrace in today’s technological age. I seek a single zone of charge for telephone calls at the very minimum before the government could claim that it is taking notice of the community service obligations. Country people should raise their voices now and ask for it. It is not as though mobile phones are so efficient that people are prepared to trust them at all and not use landlines. Tasmania still has so many gaps and drop-outs that most people have to have mobiles and landlines. In my town of Longford neither CDMA nor GMS phones work in my house. I have to conduct phone calls in the garden with my mobile. That is fine in the summer, but I can tell MAIN COMMITTEE you that it gets pretty tedious in the winter. How many other country politicians have that problem, I wonder. The member for Hinkler is in the chamber. He is a member of the National Party and he is a man who tries to do the best he can, but I wonder if the phone works all over his electorate. In fact, there have been many emails running around this parliament and last session there was an email asking whether people’s CDMA phones worked or not. Mr Peter Lindsay, the member for Herbert, was very anxious to get some response, so he emailed the whole parliament. It does not sound as though he is very happy with the current service of Telstra in his area, does it? Perhaps he has to wander around the parliamentary gardens or his digs in his pyjamas, desperately searching for a signal. And here we are in the capital of Australia! But it is a little region compared to the great cities of Melbourne and Sydney, which command the majority of the services. Another issue of mobile phone coverage came up recently in the southern part of Tasmania in a lovely little place in the electorate of Lyons called Bream Creek. It has a winery and a dairy or two. It is on the way to Port Arthur if you turn left and go down towards the coast. Telstra kindly put a Telstra mobile coverage transformer there to cater for the many visitors and local people who attended the Falls Festival that has now been held for two years in a row over the Christmas and New Year period. But at the end of the festival residents were again left with a black hole as the service was taken away. It cannot be very difficult to keep a service in place once it has been erected. A similar situation exists close to my area at Cressy. In the end, public pressure ensured that the service was retained, which partially fixed the black hole for the mobile service in the area of my old home town. An email sent to me from Victoria recently said: Telstra joins us all at the hip, no matter where we live, what we do, or how wealthy or poor. Communications is the most vitally important and strategic tool we have left with which to face the future. Not only do we wish to see no more sold off, we would like to see a larger government share clawed back. Yet somehow country people are being denied the full communication services. Another person sent me an email expressing what I think is the fear of many people: We don’t want the American system where a phone call is an exercise in getting lost in nonsense as one is transferred from one telephone company to another at great expense and even greater delay and frustration. We do not want a marketing menagerie where competing phone companies spend money on complex, confusing stupid pricing plans with free calls offset by inflated, hidden charges. We do not want the bulk of our money spent on false advertising to entice suckers instead of on providing communications. The email talks about companies spending money on advertising to attract people instead of really providing good services. I agree entirely. The email went on: We don’t want Telstra’s superannuation and pensions moved into the hands of Transnational financiers. Of course we do not. It continued: We don’t want Telstra Information answered in India or Asia by people who can barely speak English. We don’t want the maintenance tendered out to the lowest bidder who employs migrant workers at bowl of rice prices to do poorest quality work for their ultra rich international financier bosses. We want jobs for Aussie kids. MAIN COMMITTEE We do not want high flier corporate bosses deciding to look after the capital cities with the to hell with the bush mentality. The telephone service should be like penny post-at the lowest cost-with the most efficient systemserving all of the people-no matter how remote. We want it to be run by Australians for Australians. This is the fear, and I think Tony Pitt of Queensland put it pretty well. I must say that since the advent of emails I have been able to ‘listen’ to many more constituents and now often hear some very cogent arguments both in Tasmania and on the mainland. But I want to ensure that these people can continue to have this service at reasonable charge and at a reasonable speed. Since the computer age has come upon us, it has made communications around the world a lot easier, but there are still many areas in Tasmania where the internet or email are so slow that people tend to give up. This means the network is insufficient. It needs a lot of work doing to it to make it even passably useable for many areas. If we are to have a service that allows people to work from home, that allows farmers to keep up to date with their markets, that allows the mining industry to be in touch with mineral prices and even journalists to follow what is happening throughout Australia, we need a high-quality and efficient service. At the moment at times you cannot even check emails without the line dropping out. I despair when I go to a small town along the national highway from me, called Exton, where residents have to put up with Telstra cables exposed to the wind, where farmers cannot access their fields for fear of breaking Telstra cables, and the age of the cables goes back 30 years. Many of the residents sought a solution, perhaps of reburying the cable much deeper and out of the line of the property gateways. They were told they would have to pay for its relocation. That is not particularly useful or particularly fair. They really needed to work a solution to enable a cable renewal that could take greater speeds and have access to broadband, or at least ADSL. But, no, here is a small part of the region that is definitely disadvantaged at the moment and will certainly be written off once Telstra has been disposed of. Another problem relates to the type of marketing that has been occurring in my electorate-including me, I might add. A mail-out was received asking residents of the district to register an interest in order to have broadband installed. Many people responded, only to be told that conditions applied and that only certain areas could access the service. This has caused all sorts of anger in the community. Why bother to advertise specials, deals and new services when there was no possibility of delivering them? At least there should be some explanation within the material that it relates to a very narrow area and only a few people may benefit at this time but, if it goes well, maybe it will be extended. Before Telstra is sold, this government has to make some commitments to country people. They deserve these services. If we are to still remain a clever country of any sort, Telstra needs to be in the hands of the government. 2005 and cognate bills debate. I support maternity payments for adoptive parents. On 28 January this year, at the invitation of Lyn Smith, I attended a parents support group in Park Road, Ferntree Gully. The parents support group was established in May 2004 by Lyn to support the growing number of families who have adopted from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. It also supports those families currently waiting to adopt from China. At the Ferntree Gully parents group, I had the pleasure of meeting Lyn Smith’s daughter, Amanda, who is from the MAIN COMMITTEE",228,Gmhba Is In Geelong We Have A Very High Take Up Level Of Private Health Insurance The
242,Mr Wood (La Trobe) (4.55 P.m.),"I rise to speak in the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004Guangxi province in China. I also met several other parents of adopted children, including Robyn, Tina, Dianne and Geoff, Barbara, Tom and Serena, Margie and Greg, and the children from the playgroup, including Madeleine, Ella, Aixin, Mia and Amanda. It was wonderful to see children who had been through so much so happy and content with their new lives in Australia. It was also very warming to see happy Australian parents, who are so proud of their adopted children. It is amazing what the adoptive parents have gone through to adopt a child from overseas, including a wait of up to two years, and an amazing amount of medical checks, references and forms to fill in. Lyn Smith explained to me that adopting Amanda has cost her approximately $22,000. Another burden under Victorian law requires Lyn to remain at home for 12 months in order to raise Amanda, placing a huge financial strain on Lyn, who is a single parent. This is not the case for birth parents. There is no requirement for leave to be taken on the birth of their child. I admire Lyn’s tenacity and persistence in giving Amanda the same opportunities that we often take for granted in Australia. Why would an Australian go to the expense, and endure the rigorous tests, of adoption? The answer is simple: infertile couples or a single person still want the opportunity to share in the greatest gift of all-that is, life itself-and, accordingly, the ability to care for and raise a child in a country of hope and opportunity, that being Australia. What are the benefits of adopted children? The figures I have here are from the Russian Ministry of Education and clearly outline the benefits. In 2000 there were 700,000 children in orphanages in Russia. Research conducted on 15,000 children who aged out of the orphanage system showed 40 per cent became drug users, 40 per cent committed crimes, 10 per cent tragically committed suicide and another source said that roughly half the girls became prostitutes. If adoption means that a child will have a better life than in their country of birth then, accordingly, I support Australia’s parents adopting overseas children. The entire adoption process can take up to 18 months to two years. Therefore, adoptive parents are not eligible for the $3,000 maternity grant simply because it is near impossible to adopt a child in the period of less than 26 weeks of that child’s birth, which is the current cutoff period to make a maternity payment claim in Australia. This is a payment that has been so beneficial to my electorate of La Trobe-one of the fastest growth corridors in Australia. Adoptive parents have paid a huge financial price to have the privilege of an overseas adoption, and the $3,000 maternity payment would greatly ease the burden of providing a cot, a pram, a high chair, toys, clothing and all other needs to support a young child. We are not talking about a large number of families. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare’s Adoptions Australia 2003-04 report, there were 502 adoptions in the 2003-04 period. Three hundred and seventy of these adoptions were intercountry placements, 30 per cent of the children adopted in 2003-04 were from China, 26 per cent were from South Korea, 12 per cent were from Ethiopia and 11 per cent were from Thailand. China and Australia have a bilateral agreement, signed in December 1999, which allows the adoption process. I strongly encourage that this be extended to other countries. To be a parent is one of the greatest challenges and responsibilities in life. In my former deployment with Victoria Police, I met some shocking parents; if there was a licence for parenting, they would never pass the test. That is why I so strongly support adoptive parents who have passed all tests placed in front of them, and that is why I believe they deserve and should be entitled to the maternity payment. MAIN COMMITTEE Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration (5.00 p.m.)-I wish to make some closing remarks in this second reading debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005. The House has been debating the additional estimates appropriation bills, including this bill, and we have heard from a great many speakers. The bills identify the need for a total of some $2.09 billion, made up of approximately $1.67 billion for expenses and some $421 million for non-operating expenses. In conjunction with the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the 2004-05 additional estimates update the 2004-05 budget. Of course, in a dynamic economy like ours, not all contingencies for a financial year can be accurately forecast in the preceding months. There are several notable examples of such updates in these bills, including $365.1 million for the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in additional funding for Job Network, which reflects the continuation of record levels of performance and employment outcomes under employment services contract No.3; a net $103.8 million for the Department of Defence, which includes $149.9 million to fund accelerated depreciation for the early withdrawal of the F111 fighter planes and two guided missile frigates and $85.1 million in indexation adjustments; and $60.1 million to establish the most excellent National Water Commission and provide program funding under the Australian water fund. The 2004-05 additional estimates play an important part in assisting the government to deliver the programs and economic management which make Australia a prosperous, safe and just society. Since 1996, the Australian economy has experienced a long period of sustained and strong growth. In 2004-05, the economy is forecast to grow by some three per cent. During the period of sustained prosperity for our nation, the unemployment rate has been reduced and inflation and interest rates have been kept low. The official interest rate has fallen from 7.5 per cent in March 1996 to 5.5 per cent today. Employment is forecast to grow by two per cent during 2004-05. Unemployment is at 5.1 per cent, the lowest level since monthly labour market statistics were first collated in February 1978. Since the Howard government came to power, official interest rates have average around 5.3 per cent. This has given enormous confidence to invest in both the commercial and private sector. The government’s fiscal record matches its excellent economic record. The government has reduced net debt by $73 billion to $23.4 billion in 2003-04 and we expect net debt to continue to fall over the forward estimates. By 2006-07, net debt is expected to be negative. This means Australia is among the countries with the lowest government net debt levels in the OECD. For example, as a share of GDP, Australia’s net debt level is well below that of the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and New Zealand. The continuing decline in net debt means that net interest payments have fallen from a peak of $8.4 billion in 1996-97 to $3 billion in 2003-04, providing a greater ability to fund new spending in priority areas such as health and education. Under John Howard, over the seven years to 2003-04 the Australian government’s cumulative underlying cash surpluses have amounted to around $39.1 billion and surpluses are also projected for the forward years to 2007-08. The Howard government’s disciplined fiscal management has helped to maintain investor confidence, as I say, and lower interest rates, which have encouraged this strong and stable economic growth that we have all benefited from. This is despite the extraordinary drought-the worse on record-significant international upheavals MAIN COMMITTEE which affected, in particular, our tourist industry and, of course, strong overseas dollars, which made exporting more difficult. So the economic record of the government remains one of our proudest achievements. Despite the Howard government’s record, however, opposition members in this debate sought to criticise the government’s performance and have proposed an amendment to this bill that refers to interest rates. They claim that the spending commitments made by the government during the election campaign would add to inflation and interest rate pressures; they say that Australia is facing a skills shortage that would lead to inflation and interest rate pressures; and the fourth clause of their amendment states that there is a greater need for long-term policy commitments to improve the productivity and competitiveness of the economy. The opposition really do lack credibility in relation to any proclamation about interest rates, spending beyond our means, upskilling or, indeed, long-term policies. We actually have a problem finding short-term policies from the Labor Party, much less long-term policies. Getting back to interest rates, I would like to remind the House that, under the leadership of our great Treasurer, Peter Costello, home loan mortgage rates have been at their lowest level since the 1960s. The member for Brand stated that interest rates are much lower in a number of other countries, citing the US and Japan. Of course, these countries have faced major economic slowdowns in recent years and this has led their central banks to reduce interest rates to try and stimulate their economies. As these countries have recovered, their interest rates have risen. Australia, in contrast, has been one of the strongest economies in recent years, despite the international roadblocks, and we have not needed to drop interest rates to the very low levels of, say, the US or Japan in order to create monetary stimulus. The members for Brand, Lilley, Hotham and Rankin argue that the government’s election commitments in the 2004 period will put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. Members on this side of the House know that continued strong revenue growth, the result of a healthy economy, is delivering the streams of revenue necessary to fund our new commitments in a responsible manner. The combination of rising real incomes, low inflation and low interest rates is benefiting the financial position, as I said before, of both the private and the public sectors. The coalition’s election initiatives, worth some $8.5 billion in net terms over four years, are in line with the fiscal strategy that has helped achieve these outcomes. Election promises and measures in the 2004-05 budget are consistent with the fiscal strategy which aims for budget balance, on average, over the course of the economic cycle. The fiscal strategy also aims for surpluses as long as growth prospects remain sound. More recently, the projections in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook are for sizeable surpluses over the forward estimates period that can accommodate our subsequent election promises. In the nine budgets of this Howard government, nominal spending has grown by an average of around 4.5 per cent per year and spending as a share of GDP has been trending downwards. By 2003-04 it was 22 per cent of GDP. A number of members, including those for Batman, Jagajaga, Lilley and Rankin, claim that the current level of skills in the economy is leading to inflationary and interest rate pressures. That is really a bit rich. We all remember that what we inherited in 1996 was an extraordinary deficit of people with trade skills. Students preferred to undertake general courses at university rather than apprenticeships. We already had an extraordinary skills deficit, particularly in rural and regional Australia. MAIN COMMITTEE When we came to government, these problems were immediately addressed. The number of the government’s new apprenticeships has increased from 143,700 at that time to almost 400,000 at June 2004, while the number of students undertaking vocational education and training in schools almost doubled between 1997 and 2003 to around 200,000. A number of measures were announced during the election campaign which totalled $1.1 billion over five years as part of ongoing investment in human capital, including the establishment of Australian technical colleges to improve skills in traditional trades. We had to do that, of course, because in states like Victoria the Labor government of the day abolished technical schools, rolled them into high schools, told the high schools that they had to call themselves colleges, sold up the specialist technical school equipment and basically demoralised technical school teachers and those who had chosen to undertake schooling in trades related areas. We are trying to climb back from that terrible time. We also had the provision of trade learning scholarships as an incentive in new apprenticeship and skills shortage industries; the funding of new toolkits for up to 34,000 new apprentices each year; the funding of prevocational training in trades; and, the extension of eligibility for youth allowance and Austudy for those over 25 to new apprentices from July 2005. This funding will be provided in addition to the $2.1 billion the Australian government spends annually on vocational education and training. So yes, we know about the skills deficit-we inherited it. We are doing an enormous amount to overcome these issues. Inflation remains moderate and appears to be well under control. The CPI rose by 0.8 per cent in the December quarter of 2004 and increased by 2.6 per cent throughout the year. A number of members, in particular the member for Lilley, made a number of claims that related to the government’s long-term economic policies. I have already said that that is a little odd when we cannot find short-term economic policies from Labor. The evidence demonstrates that the Howard government’s economic and fiscal strategies have put Australia at the forefront of the developed world. The OECD notes that Australia has become a model for other OECD countries, thanks to our deep structural reforms in virtually all markets creating a deep-seated competition culture and the adoption of fiscal and monetary frameworks and emphasised transparency and accountability and established stability-orientated macro policies independent from political debate. The OECD endorses the government’s ‘pro-growth’ strategy as the appropriate response to the challenges posed by an ageing population and the fiscal pressures in particular on health program costs, and suggests a number of reforms to the labour market, product markets and social policies to encourage more people to join and remain in the work force and to steadily raise their productivity. In addition, the IMF, in its 2004 Article IV Staff Report, is highly complimentary about Australia’s recent performance. The IMF regards Australia’s fiscal policy as fundamentally sound and endorses the government’s medium-term fiscal strategy. It commends Australia’s monetary policy and views the RBA’s current policy stance as appropriate. It commends the government for producing a well-conceived and comprehensive strategy to deal with the pressures rising from the ageing of the population, it supports the structural reforms announced in the 2004-05 budget to promote work force participation productivity growth and it commends the soundness of Australia’s financial system and the commitment to trade liberalisation. So MAIN COMMITTEE the IMF considers that Australia’s pursuit of bilateral free trade agreements is supportive of its efforts in multilateral liberalisation. Given that incredible international endorsement of the government’s economic and fiscal strategies and management, we do not take all that much notice of the opposition who, I am afraid, led us through periods when literally, in areas like mine, you had to sell the family farm because you could not cop the 20-plus per cent interest rates. It led to the most extraordinary hardship and upset and it was with a sigh of relief that we returned this country to the safe hands of the coalition in 1996. During the wide-ranging debate, many members made reference to particular policy areas, as they may-of course, appropriations debates tend to bring on all sorts of contributions from members. I do not have sufficient time to deal with all of the individual matters, but I thank all those who participated in the debate. We want to hear constructive viewpoints and suggestions. Unfortunately, we did not see many of those coming through from the opposition. The member for Blaxland argued that the appropriation bills and the statement of savings were designed to confuse and provide disinformation. The member might be confused but most people are not. I accept that the documents are complex, but they are eminently understandable and transparent. Anyone who cared to review the additional appropriation bills over the last few years would have seen that the format has remained relatively unchanged. I add that these bills are not tabled in isolation. Rather, they are accompanied by portfolio additional estimates statements. These are prepared by the agencies which are seeking the additional funding through the additional appropriation bills. Indeed, the appropriation bills list the portfolio additional estimates statements as relevant documents for statutory interpretation. SoI refer the member for Blaxland to clause 4 of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005. It might help him to gain a better understanding. In relation to infrastructure bottlenecks, the member for Lilley stated that there were capacity constraints in Australia’s rail and port systems. Yes, we know that. That is why our Treasurer has been calling on the states to start being realistic about spending a lot of the extraordinary GST additional revenue streams they have received, in particular in the most recent years, as the economy has grown. We have consolidated the interstate rail network under the Australian Rail Track Corporation. We have done an enormous amount with AusLink-a $12.5 billion initiative to improve the capacity of road and rail infrastructure. Never has a government in the history of Australia put so much emphasis and effort into building infrastructure and unbottling the constraints that we have inherited over time. The national road and rail network has been extended to ports and airports. The government has committed $937 million in additional funding for rail infrastructure alone. There is an extraordinary amount of complexity, yes, and a lot of information, but consistent with the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 the Department of Finance and Administration and the Department of the Treasury undertook formal costings of government and opposition election commitments as requested by either the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition. All election costings were undertaken in accordance with the ‘Costing election commitments guidelines’, which were publicly released on 30 July 2004. All requests for costings received at least five days before the election that did not require further information from either the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition were costed. Those received MAIN COMMITTEE within five days of the election that were able to be costed in the shortened time frame were also costed. So there has never been a government more keen to be transparent and accountable for the commitments it has made-in particular, in making sure those commitments have been properly funded. To best reflect the impact of an election commitment on the Australian government’s budget balance, Finance completed all election costings in a manner consistent with normal budget costing methodologies, despite some members of the opposition claiming otherwise. In conclusion, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005 reinforces the government’s reputation as a magnificent economic manager: for example, the largest item relates to Job Network, and the economy enjoys a very low unemployment rate. Appropriation Bill (No. 3), together with Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2004-2005 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2004-2005, provide funds that are needed in order to maintain government activity and to contribute to the continuing strong performance of the Australian economy.

243,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Quick),"The original question was that this bill be nowCommonwealth Records (Question No. 282) Mr Melham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Arts and Sport, in writing, on 2 December 2004: In respect of each occasion since March 1996 when persons have been granted access to Commonwealth records under the Special Access provisions of the Archives Act 1983 (subsection 56(2) of the Act and Archives Regulation 9), (a) who was granted access, (b) which Commonwealth records were involved, (c) when was access granted, and (d) what was the reason for granting access. honourable member’s question: Section 56(2) of the Archives Act 1983 (the Archives Act) allows the responsible Minister, or a person authorised by the Minister, to grant a person access to Commonwealth records that are not publicly available, in circumstances specified in the regulation 9 of the Archives Regulations and under arrangements approved by the Prime Minister. Arrangements for Special Access were approved in 1988. Information in response to this question is provided in the table below. An answer has not been provided for part (a) of the question, which relates to the names of applicants, for the following reason: Subsection 56(5) of the Archives Act requires the National Archives to provide details of special access requests to the Archives Advisory Council on a regular basis but specifically prohibits the disclosure of names of persons who are special access applicants The Privacy Act 1988 protects personal information about individuals i.e. about natural persons. Information Privacy Principle (IPP) 11 provides that personal information should not be used for a purpose other than that for which it was collected and cannot be disclosed, except under the circumstances specified in IPP 11. For part (b) of the question, responsibility for approving or refusing applications for Special Access rests with the responsible department or agency concerned. The National Archives has administered 48 Special Access requests which were approved by various departments and agencies between March 1996 and December 2004. The requests concern a wide range of Commonwealth records. Provision of more specific information about the Commonwealth records released under the Special Access Arrangements would be a resource intensive activity as the Special Access delegates in all relevant agencies would need to be consulted. The National Archives does not hold information about specific records to which access has been granted. Not uncommonly, access to records less than 30 years of age will be given by the agency to which application was made, on agency premises. Part (c) of the question relating to the approval dates for which Special Access was granted is answered in the table provided at Attachment A. For part (d) of the question, the Special Access Arrangements set out the categories for which Special Access to a record may be granted. Under the Special Access Arrangements, the authorised delegates approve or reject an application for Special Access under section 56(2) of the Archives Act. The National Archives does not hold information on the reason for access decisions. Special Access is a decision for the relevant agency to which application is made. When making decisions on such requests, agencies are guided by Archives Regulation 9 and the Special Access Arrangements approved by the Prime Minister.",237,Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 2 2004 2005

(2) Did he instruct his department prior to 17 October 2004 to engage in talks with Indonesian authorities about the prospect of a security treaty between Australia and Indonesia.
