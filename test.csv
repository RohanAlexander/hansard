PETITIONS Broadcasting and Television Mr DOBIE - ] presenl the following petition: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned showeth: 1. That the Australian people both in Metropolitan and Rural areas should have the best of television programmes available to them and that television as a powerful means of communication should not be in the control of too few hands. 2. The increased quota for Australian dramatic productions should not be imposed by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board at the expense of Australian professional variety or Australian documentary or educational programmes, but directed more towards cutting down expenditure on the purchase of imported productions, thus effecting a considerable saving in Australia's overseas balance of payments. 3. The Australian Parliament has a responsibility to encourage the development of our bility to encourage the development of our National identity, character and heritage and National identity, character and heritage and the promulgation, for the sake of our children, of an adequate picture of Australia, her standards, morals and way of life, particularly petition: standards, morals and way through the media of Radio and Television, through the media of Radio and Television, which is fn the immediate control of the Australian Government. 4. Until constructive and positive action is taken by the Australian Government to promote Australian culture and protect the employment and professional standards of Australian writers, artists and producers in Australia itself tbere is little likelihood of stopping the flow of Australian talent from Australia to other countries. 5. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board must insist that its new quota standards of Australian dramatic content on television are rigidly imposed and enforced on all commercial television stations. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representauves, in Parliament assembled, shouldCause the Australian Government to recognise the right of Australian professional people engaged in the creative and performing arts to further develop their skills and talents in Australia, and to be protected from overseas programmes in a way that will encourage an Australian Television and Radio industry that can reflect and contribute to our identity and growth as a Nation. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.

The humble petition of electors of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. that the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2603 XXIV A (December 1969) declares that the Geneva Protocol of 192S, which Australia has ratified, prohibits the use in international armed conflict of the use in international armed conflict of any chemical agents of warfare-chemica l substances whether gaseous, liquid or solidsubstances whether gaseous, liquid or solidemployed for their direct toxic effects on man, animals or plants; 2. that the World Health Organisation Report (January 1970) confirms the above definition of chemical agents of warfare; 3. that the Australian Government does not accept this definition, but holds that tbe Geneva Protocol does not prevent the use in Geneva Protocol does not prevent the use in war of certain toxic chemical substances in the form of herbicides, defoliants and 'riotcontrol' agents. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray1. tbat the Parliament take note of the consensus of international, political, scientific and humanitarian opinion; and 2. that Honourable Members urge upon the Government the desirability of revising its interpretation of the Geneva Protocol, and declaring that it regards all chemical substances employed for their toxic effects on man, animals or plants as being included in the prohibitions laid down by that Protocol.

Aid to India and East Pakistan Mr REID- I present the following petition: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the welfare of some 9 million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India. Also they are crossed the border into India. Also they are equally concerned about the desperate plight equally concerned about the desperate plight of milhons of displaced persons in East Pakiof milhons of displaced persons in East Pakistan, many of whom are worse off than the refugees, as they are not even receiving relief supplies. The involvement of the Australian supplies. The involvement of the Australian is evidenced by their willingness to contribute substantial funds to voluntary agencies, to assist their work in these countries. 2. As some 20 million refugees and displaced persons are today facing acute problems of hunger and privation-nutritio n and child family problems-ultimat e famine and death on an unprecedented scale-th e Commonwealth Government must plan to come to their assistance in a more sacrificial way. Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that in tackling these great human problems in Bengal, by far the greatest this century, the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, will request that a special meeting of Cabinet to be called to provide $10m for relief purposes in India and East Pakistan, and a further $S0m over three years to help rehabilitate the refugees in East Pakistan. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. Petition received and read.

And that this infringes upon each individual's right as a human being to all available information about contraceptive devices in order to help prevent unwanted pregnancies.

Education Mr JACOBI - I present the following petition: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assemthe House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully shewetiiThat the Commonwealth Parliament has acted to remove some inadequacies in the Australian education system; a major inadequacy at present in Australian education is the lack of equal education opportunity for all; more than 500,000 children suffer from serious lack of equal opportunity: Australia cannot afford to waste the talents of one sixth of its school children; only the Commonwealth has the financial resources for special programmes to remove inadequacies; and nations such as the United Kingdom and the United States have shown that the chief impetus for change and the finance for improvement come from the National Government. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives make legal provision for a joint Commonwealth-State inquiry into inequalities in Australian education to obtain evidence on which to base long term national programmes for the elimination of inequalities; the immediate financing of special programmes for low income earners, migrants, Aboriginal, rural and inner suburban dwellers and handicapped children; and the provision of pre-school opportunities for all children from culturally different or socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that a committee of enquiry, on which are represented the Department of Education and Science, institutions of tertiary education, practising educators, and the Canberra community, be instituted to enquire into the form that an Australian Capital Territory Education Authority should take, the educational principles and philosophy that should underlie it, and its mode of operation and administration.

MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS Mr MCMAHON (Lowe-Prim e Minister)- Mr Speaker, I wish to inform the House that the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Nixon) left Australia on lst October for the United Kingdom and Europe to attend a meeting of the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation. He is expected to return to Australia on 21st October. During his absence the Minister for the Interior ( Mr Hunt) is Acting Minister for Shipping and Transport. RURAL RECONSTRUCTION SCHEME Mr COLLARD- I address a question to the Minister for Labour and National Service. Is it correct that under the proposed rural reconstruction employment training scheme a farm worker cannot qualify unless immediately prior to dismissal he was employed by a farmer who is himself eligible for assistance? If so, will the Minister say why a farm worker's eligibility should be tied to that of his employer, particularly if the worker is dismissed purely because the farmer decides to run the property without help? Is it also correct that irrespective of experience with other farmers, a farm worker to qualify must have at least 12 months continuous service with the employer who actually dismisses him? Does the son of a farmer require only 6 months service to qualify? Will the Minister say why there shouid be differentation, and will he also tell us the talwhy domestics are excluded entirely? Mr LYNCH-Th e honourable gentleand man asked me a series of detailed quesMr James-Ar e you going to shirk answering them? Mr LYNCH- . . . and if it were for not for the mumblings on the other side of Mr James-Tha t is a reflection on the the immediate honourable member. Mr SPEAKER-Order ! The honourable and member for Hunter will restrain himself. Mr LYNCH-I f it had not been for the mumblings on the other side of the ever Chamber I would have heard the detailed questions he posed to me. But basically, as I recall Mr Collard- I will repeat the question. Mr SPEAKER-Order! Did the Minister not hear the question? Does he want it repeated? Mr LYNCH-Yes . ( Mr Collard having repeated his question)Mr LYNCH- I thank the honourable gentleman for repeating the question to the House. The answer to the question which he asks is as follows: Firstly, yes, it is true that a farm hand will qualify under the rural retraining programme only if he has been in the employ of an eligible farmer for a period of 12 months before the date of application. Secondly, I do not interpret the present provisions of the programme as representing any degree of discrimination between rural workers either as between rural workers not themselves farmers, relatives of farmers or domestics who do not qualify under the scheme. The domestics will be catered for under other training programmes which I mentioned in the statement which I brought before the House. I presume that the honourable member is referring to female domestics. He would be aware that, as I made very clear in the House, they come under the women's retraining programme and are fully entitled to the facilities afforded by that programme. In the Government's view there has been no such discrimination as the honourable gentleman implies. UNIVERSITY STUDENTS Mr JARMAN- I ask the Minister for Education and Science: What are the powers and responsibilities of university authorities to prevent university property being used as a sanctuary for those against whom warrants for arrest have been issued by the courts? In the case of the 8 suspended students at La Trobe University what is the position of the Commonwealth in respect of any Commonwealth scholarship which a suspended student may hold? Mr MALCOLM FRASER- 1 shall answer the last part of the honourable member's question first. Of the 8 students who were suspended from La Trobe University none had Commonwealth scholarships benefits at the time of their suspension or at the time of the incident which led to their suspension. Four of them previously had had Commonwealth scholarships. Three of those had lost their scholarships completely because of failure to make academic progress, and as a matter of normal administration their scholarships were withdrawn or suspended. One other student had had his scholarship under suspension, again because of failure to make academic progress. There was a somewhat similar case earlier, involving fewer people, at Monash University. The three people there involved also had their scholarships withdrawn because of failure to make academic progress which, in part, can flow from a decision to suspend a student from a university, because under a suspension he cannot make progress. That is the normal operation of the Commonwealth scholarship system. Those three students either had had their scholarships withdrawn or were suspended likewise because of failure to make academic progress. Discipline In a State university is a responsibility of the university or, if the matter is beyond the competence of the university, the responsibility is for the normal law enforcement agencies of the police. It is recognised that universities are imports; and control over capital movepolice. It is recognised that universities not and cannot be sanctuaries. That point was made by Professor Willett, the Chairman of the Professorial Board of the University of Melbourne in a letter published this morning. The particular draft resistors who were present in the union of the University of Melbourne were known to be number of cables from my colleague, the University of Melbourne were known to there. I am advised that in the daytime there were no barricades or inhibitions. They were just present. There was nothing to prevent the police acting at the time at which the police thought it appropriate to act. If the students had been barricaded in university premises or in union premises there would have been a duty on the responsible authorities in the university, if they could not manage the matter themselves, to call upon the police to deal with that kind of situation. So far as the union is concerned, the prerogative of responsibility rests in a board of directors of the union, which is separate from the university administration. Honourable members may be interested to know that the union board had written to the Students' Representative Council and, I understand, also to some students saying that, whatever students and draft resistors might be there at night, they should not be there. It is my understanding that the board of directors had not had time to act upon that letter but the letter had in fact been written. Therefore, 1 think it is an example of the board of directors of the union meeting its responsibilities. May I repeat one point. If people were barricaded within university premises and the university authorities themselves felt that they could not deal with that situation, I would regard it as the university's responsibility or, in the case of the union, the responsibility of the board of directors to ask for police assistance. INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND Mr CREAN- I desire to address a question to the Prime Minister. Did Australia at the recent meetings of the International Monetary Fund indicate any firm view on the following matters: Expansion in the amount of special drawing rights and their allocation; variations in the price of gold; the floating of the Australian exchange rate, either managed or freely determined, sometimes described as dirty or clean; the removal of the surcharges on American are imports; and control over capital movements? In particular, have discussions taken place separately with Japan as to future trading terms with that country and the determination of exchange rates as between the yen and the Australian dollar? Mr MCMAHON- I have received a be number of cables from my colleague, the Treasurer, as to what he has been doing during his recent visit to the International terms of other matters, the Soviet Union during his recent visit to the International Monetary Fund meeting and also as to the private conversations he has been having with representatives of the United Stales Government and other governments. I also had a telephone conversation with him last night informing me of what proposals he had made. I feel it is proper in a matter like this that we should wait until the Treasurer himself returns, when he can make a report to the Parliament, and if necessary that report can be debated in this place. I think it would be imprudent, even bordering on being unwise, for me to try to mention some of the matters that have been discussed by the Treasurer. I think it is better that the whole picture be presented by him. NAVAL STRENGTHS Mr BURY-Ca n the Minister for the Navy give the House some indication of the very serious recent decline in the naval honourable members, are relatively close to the very serious recent decline in the naval strength and sea power of the United States compared with that of the Soviet Union? Can he say whether there has been any substantial recent increase in Soviet naval activity and operations in the Indian Ocean? Dr MACKAY- I am sure that members of the House are interested to know the comparative strengths of the great nations of the world and their sea power. The last edition of 'Janes Fighting Ships', which is perhaps the most authoritative summary of this situation, has recently arrived in Aus- other high commissions in London but also this situation, has recently arrived in Australia. The foreword to that edition points out things which I feel every honourable member should be concerned to hear. It can be summarised in this way: At the present moment the editors of 'Janes' and their advisers consider that, in every department other than aircraft carriers, the United States is steadily-indeed , to quote the Chief of Naval Operations of the United States, alarmingly-fallin g behind the strength of the Union of Soviet Socialits Republics. The USSR has 3 times as many submarines as does the United States. The USSR is building nuclear submarines at the rate of one a month. I would remind honourable members that the cost of one nuclear submarine at the present moment, even if Australia could obtain one, is far beyond our wildest consideration. Moreover, in terms of other matters, the Soviet Union has been equipping its ships with surface to surface missiles. More than 270 of its ships are now so equipped. The United States has no ships equipped with the anti-surfacevessel missile. As I said the other day, we in Australia, in designing our new destroyer, are currently thinking in terms of a capacity to deal with this kind of threat and to operate in this environment. But it is indeed something that we all should ponder as we consider the reason behind this enormous growth. 'Janes' says: By any standards the Soviet Navy is now the super navy of a super power. To administer what it considers to be its world charter the USSR has for some time had a task force in the Indian Ocean and more recently in the environment of the Philippines there have been activities of another Russian task force. These areas, I would remind honourable members, are relatively close to our own shores and of significance to us in terms of naval defence. HIGH COMMISSION IN LONDON Mr WHITLAM- I address a question to the Prime Minister. What is the reason for the delay in announcing the decision to transfer ministerial responsibility for Australia House in London from the Prime Minister to the Foreign Minister? Is it not appropriate to proceed with this decision, not only to accord with the position of all other high commissions in London but also in view of the change in status of Australian citizens in Britain and the change in trade relations between Australia and Britain both of which changes were made against views expressed by the Government? Mr MCMAHON-Whe n I was Minister for Foreign Affairs I considered whether Australia House should be transferred from Prime Ministerial control to the control of the Foreign Office. The honourable gentleman will remember that on one occasion I discussed this with him. On that occasion he did not favour it, or at least he did not appear to favour it very strongly. I have continued to give this matter quite close consideration. I do not think at the moment that any marked advantage would be obtained from such a change. But in any event I would not be prepared to agree to change or to direct that a change be made proceed. 1 cannot indicate the length of change or to direct that a change be made until I had discussed it with the British time that the Governments will take to until I had discussed it with the British Prime Minister and had also obtained the consider the matter. Prime Minister and had also views of Buckingham Palace. DARTMOUTH DAM Mr LLOYD- I direct a question to the individual Acts have been proclaimed by Mr LLOYD- I direct a question to the Minister for National Development. Has each member government. Honourable Minister for National Development. the Minister's attention been drawn to a members will understand that the matter is the Minister's attention been drawn to question and answer concerning the cost of only being considered now because at last question and answer concerning the cost the proposed Dartmouth Reservoir on page the South Australian Government has the proposed Dartmouth Reservoir on 721 of Victoria Parliamentary DebatesHansard of Wednesday, 29th September delayed for some considerable time. The Hansard of Wednesday, 29th September 1971? The Honourable S. R. MCDonald, a proclamation of the Act by the various 1971? The Honourable S. R.

After that, they will have the ince in the Legislative Council, asked whether the review of the construction cost opportunity of considering the new estiwhether the review of the construction cost of Dartmouth had been completed, and if mates. I can assure the honourable memof Dartmouth had been completed, and so, what was the original estimate and ber that, from my own point of view as so, what was the original estimate and what was the new estimate. Does the president of the River Murray Commission what was the new estimate. Does the Minister agree with the answer provided to and also in my capacity in this GovernMinister agree with the answer provided that question by the Minister for State ment, I have every desire to see this matter that question by the Minister for State Development on behalf of the Minister for considered as quickly as possible. Development on behalf of the Minister Water Supply that the original estimate was $57.5m and the new estimate is $64m? If this latest figure is correct, can the Minister say when a decision will he made on the construction of Dartmouth as this the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minison the construction of Dartmouth as this figure is marginally above the 10 per cent ter realise that for each I million sheep figure is marginally above the 10 per cent proviso in the escalation clause of the origshorn huge pastoral companies will benefit proviso in the escalation clause of the origshorn inal agreement? Mr SWARTZ- 1 have not had the to an improved scheme for the benefit of Mr SWARTZ- 1 have not had the to opportunity to see the question and answer small wool growers relieving them of the opportunity to see the question and answer to which the honourable member has need to repay immediately their debt to huge to which the honourable member has need referred but I can confirm that the ngures pastoral money lenders, banks, etc.? I further referred but I can confirm that the ngures that have been quoted are accurate-tha t ask: Will firms such as British Tobacco Co. that have been quoted are accurate-tha t is, the latest estimate which has been (Aust.) Ltd benefit from the wool subsidy is, the latest estimate which has been obtained at the request of the River Murplan? Is the Prime Minister in accord with a obtained at the request of the River Murplan? ray Commission by the Snowy Mountains recent statement by his Deputy Prime Minisray Commission by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation is now $64m ter that an early election will be held in the Engineering Corporation is now $64m ter compared with the original estimate of first half of 1972? Finally, I ask: Is the Prime compared with the original estimate of first $57.5m. This does mean under the agreeMinister aware that over Sim has been paid $57.5m. This does mean under the agreeMinister ment that the matter will now be considinto Country Party funds by huge pastoral ment that the matter will now be considinto ered by the River Murray Commission at interests in the last 2 weeks or 3 weeks? ered by the River Murray Commission at its next meeting which is to be held on the 19th of this month. The matter will have to be referred to the various member governments concerned-th e Commonwealth, an election should be held on the grounds ments concerned-th e Commonwealth, an New South Wales, Victorian and South of donations to Country Party funds? New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian Governments-fo r consideration because the agreement states specifically that if the estimate is above the increase of of 10 per cent allowed the matter must be funds. I hope that the honourable member 10 per cent allowed the matter must be referred to those Governments for reconwill put me in touch with .the respective referred to those Governments for reconwill sideration. Under the agreement they then gentleman sideration. Under the agreement they then gentleman have 6 months to decide whether they will proceed. 1 cannot indicate the length of time that the Governments will take to obtained the consider the matter. There is just one other point and that is that this matter cannot yet be considered by any government when it is referred to it by the River Murray Commission until the individual Acts have been proclaimed by Has each member government. Honourable a members will understand that the matter is of only being considered now because at last page the South Australian Government has ratified the original agreement, which it delayed for some considerable time. The a proclamation of the Act by the various should take a matter of a few weeks only. After that, they will have the opportunity of considering the new estiif mates. I can assure the honourable member that, from my own point of view as president of the River Murray Commission to and also in my capacity in this Government, I have every desire to see this matter for considered as quickly as possible. WOOL Mr FOSTER- I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister realise that for each I million sheep huge pastoral companies will benefit from the guaranteed wool price plan by at least 8600,000? Will he sive consideration an improved scheme for the benefit of small wool growers relieving them of the to repay immediately their debt to huge pastoral money lenders, banks, etc.? I further ask: Will firms such as British Tobacco Co. (Aust.) Ltd benefit from the wool subsidy Is the Prime Minister in accord with a recent statement by his Deputy Prime Ministhat an early election will be held in the half of 1972? Finally, I ask: Is the Prime aware that over Sim has been paid Country Party funds by huge pastoral interests in the last 2 weeks or 3 weeks? Mr SPEAKER-Order! Mr FOSTER-Doe s he agree that such election should be held on the grounds of donations to Country Party funds? Mr SINCLAIR- I am delighted to hear these contributions to Country Party funds. I hope that the honourable member put me in touch with .the respective Mr Anthony-An d me, too. Mr SINCLAIR-An d my leader as well, because neither of us knows anything about them. As to the first part of the question, it follows in typical grandiose form the idea that it would be possible to distinguish between individual wool growers. As the honourable member should know, at the time when the $30m was allocated in the last Budget in order to help wool growers, considerable difficulty was found in trying to determine whether or not assistance could be provided to all those who apply. In many instances, individual growers who might well have taken action on their own part to try to minimise the impact of the disastrous fall in wool prices were excluded from help from the scheme simply because of the criteria of eligibility. It was with that in mind that the Government considered quite closely when it introduced the current wool price support scheme the question of who should be entitled to receive payment. I do not know whether or not the figures $10m to help to alleviate the plight of I do not know whether or not the figures which the honourable gentleman has prothese impoverished people? which the honourable gentleman duced in the House have been calculated by anybody other than himself. It is true that the level of assistance depends entirely on speeches in this House and from discussions the level of assistance depends entirely the price paid each week at auction for the I have had with the honourable gentleman the price paid each week at auction for various types of eligible wools which are I have a recognition of his very sincere various types of eligible wools which are sold. Therefore, it is not possible to deterconcern at the critical position of refugees sold. Therefore, it is not possible to deterconcern mine how much money will be paid to each not only by the Australian Government but, mine how much money will be paid to each woo] grower at what time. The amount is I believe, by all Australians. I am told that woo] grower at what time. The amount is determined week by week and the percenta number of people apparently are engaged determined week by week and the percenta age is determined in relation to a schedule in some form of public display in front of age is determined in relation to a schedule brought down by the Australian Wool this House today. I was interested in this brought down by the Australian Wool this Commission and the difference determined regard in an observation made a few weeks Commission and the difference determined in relation to the week's average sale. The ago by the Premier of Queensland when in relation to the week's average sale. honourable gentleman is suggesting that talking about the difliculties which he and honourable gentleman is suggesting that classes of eligibility should be established. his Government face in recruiting sufficient classes of eligibility should be established. I do not believe that classes of eligibility people to work in the field of welfare for I do not believe that classes of eligibility would be in the best interests of either Aborigines. It has often seemed to me that would be in the best interests of either individual wool growers or the wool those who demonstrate, whatever the form individual wool growers or the wool industry as a whole. For that reason, the of demonstration, might well look to more industry as a whole. For that reason, the scheme is framed and will operate oc the beneficial and fruitful form in displaying scheme is framed and will operate oc the basis that I announced in this House some their concern than simply to seek publicity, basis that I announced in this House some weeks ago. Mr Foster- I rise to take a point of from statements made in this House that Mr Foster- I rise to take a point order. I had directed my question to the the Government has provided a range of order.

EAST PAKISTAN Mr REID-I s the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs aware that 3 men, Paul Poernomo, Steve Rooney and Geoff Evans, have commenced a fast outside Parliament House? Their aim is to highlight the desperate plight of some 9 million East Pakistan refugees in India and millions of displaced persons in East Pakistan, most of whom face famine conditions and ultimate death unless large scale assistance is provided by foreign governments. Will the Minister inform the House whether the Commonwealth Government is prepared to make a more sacrificial contribution of $10m to help to alleviate the plight of has prothese impoverished people? Mr SINCLAIR-Havin g listened to his on speeches in this House and from discussions the I have had with the honourable gentleman I have a recognition of his very sincere at the critical position of refugees from East Pakistan. This concern is shared not only by the Australian Government but, I believe, by all Australians. I am told that number of people apparently are engaged in some form of public display in front of House today. I was interested in this regard in an observation made a few weeks The ago by the Premier of Queensland when talking about the difliculties which he and his Government face in recruiting sufficient people to work in the field of welfare for Aborigines. It has often seemed to me that those who demonstrate, whatever the form of demonstration, might well look to more beneficial and fruitful form in displaying their concern than simply to seek publicity, whatever the form of search might be. However, honourable members are aware of from statements made in this House that the the Government has provided a range of assistance to help to overcome the disastrous circumstances facing East Pakistani both in India and Pakistan. I hope today to make a further statement in this regard. I can assure the honourable member and the House that it in no way relates to any action that has been taken here or anywhere else by those who seem to me to be more publicity seekers than people genuinely engaged in the search for a solution to the problem.

I suggest that is the honourable member ask his question. Dr KLUGMAN-N o doubt the Minister is aware that 40 Aboriginal children suffering with meningococcal meningitis have been admitted to Alice Springs Hospital during the last 6 weeks and that 20 of these children are now is in that hospital. This compares with the 13 cases in the rest of Australia dura similar period. Is it a fact that three of of the most recent cases are from Naggerbee Station which has an Aboriginal population of 120, of which 20 are children? Is it also a fact thai the well there is almost dry, order to purchase land in the Simpson also a fact thai the well there is almost the water is rationed for drinking only and the weU will be completely dry in another 2 weeks? Is a government fire-fighting tanker used to cart salt water to keep the lawns alive but is not made available to cart fresh water? The question that is being asked by people at the station is: Is the government Owned drilling rig available this week but not to be used because of a dispute on the question of responsibility between the Government and station management? Will the Minister take urgent steps to rectify this situation inasmuch as it is in his power to do so? Mr HUNT- I am aware of the serious the Northern Territory Administration conMr HUNT- I am aware of the serious health problem confronting Aboriginal siders that the pastoral lease areas adjacent health problem confronting Aboriginal siders children in the Northern Territory, particuto the Simpson Desert area are very children in the Northern Territory, particuto larly at Alice Springs, and I have had dismarginal indeed. larly at Alice Springs, and I have had dismarginal indeed. cussions with my colleague, the Minister for Health, in regard to this matter.

SIMPSON DESERT Mr CORBETT- 1 ask the Minister for 2,500 square miles of this area. The portion Mr CORBETT- 1 ask the Minister for the Interior whether he is still receiving of the Simpson Desert in South Australia the Interior whether he is still receiving money and requests from the general public is also a national park and I think it money and requests from the general public for the purchase of land in the Simpson occupies an area of about 1900 square for the purchase of land in the Simpson Desert in the Northern Territory.

If the Iand is not for sale member for Capricornia. Indeed, I received land is for sale? If the Iand is not for sale how can he respond to the suggestion of a letter today, Mr Speaker, and if it is in how can he respond to the suggestion of the honourable member for Capricornia order for me to read it, I should like to do the honourable member for Capricornia order that he should transfer these funds to the so. hdnourable member who would devote them to a public company he hopes to form for the purpose of purchasing this land? Mr SPEAKER-Order ! If 1 heard the last part of the question correctly, it is out of order. The Minister has no control over the personal activities of the honourable member for Capricornia and I suggest that he answer thefirstpart of the question only. Mr HUNT-I n reply to the honourable Desert. The letter states: Mr HUNT-I n reply to the honourable member for Maranoa, it is true to say that I am still receiving a great number of comprisesThe land, with an area of 1,600 square rniles, I am still receiving a great number of comprisesThe letters from people.

However, I want to make it perfectly clear once again that the land in the Northern Territory portion of the Simpson Desert is not for sale, nor is it likely to be for sale in the future. Officers of my Department were in touch with the Northern Territory Administration Lands and Survey Branch in Darwin last week and were told that no approaches had been made to it by American or other interests for parcels of land in the Northern Territory sector of the Simpson Desert. I repeat that neither the Government nor the Administration has any plans whatsoever to offer pastoral leases in this area. Moreover, the Northern Territory Administration conthat the pastoral lease areas adjacent the Simpson Desert area are very The question asked by the honourable member for Maranoa, in fact, arises from a question asked by the honourable member my for Capricornia who, I have no doubt, was confused by a reported negotiation that was contemplated with an American buyer for leases in Queensland many miles north of the Simpson Desert. The Simpson Desert in Queensland is reserved as a national park and there are, I think, about 2,500 square miles of this area. The portion of the Simpson Desert in South Australia is also a national park and I think it occupies an area of about 1900 square miles. This whole Simpson Desert business has been based on a false premise which rise to the hopes of the honourable member for Capricornia. Indeed, I received a letter today, Mr Speaker, and if it is in for me to read it, I should like to do Mr SPEAKER-I t looks to me to be rather long. Mr HUNT- I shall abbreviate it by reading only a section of it. It is from a fellow named Mr Griffin, who is an estate agent in the area of Townsville. Mr Griffin has written to apologise and to explain in detail the true position concerning a large area of land in the vicinity of the Simpson Desert. The letter states: land, with an area of 1,600 square rniles, 3 pastoral leases known as 'Yuluma'. 'Gungur' and 'Buruli', situated north of the Mr SPEAKER-Order ! I hope that the Minister will comply with my request and not read the entire letter. Mr HUNT - I should like to table it to put the record straight. Mr SPEAKER- I would suggest that the Minister seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard. Mr HUNT-Ver y well, Mr Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate this letter in the remainder of the Minister's reply is seek leave to incorporate this letter Hansard. Mr SPEAKER-I s leave granted? There after question time. Mr SPEAKER-I s leave granted? being no objection, leave is granted. Mr HUNT - I thank honourable memSpeaker, I am concluding Mr HUNT - I thank honourable bers. The letter is as follows: Dear Mr Minister, 1 write to apologise, and to explain in detail, money or returning it to those people? 1 write to apologise, and to explain in the true and correct situation concerning a large the true and correct situation concerning a large area of land in the vicinity of the Simpson Desert, Central Australia. The land, with an area of 1,600 square miles, The land, with an area of 1,600 square miles, comprises three (3) pastoral leases known ns 'Yuluma', 'Gungur' and 'Buruli', situated north of the National Park. These leases were allotted lo Boulia Land Court on Sth August 1964, and the present lessee wishes to sell, because he has not present lessee wishes to sell, because he has not sufficient capital to develop the properties, and he is in arrears with rates and rental. We have an American client who is seeking a large area of land, similar-to this, at a reasonable large area of land, similar-to this, at a reasonable price, which could be developed. Discussions have been taking place for some time, and we are presently awaiting advice from the Lands Department in Brisbane concerning the conditions attached to these leases. In the meantime, the ABC Townsville heard of the negotiations and approached me. I confirmed that our client was interested in acquiring a large area of land in the region of the Simpson Desert, and subject to the term of the leases and the conditions, and subject to the approval of the the conditions, and subject to the approval of the Lands Commission, our client could well be interested in negotiating to purchase. The day after the announcement, the 'Australian' newspaper on Saturday, 18th September, without any reference to me, seized the opportunity to make spectacular headlines by saying the Simpson make spectacular headlines by saying the Simpson Desert was for sale at 20c per acre. I did not take any action then, as I considered the announcement as most ridiculous. I became seriously concerned when afterringingme on Wednesday, 22nd September for a story, and I told the reporter I had nothing to report, then on the 23rd September they blatantly quoted mc as having said that the Simpson Desert was sold. I assure the honourable member for that in New South Wales every housing I assure the honourable member for Maranoa that the land is not for sale and commission rental will increase by $1 a Maranoa that the land is not for sale good Australians, with an admirable desire week? Is it a fact that the much vaunted good Australians, with an admirable desire to maintain Australia's heritage-a n objecgrants scheme represents only a very minor to maintain Australia's heritage-a n objecgrants tive which this Government supportswere unfortunately misled by the honourable member for Capricornia when he invited people to send me 25c for every acre they wished to purchase. Mr SPEAKER-Order ! Has the Minister a great deal more to say? Mr HUNT-No t a great deal, Mr Speaker. Mr SPEAKER- I would suggest that if in the remainder of the Minister's reply is lengthy, he seek leave to make a statement There after question time. Mr HUNT-Wit h due respect, Mr memSpeaker, I am concluding Mr Cope-O n a point of order, Mr Speaker, is the Minister sticking to the detail, money or returning it to those people? Mr HUNT- I am coming to that very good point. Mr SPEAKER-Order ! I again point out to the Minister that this is question time. His answer has been rather lengthy and although it may be interesting I would suggest that, unless the Minister can conclude his remarks now, he make a statement after question time. Mr HUNT- I should like to make it perfectly clear to the honourable member for Maranoa and to the House that I have arranged, by adding staff to my office, to return all moneys to the unfortunate people who have been inconvenienced by an exercise in political irresponsibility which has caused frustration and a great waste of public funds. I will not be transferring the money, including the $25 that the Leader of the Opposition handed to me on behalf of someone else, to the honourable member for Capricornia, who is forming a company. HOUSING Mr LIONEL BOWEN- I direct my question to the Minister for Housing and I refer to the recent Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement in which the interest rate was increased from 6 per oent to 7 per cent. Does this 1 per cent increase mean that in New South Wales every housing and commission rental will increase by $1 a week? Is it a fact that the much vaunted scheme represents only a very minor proportion of the loss that each State government bears in the rental rebate system? For example, the loss suffered by New South Wales last year was $1.6m on 6 per cent interest. Why has the Government forced up the rents of the lowest income earners and will the Government now increase the grant to cover the whole of the losses incurred by the States on the rental rebate system? Mr KEVIN CAIRNS-Th e proposed new housing arrangements for the Commonwealth and the States propose to eliminate the interest concession of 1 per cent below the long term bond rate on borrowings for State housing but propose to do much more than substitute for this concession by way of a very significant increase in grants. The increases in grants are such that on a number of calculations the interest concession which would apply now on housing has been increased by something like SO per cent at least. In addition to this, sinking fund contribution's will be made by the Commonwealth with respect to the new scheme which could enable further interest concession to apply for the advances for State housing. This being the background to the new agreement, it is quite clear that these arrangements could in no way be responsible for any significant increase in rents. Especially this would be so as the Commonwealth proposes to make specific new rental assistance grants which have not applied in the past and which are to help the States in some of their rental rebate arrangements. Overall it is quite clear that if State authorities intend either to increase tion in the duty on the raw materials. I do if State authorities intend either to increase rents or increase the prices asked from those who are purchasing houses from State housing authorities, this scheme and this assistance would not be responsible for such increases. They would be due to decisions made by State authorities for other reasons. WOOL Mr KELLY- I address my question to the Minister for Trade and Industry. Has the Minister heard of the development of rugging sheep with plastic rugs to improve the quality of the fleece by protecting it from the action of weather and from vegetable fault, particularly in areas suitable only for wool production? Is the Minister aware that the cost of these plastic rugs is increased by a very signincant degree by the effect of tbe tariff on imported plastic powders and/or the tariff on imported plastic sheets from which the rugs are made? Will the Minister examine the operations of the drawback system to see whether the cost of the tariff can be lessened to allow the wool so protected to be exported on equal terms with wool produced in other countries which do not have to carry this extra tariff burden? Finally, is the Minister aware that the old jumbuck is quite happy to carry the weight of the rug but is unhappy about carrying the weight of the tariff burden also? Mr ANTHONY- I am aware that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has been doing work on plastic coats for sheep to protect their fleeces in difficult weather situations. However. I am not sure of the commercial value of this work or whether it has yet been proved that there is any advantage at all in this operation. I am not sure how recent tariff duties on plastic apply to the plastic sheeting referred to by the honourable member. However, I do know that the recommendations in the Tariff Board report recently tabled in Parliament did mean a reduction in duty in respect of quite a number of plastic items. There may not have been any reduction in duty in the raw chemical plastic materials area because it has not yet been reviewed by the Tariff Board, but it was suggested in the Tariff Board's report that when this area is reviewed, in association with a report on chemicals, possibly there might be a reduction in the duty on the raw materials. I do not know what significance the present duty on plastic materials has on this sheeting, but I do know that in the banana industry plastic sheeting has been used for a long time to protect bunches of bananas, and in my close association with the industry I have never heard the complaint that tariff duty on plastic materials was a significant factor. PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS Mr HAYDEN (Oxley)- Mr Speaker, 1 wish to make a personal explanation. Mr SPEAKER-Doe s the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented by the matter about which he has spoken to me? Mr HAYDEN-Yes , I claim to have been misrepresented by an article which appeared in the 'Daily Mirror' of 29th ultimo. I t is headed 'Labour Favors 2Child Family'. It misquotes some things which I said in response to an interview on the telephone and it misrepresents Labor Party policy. It states: Mr Hayden said Labor Party policy, approved at the last Federal conference in Launceston, favoured wider availability of contraceptives and abortion on demand. I did not say that the Labor Party policy is for abortion on demand; it is not. In relation to those 2 points I quote the policy from the latest publication entitled 'Australian Labor Party Platform, Constitution and Rules'. At page 46, under the heading 'Pharmaceutical Benefits', it states: That contraceptives, when prescribed by a doctor, be available on the free list of pharmaceutical benefits. At page 42, under the heading 'Abortion Law Reform' it states: This Conference recommends that the Party and its various groups such as the Parliamentary Parhim about the sale of land in the Simpson its various groups such as the Parliamentary ties should take a non-party attitude and vote according to their conscience on the issue of abortion law reform. I specifically explained the point of conscience in this matter to the interviewer. Lastly, as I have mentioned, the newspaper article is headed 'Labor Favors 2-Child Family'. The Labor Party has no such policy. I specifically stressed this to the interviewer and indicated that any views which I personally may express on this matter were strictly personal views and would not in any way commit the Party. Mr WHITLA M (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)-I t may be that the Prime Minister ( Mr MCMahon) misrepresented or misunderstood me. I wish to explain Mr SPEAKER-Doe s the Leader of the Opposition wish to make a personal explanation? Mr WHITLAM-Yes . In answer to a question about transferring the ministerial responsibility for our High Commission in London from the Prime Minister to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I think the right honourable gentleman referred to the fact that when he discussed it with me I was not in favour of it or was not very interested. I would not want him or other honourable members to have such an impression. I have advocated this for quite some time. In fact, looking at Hansard of 22nd May 1969, in a question without notice to the former Prime Minister, one can see that my attitude was quite plain. Also, it was plain from the written answer which that right honourable gentleman gave me to a question which I put on notice for him on 13th March 1968 and which he answered on 22nd May 1969. Since the Prime Minister referred to the British Government and Her Majesty, I should like them also to know that I support the change. Dr EVERINGHAM (Capricornia)-M r Speaker, I claim to have been misrepresented today in the reply by the Minister for the Interior ( Mr Hunt). Mr SPEAKER-Doe s the honourable member wish to make a personal explanation? Dr EVERINGHAM-Yes . The Minister claimed that 1 had showed political irresponsibility in asking people to protest to Parhim about the sale of land in the Simpson Desert. In the course of his reply he stated that the part of the Simpson Desert in Queensland is reserved as a national park. The national park in the Simpson Desert in Queensland has rectangular boundaries running east-west and north-south. It does not comprise the whole of the Simpson Desert. The Minister in his reply today and in the letter which he has tabled has admitted that the land for sale is in the vicinity of the Simpson Desert, which was contrary to his earlier statements in this regard. AUSTRALIAN WOOL BOARD Mr SINCLAIR (New England-Ministe r for Primary Industry)-Fo r the information of honourable members I present the interim annual report on the activities of the Australian Wool Board for the year ended 30th June 1971.

The Commonwealth continues to support, through the existing matching grant arrangements, the development of universities and colleges of advanced education. Grants to the States for their universities will increase by 20 per cent and will total $90m, compared with $75m last year. Expenditure on the Australian National University will increase from $32m to $35m. The Commonwealth, of course, has the sole responsibility for financing tertiary institutions in the Australian Capital Territory. These increases in university expenditure are due partly to normal growth, but there is an addidonal element. The Government is willing to join with the States in providing funds for universities and colleges of advanced education during the period to December 1972 to assist them in meeting increases in costs arising from substantial salary and wage increases for non-academic staff which have flowed from 1967-48 1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 1971-72 (est.) 39,912 43,534 50,436 58,877 67,863 16,329 19,097 17,233 16,347 22.167 56,241- 62.631- 67,669- 75.224- 90,030 5,273 6,282 10,658 15,743 19,182 6,647 8,080 9,486 14,837 18,574 11,920- 14,362- 20,144- 30,580- 37,756 12,587 11,762 12,898 13.062 10.824 13,877 7,587 9,878 12.535 9,217 4,518 6,322 13,160 2,470 13,040 1,703 7,540 13,257 9,500 170 309 856 1,165 3,154 2.879 3,446 4.170 4,346 163 231 274 347 680 678 810 867 843- 909- 1,084 1,214 12,177 24,253 24,300 102,297 108,259 148,130 177,491 201,392 82 1,673 2.490 27 172 120 109- 1,845- 2,610 2,899 3,588 4,526 5,209 5,982 16,268 18,160 22,519 25,800 754 1,001 1,628 2,793 3,657 12 200 6,558 6,739 6,791 7,000 1,031 1,124 1,162 - 24,541-- - 28,539- 32,215- 38,420- 43,704 2,720 3,154 3,203 3,407 3,626 522 2,201 3,300 62 190 326 550 903 953 1,017 1.038 1,110 28,164 32,708 37,147 45,392 52,290 176,588 192,597 249,453 302,447 345,534 (a) Excluding Papua New Guinea. authorities, expressed in national accounting terms, No. 9), published by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census a number of awards. The Government has agreed that these increases represent an exceptional circumstance which the universities and colleges could not be expected to meet entirely out of their existing triennial allocation of funds. The additional Commonwealth contribution for universities in the States to meet these increases during the balance of the triennium will be about $5.4m. I should emphasise that while making this offer of supplementary recurrent grants the Government continues to endorse the triennial principle for grants to universities and colleges of advanced education. Although it has agreed to make supplementary payments in the present exceptional circumstances, this action is without prejudice for the future. Grants to the States for their colleges of advanced education are expected to total $38m, an increase of 23 per cent over last year's expenditure of $31m. Expenditure on the Canberra College of Advanced Education will increase from $5m to $5.7m. As in the case of universities, these increases reflect the combined effects of normal growth and the Government's willingness to join with the States during the balance of this triennium in providing funds to assist the colleges in meeting the cost of non-academic salary and wage increases. The additional Commonwealth allocation for the colleges in the States during the balance of the triennium is over $700,000. The Government is again applying the same principle to the Canberra College of Advanced Education and to the Australian National University. I remind the House that the substantial growth in the area of colleges of advanced education is due directly to Commonwealth initiatives in firstly establishing the Committee of Inquiry cation courses in universities and colleges firstly establishing the Committee of Inquiry into Tertiary Education and in providing, with the States, substantial funds to carry out the Committee's major recommendations. The quality and potential of the colleges has been advanced by two further Commonwealth initiatives, again in co-operation with the States-th e Wiltshire inquiry into the nomenclature of awards and the Sweeney inquiry into the basis of salaries for academic staff in the colleges. The Commonwealth's contribution to the Commonwealth initiatives after consultaThe Commonwealth's contribution to the capital cost of teacher training, under the tion with State Ministers. capital cost of teacher training, State Grants (Teachers Colleges) Act, will continue. We estimate that $13m will be spent under this programme during this in, and sole responsibility for, the provispent under this programme during this year.

The Comour appreciation, after consultation with State Ministers, that the existing facilities monwealth is taking this initiative at the State Ministers, that the existing facilities available for the training of teachers would Canberra College of Advanced Education. available for the training of teachers would be insufficient to meet future demand. The Here the training of teachers takes place be insufficient to meet future demand. The effect of this expenditure, together with the alongside the training of young people for effect of this expenditure, together with $24m provided for the same purpose in other professions. The teacher trainee is $24m provided for the same purpose in the triennium ending in June 1970, will be thus able to establish and maintain contact the triennium ending in June 1970, will be to enable some 12,000 places to be built with other professional groups. The basic to enable some 12,000 places to be built for teacher trainees- a figure which should courses extend over 3 and 4 years. Over for teacher trainees- a figure which should be seen in relation to the total of about this period the teacher trainee is brought be seen in relation to the total of about 16,000 places in existence at teachers colleges at the time of the commencement of the Commonwealth programme. A sum of $llm was available under this programme in the last financial year but in the event only $2.5m was spent by the States in that year. This very considerable shortfall in expenditure is a matter of some concern to the Commonwealth. It has been the subject of letters which the Secretary of my Department has written to certain State Directors-General of Education. It is our understanding that the States expect that their teacher training college building programmes will reach a peak towards the end of the triennium. In addition to this programme the Commonwealth is contributing very substantially to the capital and recurrent costs of teacher education courses in universities and colleges of advanced education. There are over 1,000 teacher trainees at colleges of advanced education and over 15,000 teacher trainees attending university. The Commonwealth is also providing capital grants for pre-school teachers colleges. In this case the expenditure will rise from just under $lm in 1970-71 to just over $lm in this financial year. Commonwealth programmes in support of teacher education total $40m in teachers colleges and colleges of advanced education in the current triennium. This support is again due to Commonwealth initiatives after consultaunder the tion with State Ministers. The Commonwealth has its own interest in, and sole responsibility for, the proviof sion of educational facilities in its own 3 Territories. In this connection the Government has been able to encourage developof ments in teacher education which it regards as desirable, such as the provision teacher training courses within multibe purpose institutions- a development which is also taking place in New South Wales, of Queensland and Tasmania. I hope other the States will follow this example. The Commonwealth is taking this initiative at the Canberra College of Advanced Education. Here the training of teachers takes place the alongside the training of young people for other professions. The teacher trainee is thus able to establish and maintain contact with other professional groups. The basic courses extend over 3 and 4 years. Over this period the teacher trainee is brought into close association with the practical situallowance is at the maximum rate applicainto close association with the practical ation which confronts the teacher in the classroom. His professional training as a teacher is given concurrently with his further education in the discipline he will subsequently teach. In encouraging these developments at the Canberra College of Advanced Education, the Government has not envisaged that College as training teachers to meet only the needs of Commonwealth Territories; it believes that there should be an alternative to the common situation where teachers are trained in a particular school system and subsequently teach in that same system. It is intended that the Canberra College will accept students for teacher training without regard to the school system in which they eventually will teach. As a result of the action being taken by the States and the Commonwealth in teacher education the major objectives of the Martin Committee are being achieved. The minimum length of course has been increased to 3 years and co-ordinating machinery is being introduced in most States to improve the academic standing of teacher education institutions. The Commonwealth's interest in teacher training is naturally becoming even more direct with its agreement to establish the Commonwealth Teaching Service, separate from the Department of Education and Science. The Teaching Service is intended to provide continuity of service and security lor teachers working in Commonwealth schools, to facilitate movement between mainland Commonwealtb school systems, and to provide a base service for selected teachers in Papua New Guinea. Legislation to give effect to the Government's decision on this matter is being prepared. Of related interest is the Commonwealth Teaching Service Scholarship Scheme which the Government has decided to introduce. This will provide awards for students who, on completion of their training, will be employed in the Commonwealth schools system. Training may be undertaken at the Canberra College of Edvanced Education or at an approved institution in one or other of the States and in courses specifically directed to teaching. No bond will be imposed. For 1972 there will be 200 of these scholartrainees now at a record level of over 1972 there will be 200 of these scholartrainees ships; these will provide for fees and a liv35,000, compared with 15,000 only in ships; these will provide for fees and ing allowance free of a means test. The 1960, there should be more than sufficient ing allowance free of a means test. The situallowance is at the maximum rate applicable to other Commonwealth tertiary scholarships. The measures 1 have just mentioned represent a significant Commonwealth contribution to the training of additional teachers for Australian schools. At the same time however the Commonwealth recognises that there are important considerations, other than the provision of finance, involved in the teacher supply situation. Such considerations include the wastage of teachers in training, which together with the loss of teachers from service substantially reduces the number of teachers who would otherwise be available. The significance of the loss of teachers from service is readily apparent from the high resignation rates of recent years. On the information available to me, resignations reached a level in 1970 of over 12 per cent of the teaching service in Government schools throughout Australia, representing a loss of over 11,000 teachers. This loss would not be a net loss because some teachers who resign are simply moving from one government school system to another, or from government to independent schools. Against this loss must be set the additional teachers coming into the government school systems through people returning to teaching, through overseas recruitment and from teacher training programmes. When we look at the total situation we find that the number of teachers in service is increasing steadily. The main significance of the loss of teachers from training and service is that shortages in particular areas could be overcome so much more quickly if the profession could retain more of those who initially embark on a teaching career. For this reason, the losses which do occur are serious, and the Commonwealth welcomes the consideration which is being given to these problems by the State education authorities and others. Honourable members will know that the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts is examining this matter at the moment. The Commonwealth will itself be seeking to minimise the impact of these problems in the way it manages its own teaching service. In short, with the number of teacher now at a record level of over a liv35,000, compared with 15,000 only in 1960, there should be more than sufficient qualified teachers emerging to meet population growth and to lower pupil-teacher ratios if the undue wastage during training and later service can be significantly reduced. The bonding system appears to have a significant effect on these matters and I am more than glad therefore that the new Commonwealth Teaching Service scholarships do not require that condition. The total cost of the various Commonwealtb scholarship scheme in 1971-72 is estimated at $43.7m compared with $38.4m in 1970-71, an increase of 14 per cent. The total number of students receiving assistance in 1971 was 66,000; in 1972 this is expected to rise to approximately 71,000. From the beginning of this year several increases were made in allowances payable to students holding various tertiary scholarships. The Government has now decided to increase the number of scholarships available under the Commonwealth advanced education scholarship scheme from 2,500 this year to 4,000 in 1972. The colleges of advanced education are expanding rapidly and it was decided that the limited additional funds available for student assistance should be used to increase the number of scholarships in this area. The estimated cost of providing the additional 1,500 awards is $430,000 in 1971-72 and over $2m when the additional awards are in full operation. This Budget marks the commencement of a new triennium in the technical training grants programme. Under this scheme, tbe Commonwealth has made available to the States $10m a year for the last 7 years, in unmatched capital grants for building and equipping technical colleges. The scheme has now been extended for a further 3 years and the amount available has been increased to an average of $12m a year over the period although the full impact will not be felt in this, the first year of educational needs for the 5 years 1971impact will not be felt in this, the first of the triennium. These funds go solely to government institutions. I place considerable importance on the continuing programmes for science laboratories and libraries in all secondary schools. They both have done much to improve the quality of education in both government and independent secondary schools. In total some $286m has already been committed to these 3 areas. I come now to a matter which has been the subject of considerable discussion in this place and elsewhere over the past year or so. When I finish speaking I will be tabling 2 documents, one concerning government schools in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and the other concerning the independent schools. The information contained in these documents was collected by my Department over the whole of Australia during a survey of educational needs. These documents will be available to honourable members. Since I was involved in the early discussion with the State Ministers for Education on this survey I propose to refer briefly to these; to trace the subsequent events and to indicate the Commonwealth's positive response to that survey through the 1970 and 1971 Premiers Conferences and Australian Loan Council meetings. Throughout its response to the survey, the Commonwealth has sought to improve the States own general nnancial resources, to enable State governments better to meet their needs and responsibilities. This is the approach which hitherto has been preferred by State Premiers. At a meeting in Adelaide in March 1969 the State Ministers for Education indicated to me their intention to conduct a survey of each State's educational needs over the ensuing 5 years. I gave 2 reactions. I said that the Commonwealth would also conduct a similar survey of the needs in its own Territories and that the Commonwealth survey would include as a separate item the needs of the independent schools in its Territories. I suggested that the States might do likewise. In the event the States' survey did not cover the needs of the independent schools; these have since been investigated by my Department, in consultation with the various independent school authorities, for each State as well as for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. The States' survey year of educational needs for the 5 years 19711975 was made available to the Commonwealth early in 1970 and published in summary form in September 1970. Mr Foster-Ther e are only 3 Government supporters in the chamber to listen to the Minister's statement on this important aspect of education. It is disgraceful. Mr MALCOLM FRASER- I am glad to have the honourable member's interest. This material related to government schools and teachers colleges, and was taken into account by tbe Commonwealth in its deliberations prior to the Premiers Conference in June 1970 at which the basts of general revenue assistance to the States was reviewed-and new arrangements made for the following 5 years. In September 1970, the Commonwealth sought further information from State education departments on their capital needs. The collection of this information took some time-th e last of it was forwarded to my predecessor in March this year-bu t it was brought together and considered by the Commonwealth before it met with the Premiers in June 1971. The outcome of the 1971 Premiers Conference also had further implications for the capacity of the States to deal with their recurrent expenditure needs. The requests that have been made by the States for assistance in financing the expenditure needs seen as resulting from the survey cannot be looked at in isolation. There are other important areas of State and Commonwealtb endeavour to be considered, and the limited availability of real assistance to the States in 1971-72, includsidered, and the limited availability of real resources means that any increase in the proportion of national resources devoted to one field of activity must necessarily be at the expense of others. In recent years governments have been spending an increasing proportion of their revenue on education, and the current financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States will enable expenditure to be maintained at a high level. The general financial situation of the States is expected to improve substantially as a result of the 1970 and 1971 Premiers Conferences. Before the 1970 arrangements,' Commonwealth general revenue grants to the States were already increasing at a faster rate than gross national product, and as a result of the 1970 arrangements those payments will grow at an even higher rate. Indeed, following the 1970 Premiers Conference it was expected that total general revenue assistance to .the States over the next 5 years could be of the order of $8,400m, compared with $4.700m over the previous 5 years-a n increase of $3,700m. Then as a result of discussions at the 1971 Premiers Conference and Loan Council meetings the States overall financial position was further budgets provide for increases in total overall financial position was further improved. In addition to a non-recurring expenditure on education of 21 per cent improved. In addition to a non-recurring grant for special revenue assistance, and the Commonwealth's continued support for a high level of borrowing programmes for State works and housing, the States received access to a new field of taxation when the Commonwealth agreed to transfer to the States the power to collect payroll tax. The States have already decided to increase their revenue through this tax. Thus it can be seen that since the States drew up their estimates of recurrent expenditure needs for the survey, there have been a number of developments which have added very considerably to their expected recurrent resources. When they prepared their survey figures they worked on the assumption that their recurrent resources for education would increase by 10 per cent per annum, but in fact their recurrent expenditure on schools and teacher training increased at the rate of 15.5 per cent per annum in 1969-70, before the new financial arrangements applied; and with the total general revenue assistance to the States in 1971-72, including the transfer of payroll tax collections at the old rate, expected to be 17 per cent greater than in 1970-71, they should be able at the very least to maintain the existing rate of growth. I might add that about 80 per cent of State recurrent expenditure on primary and secondary education goes to pay teachers' salaries. We need only look to the State budgets recently brought down for evidence of the extent to which the Commonwealth action that T have outlined has improved the States financial position. The Victorian budget, for example, includes an increase in total expenditure on education of $58.5m, and the increase in expenditure on the levels of education dealt with in the survey is of the order of $43m- a 20 per cent increase. In the same budget. State government support for independen: primary schools' recurrent costs has been doubled from $20 per student to $40 per student. In the recent South Australian budget recurrent expenditure on primary education has increased by nearly 30 per cent, as has expenditure on secondary education and on teacher training. The Queensland and Western Australian budgets provide for increases in total expenditure on education of 21 per cent and 18 per cent respectively while the Tasprevious 4 years it had averaged only 29 and 18 per cent respectively while the manian budget provides for an increase of 25 per cent in total expenditure on educa- increase in the total amounts the Common25 per cent in total expenditure on education. In Western Australia per capita grants wealth is making available to the States tion. In Western Australia per capita grants to independent schools have increased from $20 to $30 per pupil at primary schools, and from $30 at junior secondary level and $36 at senior secondary level to $40 in both cases. The Tasmanian budget also provides for an increase in per capita of all specific purpose payments in 1966-67 also provides for an increase in per capita grants to independent schools, and the Queensland budget includes an increase in per capita grants from $25 to $45 per annum for each primary student and from $67 to $77 for each secondary student in the earlier years of secondary schooling. The payment is even higher for the later years. In New South Wales the budget provides for an increase of $77m, or more than 16 per cent in total expenditure on education, and an increase in per capita grants to independent schools from $36 to $50 per annum at the primary level and from $42 to $59 at secondary level. The means test on these grants at secondary level has also been eased. ln most recent years the Commonwealth has been called upon to meet shortfalls in the borrowing programmes of State governments from its own revenues It is relevant to point out that of the total works and housing programme approved by the Loan Council and supported by the Commonwealth in 1971-72, $210m or about a quarter of the total amount takes the form of a non-repayable Commonwealth capital grant rather than a loan. This grant may be used for expenditure on non-revenue producing assets and therefore is applicable identical with the current ratio in universiproducing assets and therefore is applicable to school building programmes; this development began in 1970-71 and should be of benefit to the States. The Commonwealth's capital expenditure on education has been increasing in recent years. It now represents 35 per cent of all capital expenditure by governments on education whereas 10 years ago it represented only 18 per cent. What is more, an increasing proportion of Commonwealth capital expenditure on education is being directed at the educational levels dealt with in the survey of needs; minute for the evidence. The report of the levels dealt with in the survey of needs; this proportion has averaged 40 per cent Scott Committee, which examined question this proportion has averaged 40 per cent over the last 4 years, whereas over the of class size in New South Wales, did over the last 4 years, whereas over Tasprevious 4 years it had averaged only 29 per cent. There is a similar pattern of increase in the total amounts the Commonwealth is making available to the States specifically for education through special purpose grants. These payments to the States for education have increased by an average of 23 per cent over the last 5 years, and have increased from 22 per cent of all specific purpose payments in 1966-67 to 32 per cent in 1971-72. Notwithstanding the claims the States have made for capital funds for education, it is nonetheless the case that where the States have had under their control Commonwealth capital aid funds for education they have not always been able to spend these funds in the period for which they were allocated. I have already mentioned the $llm allocated for teachers colleges in 1970-71, of which only $2.5m was spent in that year. When the States estimates from the survey of needs are examined in detail there are some points which call for particular attention. In the case of capital expenditure, for example, one State claimed that 69,000 new places for primary school pupils should be built over a 5-year period during which primary enrolments are expected to decrease by 4,000, whereas another State sought to build 14,000 new places for primary school pupils over the same period to cater for an expected increase in enrolments of 24,000. In the case of recurrent expenditure, one State based its estimate of funds required on the assumption that it would have a pupil-teacher ratio of 11.9:1 in its secondary schools by. 1975, which is virtually identical with the current ratio in universities of 11.6:1. Although recent improvements in pupil/teacher ratios have been welcome, I think it is relevant, in the context of a survey of needs such as this, to keep in mind that research in the related area of class size has failed to substantiate the view that pupil performance and achievement are directly related to class size. Mr Bryant-Fai r go. Mr MALCOLM FRASER-Jus t wait a minute for the evidence. The report of the Scott Committee, which examined question the of class size in New South Wales, did recommend reductions in class size; but that report also stated that the research evidence on the effects of class size was most unsatisfactory. It recommended the carrying out of a carefully planned study on which future decisions could be based, and the constant review of future policy on class size in the light of emerging evidence. It should be noted that the Scott report drew particular attention to research studies by Fleming and Marklund and expressed general agreement with their conclusions. Fleming found that 'if there are any correlations at all between size of class and attainment they are inconsistent and of a low order', and Marklund that 'under typical conditions class size, in itself, appears to bc an unimportant factor'. I mention these findings as a reminder that there are questions other than those of class size affecting the quality of education benefit to the States and the Commonclass size affecting the quality of education and that the benefits to be gained from tackling questions of educational content and method may be greater than those to be gained from reducing student-teacher ratios to near-university level. All this points to the need for further research. I hope to encourage this and will approach the appropriate authorities, including the States, on this matter. We have established the Partridge Committee to advise on research grants in education and to take the initiative in sponsoring research. I hope that, as a result of these steps, an adequate research coverage will be given to thi.s important area of class size. While there have heen significant overseas studies we need more evidence and examination of the Australian position in an effort to establish agreed objectives. The fact that teachers' salaries absorb over 80 per cent of all current expenditure in the schools area explain the importance of this problem. I have not the slightest doubt that we seriously need more well directed educational research. As our system grows this will become more important. We will need to be able to distinguish better those factors that have a significant impact on student attainment. There were, too, considerable variations between States in the pupil-teacher ratio objectives each was aiming at for the final year of the Survey period. In the case of primary schools, one State was planning to.move from a ratio of 24.5 : 1 to 21.3 : 1 over the 5-year period whereas another was planning to move from 32.3 : 1 to 30: 1 over the same period. In the case of secondary schools, one State was planning to move from 17.5:1 to 11.9:1 over the 5-year and another from 19.1 :1 to 18.3 : 1. While there may well be reasons for some of these interstate differences, they do suggest that the survey totals are based on differing State views about needs and objectives rather than on a consistent nation wide view. This is also apparent in matters such as the classification of building proposals in order of priority and in the wide divergences in building costs. At the primary school level, for example, the estimates of cost per pupil placed ranged from about $425 to almost $1,400-tha t is, between States. I think it would be of benefit to the States and the Commonwealth if closer consultation took place between them on matters such as building design so that information on their individual experiences could be pooled for the good of all. I propose to take this matter up with my State colleagues. The observations which I have made about the survey of needs for the government schools demonstrate that the figures presented by the State Ministers for Education are open to serious questioning. The Commonwealth has reservations also about tbe materia] furnished by the independent schools. This was collected and collated by the Commonwealth for consideration by both the Commonwealth and the States when it became apparent that the State authorities, for the purpose of the Survey, were preparing material only about their own State schools. Today I am releasing a statement prepared by my Department to draw together and aggregate the returns from independent schools about capital expenditure and teachers' salaries over the 5-year period. As explained in the departmental document, which I will table, there are deficiencies in the material. Mr Whitlam-Wil l the Minister incorporate that document? Mr MALCOLM FRASER-M y intention was to table the document. Copies are available for any honourable members who wish them.

Legislation to set up stanthe Commonwealth Teaching Service is In order to cope with the rapid expanis sion of enrolments in government primary secondary schools in both the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory a substantial programme of new Comschool buildings is being undertaken and continue.

Also in the course of construction is Darwin's third high school, at Casuarina, to be opened in 1973. Addibe tional secondary accommodation also is being provided at Katherine and Tennant Creek. New primary schools will open in the four of Canberra's suburbs during 1972 and a similar number is planned for 1973. In the Northern Territory a new primary school is under construction at Moil, a of Darwin, and one will be comFor menced at Waraman, another Darwin suburb, this financial year. Last year the then Minister for Education and Science mentioned the proposal to provide a community college at Darwin. Planning has progressed satisfactorily with this project, as and I expect that a contract for the conby struction of the first stage will be let of towards the end of thefinancialyear. Earlier in this statement, 1 spoke of the survey of needs. In looking at the various current statements of needs and claims for assistance, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that our overall standards of education have in fact been rising consistently. We now have 42 per cent of all 1518 year olds still at school whereas 10 years ago we had only 26 per cent. There has also been an increase in the proportion of pupils remaining at school to the matriculation grades', 13 per cent of pupils at government schools remained to the matriculation grade 10 years ago, but this pro- future challenge and so too a boy's or riculation grade 10 years ago, but this portion has now risen to 25 per cent. We now have a pupil-teache r ratio of 22:1 in government schools, while 5 years ago it was 25:1. In non-government schools the pupil-teache r ratio has improved from 29:1 to 25:1 over the same 5-year period. The number of teachers-in-training has increased by over 40 per cent in the last 5 years, while the number of pupils in school has increased by only 10 per cent. The number of bachelor degrees conferred on the 20-24 age group of the population has increased from 622 per 100,000 in 1966 to almost 1,250 per 100,000 population in 1970, and this is an indication of; among other things, the increasing capacity and output of our secondary school system. Of course, there remain unfilled needs in special areas-teacher s in certain subjects is one-bu t the general picture is one of consistent improvement. The Commonwealth has undoubtedly made a major contribution to these improvements. It has done this in 2 ways. Tt has introduced programmes of direct assistance, such as the teacher training captage; a community for whom the interassistance, such as the teacher training ital grants. And in the last 2 years the Commonwealth has concentrated on improving the States' revenue resources, as is seen in the 1970 and 1971 Premiers' Conferences and demonstrated by the State budgets brought down this year. The total expenditure on education in these budgets represents, for the 6 States combined, an increase of 17 per cent over the previous year. As we look beyond the end of this decade we must realise that much of the hope-man y of the plans we have for Australia in the last decades of this centurywill depend upon the skills, expertise and number of nations makes this course more will depend upon the skills, expertise adaptability of the Australian people. Tomorrow's tasks will require higher will contribute to this objective, but a Tomorrow's tasks will require higher skills and better management than in the broad, liberal and fair minded education, skills and better management than in the past. If we cannot match the large nations in capital and invention, we can at least be our own managers; indeed such a requirement is essential. The quantity and quality of education-costin g presently over $ 1,500m a year-i s a significant charge upon this nation, but few other expenses represent such worthwhile investment for the future. Investment in education is investment in adaptability and capacity to survive. This is true of the nation and of the man. National skills and expertise could well be crucial in meeting some pro- future challenge and so too a boy's or girl's early training would influence his or her whole future capacity to meet changing circumstances and to participate in emerging technology. Through education we can do much to reduce inequality. As we march towards national goals we must place equality of opportunity high on the list. Equality of opportunity means more than anything else, I believe, equality of educational opportunity. As in so many matters we are unlikely to achieve complete equality. It depends not only on what a State may do but also on the attitudes and outlook of parents, which have a quite crucial impact on a student's attitude to work. Perhaps of even more importance than equipping students to meet future technological change is the need to enable man to live with man. We ought to strive harder than ever before to achieve what no generation has yet achieved: A community composed of men and women for whom human values are more important than material advancaptage; a community for whom the interrelationship of man with man has become the most important concern; a community in which tolerance and understanding reign and prejudice is abandoned. Only when such communities inhabit a nation and when such nations engulf the world will the shadows and fears of present or potential tyrannies be permanently consigned to the past. If anyone suggests such an ideal cannot be achieved let those who can believe strive the harder. The power presently available to a and number of nations makes this course more necessary and more urgent. Many strands will contribute to this objective, but a broad, liberal and fair minded education, with equality of opportunity firmly established, must surely influence our future course. We must constantly re-define our education goals to ensure that they are effectively oriented towards these objectives^-toward s the maximum development of the individual's talents, his aspirations, his personality and his voluntary self-discipline. Much of this speech has been descriptive of Commonwealth effort, but I hope honourable members will also find an expression of objective to which they can all subscribe. As in the past several years, my Department will keep in close touch with State and independent education authorities to maintain the firm basis of consultation and co-operation which is necessary in seeking to attain these objectives. With the concurrence of honourable members 1 incorporate in Hansard a statement illustrating the additional Commonwealth financial assistance grants made available to the States and a table showing the build-up in the number of Commonwealth scholarships available in recent years. THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES MADE TO THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ARRANGEMENTS DURING 1970 and 1971 Under arrangements settled at tbe June 1970 Premiers' Conference to run for the five years 4970-71 to 1974-75, the financial assistance grants, transfer, ln particular, tbe Commonwealth agreed 4970-71 to 1974-75, the financial assistance grants, which finance about one-half of State current budget expenditure, continue to be determined under a formula wbich increases the grants in proportion to increases in population and average wages-th e two main factors affecting State current expenditures-a s well as a betterment factor designed to assist the States to improve the standard and range of their services. However, for 1970-71 there was a special addition of $40m to 1970-71 there was a special addition of $40m to the formula grants. Then, for the purpose of determining these grants for 1971-72 and subsequent years, tbis additional grant forms part of a new base to which the formula will be applied and the betterment factor element in the formula is and the betterment factor element in the formula is increased from 1.2 per cent to 1.8 per cent. Tbe Commonwealth is also assisting the States specifically, in meeting interest and sinking fund charges on their debt. Grants are being made to meet the debt charges on a progressively increasing amount of Stat: debt so that, as from the commencement of 1974-75, the Commonwealth will have taken over complete responsibility for the debt charges on $1,000m of State debt. In addition, the Commonweallh provided $200m of the 1970-71 borrowing programmes for State capital works in the form of interest-free grants thereby relieving the States of debt charges they would otherwise have bad to pay. These grants are to increase proportionately to tbe increase in the total Loan Council works and housing programme. (In 1971-72 for example they will total almost $210m.) At the time these arrangements were settled It was estimated that the total of financial assistance under the arrangements would grow at around 2 i to 3 per cent per annum faster than if lhe previous grants arrangements had continued unaltered. As the revenue grants payable under the previous arrangements were increasing at a faster rate than gross national product, this represented a very substantial improvement. The financial assistance grants arrangements were further amended by an undertaking by tbe Commonwealth to make good the loss in State revenues during 1970-71 as a result of the discontinuation of receipts duty after 30th September 1970 The Commonwealth agreed that, for 197172 and subsequent years, the amounts of receipts duty which it was estimated would have been collected in 1970-71 had it been a 'normal' year would be added to the base used in determining the financial assistance grants payable under the grants formula. By this means the Commonwealth is, in effect, providing for the continued payment to the States of compensation for the loss of receipts duty. A further change in the arrangements has resulted from decisions taken at the Premiers' Conference on 16th June to increase the Stales' capacity to raise their own revenues. Briefly, the Commonweallh agreed to transfer pay-roll tax to the States on the basis that the States' financial assistance grants will be reduced to help offset the loss to Commonwealth revenue resulting from the transfer. However, the Commonwealth agreed that the reduction in the States' grants in 1971-72 and future years will be smaller than the loss to Commonwealth revenue as a result of the transfer, ln particular, tbe Commonwealth agreed to make thc reduction in the States grants in 1971-72 smaller by an amount now estimated at $22.4m. This smaller reduction will also be made to the 'base' used to determine the formula grants for 1972-73 and subsequent years so that the States will continue to benefit from this factor in those years. The Commonwealth also agreed at the June 1971 Premiers' Conference to provide $40m special revenue assistance to the States in 1971-72 by way of a non-recurring grant. As a result of all these measures the States will receive in 1971-72 an estimated additional $274m in general revenue assistance from the Commonwealth over and above what they would have received had the arrangements which existed before 1970-71 continued unaltered. This is a remarkable increase even if the estimated amount of $ 100.6m representing receipts duty compensation grants included in tbe above figure (which could be regarded as replacing revenue which the States had hoped to gain from their own receipts duly) is abstracted. In the circumstances tbe Commonwealth believes tbat the State Governments are now better placed to meet their responsibilities including recurrent expenditure on education. The following table sets out details of the components of the $274m increase mentioned above: APPROXIMATE ADDITIONAL REVENUE ASSISTANCE TO THE STATES IN 1971-72 AS A RESULT OF DECISIONS TAKEN AT JUNE 1970 PREMIERS' CONFERENCE AND SUBSEQUENTLY 1 Additional assistance under arrangements settled at the June 1970 Premiers' Conference(i) Additional iinancial grants (a) (ii) Debt charges assistance (iii) Savings in debt charges as a result of capital grants in lieu of loan raisings..

I will recall the history of this survey. I n March 1969 the State Education Ministers met and announced: 'When the State surveys are completed they will be collated and considered by tbe Australian Education Council. Action will then be taken to a nationwide plan for the fulfilment of needs in accordance with priorities determined by thc States. Thc Commonwealth's co-operation will be sought lo put this plan into effect.' They met again on 8th August 1969 and announced: 'The whole (survey) will eventually be presented to the Australian Education Council to consider the findings witb a view to formulating a nationwide plan for the fulfilment of educational needs in accordance with the priorities determined by the States. 'As the financial resources at present available to the States are not sufficient to meet the needs that would be revealed by the survey, a joint approach would be made to the Commonwealth for additional nnancial assistance to education in these areas.' On 13th August 1969 the present Minister for Education and Science made a statement to the House in which he stated: 'On completion of the surveys the Commonwealth Minister for Education <ind Science and the Australian Education Council, which is composed of the Ministers for Education in all the Stales, will consider proposals for joint action to that the difficulty which New South Wales Stales, will consider proposals for joint action promote the further development of education in schools.' Sir. unilaterally the Commonwealth has now gone back on these forecasts and these undertakings. The nationwide survey has been in tbe hands of all the Ministers since May last year. It should have been possible to reject any Commonwealth participation in it before this. Before going into more detail on this might 1 refer to some 4 passages in the Minister's statement. I do so at this stage because I apprehend that since we are about to embark upon a debate on the Estimates and because a very great number of other Ministerial statements are ahead of this one on the notice paper it is most unlikely that we shall have the opportunity to debate the Minister's statement. Firstly I draw attention to the Minister's statement on the increased offer to the States for university and colleges of advanced education expenditure during the period to December next year. I noted in the newspapers over the weekend that it is doubtful whether Victoria will be able to pay the grant to earn its share of this additional giant, f also note that New South Wales will do so only if the universities and colleges increase their fees. Mr Maicoim Fraser-W e have been told that Victoria will be able to meet its share. Mr WHITLAM-Th e Minister assures rae- I am glad to have the assurance-tha t Victoria will be able to meet its share. The New South Wales Minister for Education has forecast that an increase of 16 per cent in fees will be required by that State's universities and colleges. It would be helpful if the House was given a statement of the prospects of the matching grants in each State. I gathered from the statements in the newspapers that the State Premiers and Treasurers had had little notice of the proposal. The next matter to which I direct attention is the criticism that the Minister makes that although Slim was available under the teachers college programme for 1970-71 only S2.5m was spent by the States in that year. I had used the same figures in criticism of some of the State governments, particularly that of New South Wales. However, stature by the fact that he is a member larly that of New South Wales. However, I was impressed with the argument and at this stage I am convinced by the argument to that the difficulty which New South Wales has had in spending the amount available to it is that in respect of the teachers college capital grants, as with all other Commonwealth initiatives in education, no notice was given to the States and no consultation was held with the States. Mr Malcolm Fraser-Thi s is not correct. Mr WHITLAM- I am quoting from information which has. been gleaned by my colleague, the honourable member for Barton ( Mr Reynolds). I hold no brief for the State Government of New South Wales but I have been impressed with repeated statements by its Ministers that the prudent course for mat State Government was to carry out proper research into the nature of contemporary teacher education facilities before undertaking the expenditure which had become available to it by way of a windfall. The third matter to which I would direct attention is the Minister's statement that there was a resignation rate of teachers in 1970 of over 12 per cent. This may well be the Australia-wide average. As I understand the situation, the resignation rate in New South Wales and Victoria is considerably larger. I have not the transcript of evidence but I have a newspaper report of the evidence given to the Senate Committee to which the Minister referred by Mr P. W. Hughes, head of the School of Teacher Education at the Canberra College of Advanced Education. This evidence was given less than a month ago. Mr Hughes stated that the number of teacher resignations throughout Australia has more than cancelled out the gain from new teachers. In a written submission to the Committee, Mr Hughes said that there were about 35,000 students in training which would mean that about 9,000 to 12,000 new teachers would be available each year. Since about 3,000 to 4,000 new teachers would be enough to cope with population increase it might be thought that the situation was improving but this was not happening because of increasingly heavy losses from both training and teaching. The loss of teachers through resignation was running at between 12 and 16 per cent. Mr Hughes evidence is given even more stature by the fact that he is a member of the committee appointed earlier this year by the New South Wales Government to examine the loss of teachers in that State. Finally, I would draw attention to another case of combined statistics which I believe on further analysis will show the extent to which there is very great inequality in our educational system. The Minister stated: We now have a pupil:teacher ratio of 22:1 in governnient schools, while five years ago it was know whether the Premiers of New South governnient schools, while five years ago 25:1. In non-government schools the pupil: 1 teacher ratio has improved from 29:1 to 25:1 over the same five year period. In fact these figures are reached by pooling the ratios in the Catholic and other nongovernment schools and pooling the ratios in primary and secondary grades. I rely on an answer which the honourable member for Parramatta, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs ( Mr N. H. Bowen) gave me a year ago when he was Minister for Education and Science. I have on the notice paper at the moment a question asking for updated information. In August 1969 in primary grades in New South Wales the pupil-teacher ratio in Catholic schools was 36.8 and in other nongovernment schools 21.1. In Victoria the ratios were respectively 38.9 and 18.6, in Queensland 35.2 and 22.2, in South Australia 32.6 and 22.1, in Western Australia 37.4 and 22.1 and in Tasmania 35.6 and 20.1. More relevant and more comparable are the figures for secondary schools. Comparatively speaking there are not many pupils at primary non-government schools which are not run by Catholic orders. It is in secondary grades that most children attend the non-government schools which are not conducted by Catholic orders. Accordingly, I give the pupil-teacher ratios in Catholic and other nongovernment schools in secondary grades in the 6 States as follows: New South Wales 24.2 and 13.3, Victoria 27.1 and 14.8, Queensland 25.4 and 18.8, South Australia 24.0 and 15.6, Western Australia 23.6 and 14.5 and in Tasmania 22.5 and 13.7. It is very clear that whatever the validty of the pupil-teacher ratio may be the ratio is almost twice as much to the disadvantage of Catholic schools as of other non-government schools. I have gone into some detail on this matter because I believe it can be quite misleading to quote a total figure when the individual schools in the 2 categories show so much disparity. 1 pointed out that the Minister has abandoned any joint action on a nationwide survey. I repeat tbat I can understand the difficulty that one has with the States. It took from 7th September to 23rd December for the previous Prime Minister to get answers from the Premiers of Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia concerning the survey. I do not it was know whether the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria have yet answered the letter that was addressed to them. It took from llth September last year to March this year for the State Ministers to answer a letter from the immediate past Minister for Education and Science and at this stage 1 believe that the only authorities which have tabled their sections of the survey are the South Australian and Western Australian Governments, after the change of government in each State and, today, the 2 mainland territories. The other States have not yet tabled their surveys. Mr Maicoim Fraser- I am advised they intend to do so. Mr WHITLAM- I compliment the Minister on having pressured the States into getting this far because his 2 predecessors were unable to get them to do so nor did they themselves table the Territory or non-government school surveys. (Extension of time granted.) I thank the House. Last April the Government members committee on education and science expressed the following view: It was not in the Commonwealth interest for the details of the survey of educational needs to continue to bc unavailable and the sooner we were in a position to judge whether the detailed survey is a sufficient basis for further or alternative Commonwealth programming the better. That view was expressed over 5 months ago. I should now like to speak in purely general terms. There is much in what the Minister has announced which is commendable and which will have the support of the Opposition. For instance, the proposals which he has outlined for teacher education in regard to Commonwealth Territories are ones which we would hope the States themselves would follow. It is only in the Territories that the Commonwealth is now carrying out the recommendations of the Martin Committee which were presented to Senator Gorton, as he then was, when he was Minister for Education and Science in the days of the Menzies Government. Tbe Government still takes the attitude that it sbould distinguish between teacher education and all other tertiary education. It is only in respect of teacher education that the Commonwealth has not made provisions generally for salaries and scholarships or recurrent expenditure generally. Mr Malcolm Fraser-W e do in universities and colleges. Mr WHITLAM-Yes , but the Martin Committee recommended that there should be the same provision for teacher education in general, including education in teachers colleges per se. Mr Malcolm Fraser-Th e Commonwealth, I think, has taken the view that education in a multi-purpose institution is very much more desirable and therefore this is an incentive to move towards this institution. Mr WHITLAM- 1 could not agree more with the Minister, but the Martin Committee said the same thing back in 1964. It is unhealthy that any employeebecause every teacher is going to be an employee-shoul d be trained by the prospective employer and, in many cases, the only possible employer. This is largely responsible for the lack of morale among people undergoing teacher education or engaged in the teaching profession compared with people undergoing other forms of tertiary education or pursuing the careers which that education opens to them. I believe that the hang-up, the inhibition, that the Government feels in this respect is just an aspect of the hangup, the inhibition that it has towards schools in general. It used to be said some years ago that the Constitution did not permit the Commonwealth to do anything about schools but, of course, the Constitution permits the Commonwealth to do anything about schools that it does about universities. The Federal Government would now never tolerate and the States would not now welcome the situation where they were without the benefit of the periodic public advice given on universities and colleges of advanced education by various Commonwealth bodies such as the Universities Commission and the committees on research grants, advanced education, standards for science facilities in independent secondary schools, teaching of Asian languages and cultures and now, under Professor Partridge, research grants in education. The facts which the Minister has given concerning the different projections and the different programmes of the States bring home to us all the more clearly how necessary it is that there should be some standing body to collate these matters for the nation's schools. It is no longer good enough that the Commonwealth should act in a piecemeal, spasmodic and capricious manner in relation to schools. We can no longer take the attitude that the States will have enough money to deal with schools. We do not act in this way and we do not take this attitude concerning tertiary education, except as regards teachers colleges in the narrow sense. It is quite futile for the Government to continue to adopt this attitude towards schools. The Minister very properly stated that equality of opportunity means, more than anything else, equality of educational opportunity. I could not agree more but, in fact, nothing in his statement brings educational opportunity any closer in any of the States. It is true that it is closer in the Territories. It is only in the Territories that every child has at least one year of preschool education. It is only in the Territories that a man or a woman can receive teacher education in the same way as he or she can have any other form of tertiary education. Mr Malcolm Fraser-Tha t is not correct. People in New South Wales, Queensland or Tasmania can receive teacher education either in universities or colleges of advanced education in precisely the same way. Mr WHITLAM-I f a person goes, as most people do, to a teachers college which is run by a State education department, he does not get the same opportunities. I note and I applaud the fact that there are more places now available for prospective teachers in universities and in the colleges of advanced education, but the great majority of prospective teachers still attend teachers colleges conducted by their prospective employer. It is only in the Territories that people will be able to get the full scope of tertiary education as teachers and the full scope of pre-school education. I can conclude my remarks by emphasising how deficient we are at the very outset, on the threshold of education. I quote the percentages of children who can have pre-school education. In the Territories, everybody gets pre-school education. In New South Wales, 2.9 per cent of the population enjoys this education; in Victoria, the figure is 27.1 per cent; in Queensland, 7.3 per cent; in South Australia 14.5 per cent; in Western Australia, 9.9 per cent; and, in Tasmania, it is time to time, both the needs of the peoples tralia, 9.9 per cent; and, in Tasmania, it 14.3 per cent. I would hope that we will not again have a ministerial statement on education without mentioning the opportunity for pre-school education which, in the interest of future equality, every child in the States should have. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mr Drury)Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Mr Reynolds- Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a most important matter. The Minister has made a lengthy statement which has wide implications not only for the Commonwealth Parliament and every State Parliament but also for the whole realm of private education in Australia. I should like the Minister to give an assurance that this matter will be debated in this House in the fairly immediate future. Mr Malcolm Fraser- I am afraid that 1 cannot give the honourable member such an assurance, but I do give the assurance that I will take the matter up with the Leader of the House. I was at pains to make this statement before the debate on the Estimates because I though it would be of some advantage to members on that occasion. However, I take note of the honourable member's point and I will take it up with the Leader of the House.

The Prime Minister ( Mr ernment. We have been informed that the continent. The Prime Minister ( Mr MCMahon) has on several occasions sent personal messages to the leaders of both India and Pakistan. To date the Government has provided Si.5m in food, shelter and medical supplies to help alleviate the plight of the East Pakistani refugees at present in camps in India. At the time that this aid to the refugees was announced the Government stated that it would not necessarily be the limit of our assistance to the region. We said that we would keep closely in touch with the situation and assess, from is time to time, both the needs of the peoples of the region and our capacity to help. We have continued to receive detailed reports on the situation from our missions in the area, from United Nations' sources and from visitors to the area, including some members of this House. Reports from East Pakistan itself indicate that some areas face acute food shortages, and possible famine. The area has also been subject to considerable flooding in recent weeks. Earlier this year, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant, issued an appeal for emergency assistance for the people of East Pakistan. He asked that such assistance be channelled through the United Nations agencies particularly UNICEF and the world food programme. The United Nations has now established a relief organisation to assist in the reception and distribution of relief supplies in East Pakistan, and some donors such as the United States of America, Britain and Canada are channelling aid through it. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has on a number of occasions stated that the Government was keeping under review the course of events in East Pakistan, and would play its part in the provision of relief assistance. The plight of the millions of Pakistanis who have left their homes, and the prosof starvation faced by some of those who have remained behind, have caused the Government grave concern. The sufferings of the ordinary people of East Pakishave also struck a deep chord of sympathy among all the people of Australia. - The number of refugees in India is to be approaching nine million. There is no need for me to explain to honmembers the substantial economic conburden which this problem of deep human is imposing on the Indian Government. We have been informed that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will shortly issue a renewed appeal for more international help. In the light of the compelling need for aid and of the appeals made by die United Nations, the Government has decided to provide a further $1.5m in humanitarian assistance to the region. This will double Australia's contribution to the international emergency relief effort. It will bring our total aid to date to $3m. Of this additional aid $500,000 worth of rice will be given to India for emergency relief for the refugees. This is in accord with the Indian authorities preference for rice as a food grain for relief supplies in the refugee camps. It is of course additional to previous announcements of food and other aid to India. A similar amount of rice will be provided through United Nations agencies for distribution in East Pakistan. The provision of rice will be additional to Pakistan's normal allocation of aid wheat under thc Food Aid Convention, valued at around $1.4m. The remaining half million dollars will be divided between a $250,000 cash grant to the Secretary-General's appeal, part of which we expect will be used to pay freight costs on the rice shipment, and the provision through United Nations agencies of other urgently needed foodstuffs, such as edible oils. The precise composition of the shipment of foodstuffs will be decided upon as part of the broad international effort. The Government shares the deep concern felt by Australians at the human suffering which has followed events in East Pakistan. While the Government is moved by compassion in providing the additional assistance, it does not regard it as an act of charity but as a fulfilment of our obligations to the international community. We will continue to take a close interest in developments on the Indian subcontinent and to play our part in providing aid for the people of the region. I present the following paper: Aid to India and Pakistan-Ministeria l Statetributions that were made by Sir Paul HasAid to India and Pakistan-Ministeria l ment, 5th October 1971. Motion (by Mr Howson) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Mr BEAZLEY (Fremantle) (4.43)-Th e admiration. This contribution was in the Mr BEAZLEY (Fremantle) (4.43)-Th e Opposition welcomes the statement made form of 580,000 tons of wheat. Opposition welcomes the statement by the Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr This type of aid was made feasible by the Minister for Primary Industry Sinclair) as far as it goes, indicating that another $1.5m in food, shelter and medical supplies is being donated by the Australian Government to assist in this crisis. However, we feel that the aid is far too tied to specific commodities. In the administration of this form of relief, a grant of financial assistance in foreign exchange to the Indian Government, and I presume also to the Pakistani Government, would give a greater flexibility to their aid programmes. I do not know what the current figure is but on the latest figures I saw the Indian Government had spent on refugees 120 crores of rupees. I understand that a crore represents 10 million rupees. Also, donations from outside amounted to 8.2 crores which is one-fifteenth of what the maintenance of refugees had cost the Indian Government. This expenditure has meant that all sorts of development projects in India have had to go by the board because that country's budgetary effort has been distorted by this sudden and unexpected expenditure on 9 million people who had. erupted over their borders into India as a result of the crisis in East Pakistan. The Minister mentioned the Indian Government's preference for rice in the refugee camps. However, he slurred over the question of wheat in East Pakistan itself. There is no statement that the Government of Pakistan prefers rice to wheat. On the contrary, there is a reference to the fact that the Government of Pakistan receives some wheat aid now. Mr Sinclair-M y understanding is that the Government also prefers rice for East Pakistan. Mr BEAZLEY-Yes . One of the factors about the preference for rice is that although there are considerable wheat consuming populations in both parts of the Indian sub-continent, these people do not have the means of turning wheat into immediately nutritious and edible food as they do in the handling of rice. I remind the House of the extremely generous conStatetributions that were made by Sir Paul Hasluck during the Bihar famine. These contributions were worth $35m and anyone who can screw this amount of money out of the Australian Treasury has my admiration. This contribution was in the made form of 580,000 tons of wheat. ( Mr This type of aid was made feasible when Sir Paul Hasluck set up in India 6 magnificent modem bakeries each of which, as 1 remember, had the capacity to produce 1 million loaves of bread a day. If we turn wheat into bread we have an immediate palatable means of supplying food to people even if they are traditional rice eaters. That seemed to me to be one of the valuable features of the aid that was given by Australia in that earlier crisis. I am sure that both the Indian and Pakistani Governments would be grateful for financial assistance to spend in the ways that occur to them immediately. I do not belittle the expenditure by Australia of another $1.5m for 9 million refugees. However, anybody looking at this contribution could assume that it will not mean that there will be a vast transformation of the position of the refugees. If rice can be obtained from Burma any foreign exchanges can be given to obtain that rice, or if rice can be obtained from other neighbouring countries, a financial grant by the Australian Government as a form of aid is something worth considering. This form of assistance would enable India, or Pakistan for that matter, to mobilise the productive resources of other countries than Australia. If the preference is for rice, our capacity to provide it is not as great as is that of some of the neighbours of India and Pakistan. Therefore I ask the Government again to consider not merely grants in kind and some gFants in cash to meet freights and some grants in personnel to carry out medical work, but also financial assistance to 2 countries which are notoriously short of foreign exchange to enable them to draw on the resources of countries other than Australia at Australia's expense. I do not believe that monopoly of concern for this sort of thing is on either side of the House. But I ask that there be a restoration of the idea of adequacy of effort which seemed to me to be one of the characteristics of a former Foreign Minister when this sort of crisis occurred. I would remind honourable members that the Chifley Government during the time of Britain's crisis put through United Kingdom aid Acts amounting to £45m in the days when the basic wage was £4 5s a week. That Government also gave £25m to the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund. There was a conception of raising a sum of money that would'make some real impact on tbe situation. Welcome as the $1.5m worth of aid is, let us face the fact that we cannot regard a contribution of this size to be spent on a population of 9 million people, which is almost equal to the population of Australia, as being a very, very significant one. Debate (on motion by Mr Graham) adjourned. ASSENT TO BILLS Assent to the following Bills reported: Post and Telegraph Bill 1971 Post and Telegraph Rates Bill 1971 Broadcasting and Television Bill (No. 2) 1971 GOVERNMENTS MEDICAL SCHEME Discussion of Matter of Public Importance Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mr Drury)I have received a letter from the honourable member for Bendigo ( Mr Kennedy) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government's subsidised medical scheme. I call upon those memoers who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places.) Mr KENNEDY (Bendigo) (4.51)-M r Deputy Speaker, the Opposition regards the disastrous failure of the Government's subsidised medical scheme as an urgent matter of public importance. Involving, as it does, the welfare of tens of thousands of Australian families, this matter of urgency is of the utmost importance. It represents our demand for action after almost 2 years of dereliction of responsibility by the Government. Like the entire voluntary health insurance system that the scheme was aimed at helping to prop up, it is on the point of collapse. The passage of almost 2 years since its introduction in January last year has dramatically highlighted in the most compelling way the failure of a system whose objective is not the welfare of people, but the protection of property and profit for vested interests in the medical insurance business and the propagation of party dogma at any expense to the community. The failure of the subsidised medical scheme is yet further proof that the Australian Labor Party's system of automatic insurance through the pay packet, levied according to ability to pay and with exemptions for low income groups, is not only the most equitable means, but also the only effective means of insuring the entire community against the cost of ill health. It was inevitable that the Government's subsidised medical scheme should fail to reach the poor in the Australian community. It was not, after all, intended to do service benefits in 1970 were insured with munity. It was not, after all, intended to so. Its aim was not to relieve hardship and poverty. The scheme could have been one of the most significant pieces of social engineering in the nation's history. For tens of thousands of Australian families it could have helped to provide a break in the poverty cycle in which low income, poor housing, poor diet arid poor hygiene are passed on from parents to children. But this was not the Liberal Party's objective. The Government's objective was to perpetuate the existing system of health insurance. A major criticism of this system was that some 15 to 20 per cent of the population either did not insure or could not afford to insure themselves within the existing system. With this major criticism of the Nimmo Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance posing as a threat to thc Government's system, the appearance had to be given that something was being done. Yet in inflicting on the community the continued survival of the voluntary health insurance scheme, all that the Liberal Party was doing was inflicting on the poorer people of Australia the massive jungle of paper work and red tape which had already made the system wasteful and irrelevant for the majority of people. If the Government had intended to restrict its claimed improvements to the smallest number of people possible it could scarcely have produced a better scheme than the subsidised medical scheme. Those who were uninsured 2 years ago are still uninsured; those who were most vulnerable to the ravages of sickness and the financial disasters associated with sickness are still exposed. The Government's scheme is as useless today as it was 2 years ago. The benefits organisations thrive in their wealth and in their multitudes. The medical profession profits and prospers. The poor are ignored. Government Ministers have been so acutely embarrassed by the failure of their subsidised medical scheme that they have resorted to the most transparent manipulation offigures.Let us look at the statistics of failure which the Government has had to falsify, exaggerate and inflate. According to a written answer given to a question on notice on 16th September last by the Minister for Health (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson), only about 40 per cent of all those people receiving social do service benefits in 1970 were insured with a private benefits organisation. The figures indicate that only about 40 per cent of the 200,000 people registered with the Commonwealth Department of Social Services took the second step to insure witb a benefits organisation. So only 4 in 10 of that group of people have covered themselves. Of over 100,000 migrant families and individuals who arrived in Australia in 1970, only about 27,000, or 1 in 4, applied for registration with a health benefits organisation. They were all automatically entitled to coverage, but only 1 in 4 insured with a private benefits organisation. Figures given in 1969 and 1970 by the former Minister for Health-th e present Minister for Immigration (Dr Forbes)who introduced this scheme indicated that there were approximately 184,000 specifically low income families living on the minimum wage or $6 above it-thes e figures are in black and white-wh o would have been entitled to full or partial subsidy for the cost of health insurance. But the figures given by the Minister for Health indicate that only about 13,000 or 7 per cent of these people had registered with the Commonwealth Government and that only one-half of this number had taken the step to register with a private benefits organisation. These are the statistics of failure. I have quoted publicly these statistics, derived from the Minister for Health himself, to point up the collapse of this scheme. The superseded Minister for Health, the present Minister for Immigration, says that the figures are misleading. Little wonder that the former Minister for Health so deceitfully resorts to distorted figures to cover up the failure of the scheme of Similarly, probably 52 per cent of the cover up the failure of the scheme of which he spoke so highly when in the males receiving sickness benefit had been which he spoke so highly when in the House on Hth April last year he said: The advances made possible by ihis BiU, in Migrants are eligible for free insurance for The advances made possible by ihis BiU, conjunction with tbe other improvements introonly 2 months. So what we are talking conjunction with tbe other improvements duced by this Government in 1963 and 1969, will about is an inflated figure that pretends duced by this Government in 1963 and 1969, bring nnancial protection against the costs of medical and hospital treatment within the reach that long term cover is being given to a medical and hospital treatment within the of every person in the community. Some claim. Little wonder, then, that in munity. That is not the case. Some claim. Little wonder, then, answering a question last Tuesday, he fell back on the claim that the number of low beneficiaries-wh o also make up the back on the claim that the number of income families receiving benefit under the 84,000 claimed by the Minister-wer e income families receiving benefit under scheme was not in fact 13,000; instead he women. They were receiving benefits and scheme was not in fact 13,000; instead said it was 84,000. Let us see just how insurance cover for less than 3 months. said it was 84,000. Let us see just how fraudulent this claim is. Firstly, the figures Let us consider those who are specifically fraudulent this claim is. Firstly, the figures given by the Minister relate to people who low income families, who receive the minigiven by the Minister relate to people who signed up with a health benefits organisamum wage or up to $6 more than that. signed up with a health benefits organisamum tion in the course of a whole year. These Here we find from page 64 of the report tion in the course of a whole year. These include migrants, families on a specifically of the Department of Social Services that include migrants, families on a specifically low income and people receiving unem57 per cent of all the families in the low income and people receiving unem57 ployment, sickness or special benefit from categories of class A, class B and class C ployment, sickness or special benefit from the Commonwealth. Had the Minister been had been enrolled in the subsidised local the Commonwealth. Had the Minister been honest enough to examine the number of scheme for more than 6 months. So only a honest enough to examine the number of people registered with a health benefits tiny majority of the people who were people registered with a health benefits organisation at a given time he would have members of the whole scheme were organisation at a given time he would admitted that as at 30th June of this year covered for any significant period. Let us admitted that as at 30th June of this year a total of only 21,000 members were regisdispel the cloud of confusion that the a total of only 21,000 members were regisdispel tered with a hospital benefits organisation Ministers have deliberately thrown around tered with a hospital benefits organisation and only about 22,000 were registered with the claim that the 84,000 supposedly and only about 22,000 were registered a medical benefits organisation. This is the included within their scheme are' actually a medical benefits organisation. This is reality as to how many of these people low income families. If this is supposed to reality as to how many of these people were covered as at 30th June of this year, mean that they are people on long term were covered as at 30th June of this year, not how many were covered in and out of low incomes of less than $52.50 a week not how many were covered in and out one continuous year. So we can see that then let us see what follows. one continuous year. So we can see the figure which the Minister used in claiming that there were 84,000 low income families inflates the success of the suggestion that two-thirds of those enrolled income families inflates the success of the scheme by about 300 per cent. The second point to bear in mind when 300,000 applications passed by the ComThe second point to bear in mind when looking at the Minister'sfiguresis that the monwealth Government last year as eligilooking at the Minister'sfiguresis that great majority of people referred to in the ble for assistance, probably 200,000 should great majority of people referred to in the figure of 84,000 derived only a short term have been chronically low income families. figure of 84,000 derived only a short term benefit from the scheme. One expects that If that were the case, the number regisbenefit from the scheme. One expects that a scheme aimed at protecting low income tered in 1970 as specifically low income a scheme aimed at protecting low income families would be for a long term. We are families should not have been 13,000 but a families would be for a long term. We are talking about low income over a long far greater figure. But that did not happen. talking about low income over a long far period-chronicall y low wages and low livWhat we are talking about in the groups period-chronicall y low wages and low ing standards. But in fact probably 40 per outside class A, class B and class C, the ing standards. But in fact probably 40 per cent of the males receiving unemployment specifically low income groups, are people cent of the males receiving unemployment benefit, referred to by the Minister in that some of whom are on low incomes, but benefit, referred to by the Minister in figure of 84,000, were receiving it for less not all of them and not even a significant figure of 84,000, were receiving it for less than one month, and probably about 80 number of them. Likewise, only 25 per than one month, and probably about per cent were receiving it for less than 3 cent of the migrants arriving last year per cent were receiving it for less than months. This evidence is suggested on page enrolled with the private benefits organisamonths. This evidence is suggested on page 59 of the annual report for the Departtions during their 2 months eligibility. 59 of the annual report for the Departtions ment of Social Services this year. These migrants were likely to be from the ment of Social Services this year. These 20369/71-/S-I66 ] Similarly, probably 52 per cent of the males receiving sickness benefit had been receiving it for less than 3 months. in Migrants are eligible for free insurance for introonly 2 months. So what we are talking will about is an inflated figure that pretends reach that long term cover is being given to a significant number of people in the comthat in munity. That is not the case. The vast majority of special low beneficiaries-wh o also make up the the 84,000 claimed by the Minister-wer e he women. They were receiving benefits and insurance cover for less than 3 months. Let us consider those who are specifically low income families, who receive the miniwage or up to $6 more than that. Here we find from page 64 of the report of the Department of Social Services that per cent of all the families in the categories of class A, class B and class C had been enrolled in the subsidised local scheme for more than 6 months. So only a tiny majority of the people who were have members of the whole scheme were covered for any significant period. Let us the cloud of confusion that the Ministers have deliberately thrown around with the claim that the 84,000 supposedly the included within their scheme are' actually low income families. If this is supposed to mean that they are people on long term of low incomes of less than $52.50 a week that then let us see what follows. For one thing, using the Government's suggestion that two-thirds of those enrolled in benefits organisationsare low income families and individuals, then of all the 300,000 applications passed by the Comthe monwealth Government last year as eligible for assistance, probably 200,000 should have been chronically low income families. If that were the case, the number registered in 1970 as specifically low income families should not have been 13,000 but a greater figure. But that did not happen. livWhat we are talking about in the groups outside class A, class B and class C, the specifically low income groups, are people that some of whom are on low incomes, but not all of them and not even a significant 80 number of them. Likewise, only 25 per 3 cent of the migrants arriving last year enrolled with the private benefits organisaduring their 2 months eligibility. migrants were likely to be from the English speaking countries and on incomes the majority of people in the scheme are English speaking countries and on incomes probably higher than $52.50. Thus, the women, because they earn far less and are probably higher than $52.50. Thus, the low income earners, particularly from relying on State government subsidies. low income earners, particularly from Greece and Italy, were likely to be in that group which did not register with a cases of genuine hardship that this scheme group which did not register with a cases benefits organisation. Again, only 40 per cent of the unemThis scheme will not work. The only way Again, only 40 per cent of the unemThis ployment, sickness and special beneficiaries in which it is possible to insure-every perployment, sickness and special beneficiaries registered with a benefits organisation. It a national health insurance scheme in registered with a benefits organisation. can reasonably be argued that the very low which people are insured through their pay can reasonably be argued that the very low income earners in these categories are packets. The scheme cannot possibly work income earners in these categories are more likely to be found in the 60 per cent in relation to aborigines. Living in the more likely to be found in the 60 per cent of those who did not register with a fringe areas of the south west of Western of those who did not register with a benefits organisation than among the 40 Australia are probably 6,000 to 7,000 benefits organisation than among the per cent who did. lt is clear that this sysaboriginals.

One thing that is most turbing is the very small number of famisidised medical scheme came in, it turbing is the very small number of lies led by adult male wage earners that replaced that system. I understand that lies led by adult male wage earners that are covered in this scheme. At 30th June now there are fewer than 1,000 aborigines are covered in this scheme. At 30th June Ihis year there were probably no more covered. than 2,000 families led by male wage earners in this subsidised scheme, in the - Order !

The interesting thing about the group of people in the less than $46.50 a tance I must say that the wording of the group of people in the less than $46.50 week income bracket who have registered proposal for discussion and the points week income bracket who have registered is, as the Department of Social Services raised indicate that again it appears to be is, as the Department of Social Services report indicates, that 6 out of 10 families an example of political opportunism rather report indicates, that 6 out of 10 families registered are families led by women and, than of actual facts.

What are finding is that many males'in Australia low income benefits and referred, as the are finding is that many males'in Australia simply could not afford to lead a family on basis for authority for his comments, to simply could not afford to lead a family the means test involved in this system. So recent Press statements which alleged that the means test involved in this system. the majority of people in the scheme are women, because they earn far less and are relying on State government subsidies. I would like to refer to a number of of genuine hardship that this scheme overlooks. Let me say one thing for sure. scheme will not work. The only way in which it is possible to insure-every person in the Australian community is to have It a national health insurance scheme in which people are insured through their pay packets. The scheme cannot possibly work in relation to aborigines. Living in the fringe areas of the south west of Western 40 Australia are probably 6,000 to 7,000 sysaboriginals. They were formerly provided of for by a Government grant of about $20,000 a year made to doctors to care for disthe health of aborigines. When this subfamisidised medical scheme came in, it replaced that system. I understand that now there are fewer than 1,000 aborigines Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mr Corbett) the - Order ! The honourable member's time Mr SWARTZ (Darling Downs-Ministe r for National Development) (5.6)-Befor e with the points raised by the honin this ourable member for Bendigo ( Mr Kennedy) I would like to thank my colleague the honourable member for Oxley ( Mr Hayden) for indicating that the Opposition will be prepared to give leave to the Prime Minister ( Mr MCMahon) to make a statement at 8 o'clock this evening on a matter relating to increased benefits for nursing homes. Copies of the statement will be available shortly and will be passed adeon to the Opposition in accordance with the usual arrangement. I appreciate the in Opposition's indicating in advance that it will give leave for that statement to be The honourable member fpr Bendigo raised a matter of great importance. Whilst I agree that it is a matter of great impora tance I must say that the wording of the proposal for discussion and the points raised indicate that again it appears to be an example of political opportunism rather than of actual facts. The honourable memwe ber criticised, amongst Other things, the low income benefits and referred, as the on basis for authority for his comments, to So recent Press statements which alleged that because by 31st December 1970 only about 12,000 low income families had applied for assistance under the subsidised health benefits plan, which was introduced on lst Januay last year, the plan had failed in its objective. But of course this is not so. I feel that misunderstanding has occurred in the use of published statistics relating to the scheme, and that the Opposition in this case has chosen to perpetuate the error. Consequently it is necessary for me to put thesefiguresin their proper perspective. For administrative and statistical purposes beneficiaries under the plan are divided into 3 separate community groups eligible for assistance. They are, firstly, the for all beneficiaries, whether low income eligible for assistance. They are, firstly, low income families; secondly, unemployment, sickness and special beneficiaries; and, thirdly, migrants. These groups are not mutually exclusive. A high proportion of the persons receiving unemployment, sickness and special benefits would receive annual incomes less than the annual limit of income which determines eligibility for low income families. Similarly, in a 12 months period migrants on the average would be in Australia for only 6 months and their annual income would also be less than the limit. For income assessment statistical purposes beneficiaries in all these 3 groups would be classified as low income earners. For the purpose of the subsidised health benefits plan the 3 groups have been recorded separately. In the year ended 30th June 1971, 82,000 unemployment, sickness and special beneficiaries became members of health insurance funds, about 11,000 low income families became members and about 28,000 migrants became members. The total of the 3 groups approximates 121,000. lt is estimated that 84,000 of these consist of families on low incomes. It is also relevant that the original estimate was that 184,000 families would become eligible for health insurance assistance. This estimate was based on figures for the year 1966-67, which were the latest figures available at that time. Mr Hayden-Hav e these figures been updated? Mr SWARTZ-The y have subsequently been updated, and the figures I will mentralia's health scheme have taken much of been updated, and the figures I will mentralia's tion shortly will show the result. But the the worry out of health costs for people on tion shortly will show the result. But the figures I have quoted were the up to date low incomes. If a family incoine is below figures I have quoted were the up to date figures at that time. The original estimates were based on figures for the year 196667. Projections based on figures for the 1968-69 income year, which are now available, indicate that by now the maximum number of eligible low income families is approximately 125,000. Notwithstanding this, the Commonwealth Deportment of Health has not been idle in facing the situation and revised procedures to operate from 1st November 1971 will make a very real contribution towards some of the problems being experienced. The new procedures involve the introduction of a simplified application form of low income families and the adoption of one certificate the for all beneficiaries, whether low income families or unemployment, sickness or special beneficiaries. These new arrangements will simplify procedures and enable more eligible persons to avail themselves of the assistance under the plan. The Department has also adopted widespread measures in publicising the plan, both in campaigns directed solely to tbe operation of the plan and its inclusion in other general departmental literature. However, it has been found that publicity efforts directed through the normal media do not reach a great number of those eligible. At the present time the Department of Health is examining suitable avenues, such as more use of social workers in the communiy, to support the normal publicity measures. A factor indicating the success of the scheme is the expenditure under it to date. During the first financial year of the operation of the plan, that is, lst July 1970 to 30th June 1971, expenditure was $6.9m. It is estimated that the expenditure for 1971-72 will rise to $9.7m. I think the House will agree that these figures alone completely refute the allegations of the honourable member for Bendigo. But I think I would be performing a useful-an d factual-servic e if 1 were briefly to outline certain aspects of the health benefits plan as they apply to low income families, to those receiving unemployment, sickness or special benefits, and to migrant settlers for medical or hospital expenses incurred during the first 2 months in Australia. Benefits now available through Aushealth scheme have taken much of the worry out of health costs for people on low incomes. If a family incoine is below $52.51 a week, lhe plan gives special help in paying health expenses. There are 3 categories of assistance: Firstly, where a family income is $46.50 or less, free medical benefits and public ward hospital cover are available; secondly, where a family income is above $46.50 but does not exceed $49.50, medical benefits and public ward hospital cover are available for only one-third of the normal cost of health insurance contributions; and thirdly, where a family income is above $49.50 but does not exceed $52.50 medical benefits and public ward hospital cover are available for two-thirds of the normal cost of health insurance contributions. Also, if a person is receiving unemployment, sickness or special benefits, he is eliOpposition's case is regrettably lacking in ment, sickness or special benefits, he is gible for full medical benefits and a scale of hospital benefits equal to the charge made to patients in public wards of public hospitals. He does not have to complete a special application form to receive these benefits. A subsidised medical services entitlement certificate is issued automatically and he should receive this soon after being granted his social service benefits. A person is allowed 4 weeks free health insurance after his unemployment, sickness or special benefits terminate to allow him time to become a regular contributor to a health insurance fund of his own choice. And finally, if a person is a migrant who intends to settle in Australia, the Federal Government will provide special assistance towards meeting any medical or hospital costs he may bave during the first 2 months following his arrival. To qualify for this benefit he must first become a member of a health insurance fund and begin paying contributions. He must present the insurance fund with an identification paper, such as his passport or document of identity, which shows the date of his arrival in Australia. The fund will pay benefits, on behalf of the Federal Government, towards his medical and hospital costs for the first 2 months of his res2550 which was supplied to the honourable pital costs for the first 2 months of his idence in Australia. He will be entitled to full medical benefits and a scale of hospital benefits equal to the charge made to patients in public wards of public hospitals. I mention these things because they are inherent in the Opposition's matter of public importance and because they are facts of achievement and service under the national health benefits plan, which everyone in Australia should know. The points that have been raised by the hon* ourable member for Bendigo dealt with factual situations in perspective as placed before the public by Press reports which, as I indicated, have been based mainly on outdated figures. The facts and figures I have quoted this afternoon show the. position in perspective in accordance with the latest statistics that are available and indicate, as I have indicated today, the amount of finance that has been provided by the Government in the past year, and the estimates for this year show that it is being substantially taken up by a large number of people classified as being in the' low income group. Ih conclusion, the' eliOpposition's case is regrettably lacking in facts and does a most rational and enlightened national scheme a grave disservice. Mr HAYDEN (Oxley) (5.18)-Th e hon-. ourable member for Bendigo ( Mr Kennedy) is to be commended for his diligence and industry in exposing the almost total failure of the Government's subsidised health insurance scheme. He did this well before the data in the annual report of the Department of Health was released publicly. Nothing which the Minister for National Development ( Mr Swartz), who has just spoken, has said in any way. diminishes the impact of the challenge issued by the honourable member for Bendigo. The Minister quoted the figure of 11,000 as the number of low income earners obtaining the benefitsof this scheme,. according to latest data. I doubt very much whether that 11,000 would show a great improvement on the figure of a little over 11,000 quoted for the calendar year ended 31st December 1970 as distinct from the figure for the financial year that he quotes, which is a figure for only a further 6 months. The answer to question on notice No res2550 which was supplied to the honourable member for Bendigo shows that this figure of 11,000 can be quite grievously misleading, lt represents double counting, because when one looks at the breakup of membership of health insurance organisations for low income families one finds that it is a total figure covering people registered, in the first place, for medical insurance and, in the second place, for hospital insurance. In each case, for instance under class A, only a little over 5,000 families are registered. So what in fact has happened is that the Government has lumped a little over 5,000 together twice and said that this is 11,000 families, but in fact this is double counting and it is fairly obvious that the families drawing on low income medical insurance are the same families appearing under hospital insurance claims, and similarly for the other groups-th e migrant groups and the unemployment and sickness beneficiaries. That is the first point I make. The next point I wish to make concerns the Minister's reference to the diminution in the number of people who will be drawing on the benefits of the subsidised, health insurance scheme. This was a diminution from 184,000 to 125,000. What he neglected to mention is the fact that this has been achieved by freezing the income bands which establish eligibility for people who wish to draw on this scheme. Class A beneficiaries are people whose income reaches a maximum of $46.50. If that income level had been increased since it was last set according to average weekly earnings it would now stand at $50.80. The income band of a class B beneficiary stands between $46.50 and. $49.50. Again, if that band had been increased according to increases in average weekly earnings in the period since then the band would be $50.80 to $54.08. Similarly, class C is $49.50 to $52.50. If that band had been increased it too would have been raised to a level of $54.08 to $57.36. So those are the facts. The Government is squeezing people out of the benefits of this scheme by freezing the income band which provides eligibility for the people who want to draw on the scheme. Of course, the people who are drawing on the scheme represent an even more despairing group of socially and economically deprived people. The Minister referred to a cost increase from $6m to $9m, but as my colleague the honourable member for Bendigo reminded me a few moments ago, the estimate of the Government when the scheme was amended a few months after it was first proposed exceeded Slim so in fact the Government'is making an obvious saving here. I want to say something about that soon. Finally, the simple form and the single certificate will not solve this problem. As the honourable member for Bendigo said, we need a universal health insurance scheme to do this. After a bare 18 months the scheme for subsidised health insurance cover for low income earners is a shambles. It is, characteristically, extravagantly expensive for the taxpayer and at the same time a dismal failure as a vehicle for the provision of insurance cover for low income earners. Fewer than 4 families out of every 100 low income families entitled to draw on this scheme have done so. Only one out of 5 migrants and 2 out of 5 unemployment and sickness beneficiaries, similarly entitled to draw on this scheme, have done so. Only the stout-hearted would persevere with the complexity of procedures necessary to obtain benefits under the scheme. What is not appreciated are the grave cultural factors at work, which deter people from drawing on the benefits of this scheme. It is because of this that the sort of concept that the Government has in mind, even in its amended form, will fail, and I repeat that it is because of this we need a universal scheme which will automatically give these people cover. I want to refer quickly to cost because this is an important aspect. According to the annual report of the Department of Health the scheme cost marginally over $7m. In fact, if fully utilised, its cost would have exceeded $ 14.7m. This costing is on the assumption that utilisation rates of hospital and medical services by low income earners is consistent with average rates in the community. In fact, what evidence is available suggests that the health needs of these people are probably greater than the community mean for the simple reason that social and economic disadvantages cause these needs to be neglected and to worsen. In any event, the cost to the Government, covering the equivalent of fund benefit payments, if its scheme had been fully taken up by those it was supposed to help, would have exceeded $10m- a substantially greater sum than that disclosed in the annual report of the Department of Health. To this must be added the portion of medical costs met by patients-a t least $2.9m. Then there must also be added contribution rates to health insurance funds borne by classes B and C of the low income categories. This would be a further $1.8m. I repeat: The true cost of this scheme, not including the Commonwealth medical and hospital subsidies, is in excess of $14.7m. It is readily seen, therefore, that there has been a substantial bonus for the Government in making its scheme so complex, under-publicised and odiously related to a public means testing inquiry to establish beyond all doubt that the recipient is a failure in our society according to prevailing values. Let me contrast this with Labor's proposals. Our universal health insurance plan is well publicised. I deal only with the aspects of subsidised protection for low income earners. For a cost in 1970-71 of COMPARISON OF A.L.P. AND GOVERNMENT SUBSIDISED HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEMES COMPARISON OF A.L.P. AND GOVERNMENT FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES BASED ON YEAR 1970-71 FOR LOW INCOME Family size-Ma n and wife, plusOne child .. ... Two children .. Three children Four children .. Five children Six children (a) Based on New South Wales medical and publ ic ward weekly contribution rale of $1.66 a week. (a) Based on New South Wales medical and publ Let me put the comparison in a nutshell. Labor's scheme will cost about one-third of the Government's scheme for subsidised health insurance, but it will cover nearly twice as many families-abou t 325,000 families. The total cost of Labor's scheme includes an assumption, in making calculations, that there will be as high a degree of doctor participation in billing the proposed health insurance commission direct for services rendered to low income beneficiaries as the Canadian health insurance programme has enjoyed in general support from doctors. In fact, however, insofar as medical services are concerned under this programme one would expect tbat doctors would bill the commission direst in 100 per cent of such cases. Aaeordingly, the figure for cost of Labor's sehtne overabout $4.6m, Labor's scheme would fully meet the cost of all contributions for all low income families with one or more dependants on a taxable income of up to $1,730. In approximate terms, this means a husband supporting a wife and one child on actual income of $2,250 would be fully covered by our programme. An allowance of actual annual income of $156 would be allowed for each additional child. The following table outlines some examples of the comparative situation for low income earners under Labor's programme viz-a-viz the Government's scheme. With the concurrence of honourable members I incorporate it in Hansard.

There would be no odious, prying means testing. Contributions would be made for employees by employers on a system similar to the pay as you earn income tax system. Therefore, any family with at least one dependant with a taxable income below $1,730 would be automatically exempted from contributing but would have full access for free public or standard ward hospital treatment and for medical services from a private doctor of the patient's choosing, Importantly, those most luckless of all Australians-th e Aborigines-woul d be fully covered. In sum, then, the Government's subsidised health insurance scheme has failed miserably. It is a cruel - parody at the expense of deprived and disadvantaged minority groups. It is a further symptom of the inappropriateness and of the excessively costly and inefficient so called volun- scheme was introduced in July 1970 it was sively costly and inefficient so called voluntary health insurance scheme which the Government is determined to impose on the public at too great expense to contributors and taxpayers in terms of the services offered. Mr HAMER (Isaacs) (5.27)^This debate is typical of the Opposition's approach to social problems. It can be summed up as 'Let Big Brother do it'. If one is prepared to ignore long experience of the costs and results of over-centralised administration and the facts of human nature one can make a plausible case for a compulsory comprehensive medical care programme. But reality destroys this superficially plausible case. Take Britain, for example, fn theory the capitation system of medical care- a system 1 am sure the Labor Party would like to introduce here, despite its denials-shoul d encourage preventive treatment and improve genera! medical care. In practice it does no such thing, as the many refugees from Britain's health scheme now living in Australia will attest. The problem of how to Mft people living near the poverty line out of that state is one that is vexing all affluent societies. We must somehow break the cult of poverty. We must help these people to help themselves, not merely to wait for another government handout. The subsidised health benefits plan is fully in accordance with these principles. Low-income families make application to the Department of Social Services where eligibility is assessed and a certificate issued. They then present this certificate to a fund where they are enrolled as members and accredited with all or part of their contributions. The date of eligibility is the date the application is lodged with the Department of Social Services. On each occasion they incur medical or hospital expenses they submit a claim to their fund in the normal way. I submit that these are reasonable requirements. I accept that many of the low-income families are poorly educated and some must perhaps be helped in taking these steps, but this is much better than converting it into another government handout. The honourable member for Bendigo ( Mr Kennedy) made much play of the low proportion of those eligible wbo are receiving benefits. It is worth while examining these figures in a little more detail. When the graduated scheme was introduced in July 1970 it was estimated that 184,000 families would be eligible for assistance. As the Minister pointed out, these estimates were based on taxation statistics for the income year 1966-67 as those were the latest figures available at the time. The figures represented the maximum number of lowincome families which could become eligible for the assistance available. Since then, the income levels of eligibility for assistance have been adjusted to keep pace with the cost of living. Yet, the effect of the rising prosperity of this country is that the number estimated to qualify for this assistance fell to 152,000 in 1968-69 and may well have fallen to 125,000 by 1970-71. I should have thought that this evidence of a reduction in poverty would have delighted the honourable member for Oxley, but he seems to conceal his pleasure very well. A further factor is that free hospital and medical treatment is available in Queensland. Families in that State, therefore, would not need to enrol under the subsidised health benefits plan. This would reduce the estimated number of eligible families to about 110,000 instead of 180,000 as mentioned by the honourable member for Bendigo. Still, I do not suppose that he will be too worried about an error of 40 per cent. Why have not all of the 110,000 eligible persons applied for assistance? The answer seems to lie in the nature of the people whom the plan is designed to assist. They do not apply for assistance until they need medical or hospital care. It is probable that a large number of eligible families have not applied for assistance because they have not needed hospital or medical treatment. This view is supported by the fact that only 30 per cent of contributors insured with hospital benefits fund in the normal way claim benefits in any one year. Hospital treatment would be the greatest cost incurred by low income families as they would be accustomed to receiving medical treatment in the out-patient's departments of public hospitals and most probably would continue to do so. These people therefore would not seek assistance until they were hospitalised. The Government is paying the insurance funds the costs of benefits actually paid rather than paying contributions. Because of this fact, if an eligible but unregistered low income very concept of the Government taking on if an eligible but unregistered low income earner is hospitalised his benefits are paid a national health insurance scheme for all earner is hospitalised his benefits are paid without the normal waiting period of 2 wage earners. without the normal waiting period of 2 wage earners. months imposed by the funds.

How are these people to process the claims of 180,000 people or 120,000 people who may contact them? Some of them are itinerant workers, Aboriginal workers or rural workers. How are they to contact them to tell them about this scheme? The result is that about 2 per cent of those eligible enrol. Six per cent of people in the class A category-the y are the people who are granted full membership without any waiting period-enrolled , but only 1 per cent of class B persons-tha t is, those who have to pay part of the membership charges themselves and who therefore must wait for 2 months to become eligible for benefits-enrolled .

Under the scheme in Western Australia that Government gave the AMA £9,000 a year to provide free services for fringe dwelling Aborigines in the south-west of that State. That amount covered about 35 per cent of fees owing to doctors. At the end of a year the doctors would total the amounts owing to them by Aborigines and, as I said, the return on fees owing was about 35 per cent. That grant was raised to $20,000. That scheme was discontinued by the State Government when the subsidised medical scheme was introduced. The State Government said that the Aborigines would be all right as the Federal Government would make them members of medical funds, but is it did not work out that way. The AMA contacted the State Government and the State Government contacted the Department of Social Services and the purDepartment of Health in Canberra stating about that it was not working and with the eligirequest that the Commonwealth continue so to subsidise Western Australia under the scheme whereby it provided medical seris vices to Aborigines. The Commonwealth resaid: 'Oh no, the scheme was never intended to cover these people because so some of the Aborigines might be earning too much and they would not come within the provisions of the scheme. We cannot do it that way.' There was a lot of correof spondence and consultations between the eliDepartment of Native Welfare and the of Department of Health in Western Australia, the AMA and the Commonwealth departments concerned. I have no doubt that the Minister will be very happy lo table this correspondence for the information of honourable members. If not the has assured us that it will provide it. I cannot deal with every section of the miscommunity involved in this scheme or the problems which are involved. The problems are multiple. The people I am referto very often do not have the educational or intellectual capacity, the time, the money or the emotional serenity because their poverty to go into the Department Social Services and work out their average earnings. Some of them could be unemployed for a major part of the year. They cannot work out their gross earnings over a year. They do not know whether they are eligible to receive benefits, under the Government scheme. When they go to the Department of Social Services and get their cards a lot of them turn up at the doctors' surgeries, hand in their cards and say ' I am entitled to free treatment.' But the doctors say: 'You cannot bring this card here. You have to go to the fund.' These people cannot comprehend this. They cannot comprehend why they have to put in a claim for the medical services to a medical fund, bring the cheque back and give it to the doctor and obtain a receipt. Why all this rot? This whole scheme is not an insurance scheme; it is a misnomer because in these circumstances the funds are merely acting as enrolling agents for the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth pays the whole of Australia. The Commonwealth pays the whole of Australia. benefit on the doctor's fee. The beneficiary who does not pay his contribution to a medical fund and who is not required to benefit plan now under debate is, I believe, medical fund and who is not required to undergo a waiting period is covered by the a part of that overall responsibility. One undergo a waiting period is covered by the Commonwealth not only for the Commoncould not expect that all those eligible for Commonwealth not only for the Commoncould wealth benefit but also for the fund assistance under the scheme would enrol in wealth benefit but also for the fund benefit. We have this Big Brother attitude the first year or in the first 2 years of its benefit. We have this Big Brother attitude that was condemned by the honourable operation. Obviously in a new scheme in a that was condemned by the honourable member for Isaacs. Why hot do it in a large nation such as ours it takes some member for Isaacs. Why hot do it in simple way? We could give a person a time before the people become aware pf simple way? We could give a person medical entitlement card straight off, as the benefits to which they are entitled. My medical entitlement card straight off, as is done when a person becomes a penown experience in this field is that those is done when a person becomes a penown sioner. Is it wrong for Big Brother to people who have not taken the opportunity sioner. Is it wrong for Big Brother to help someone in a simple. way to cut to participate in this scheme until such help someone in a simple. way to cut through red tape and prevent unnecessary expense?

Mr HALLETT (Canning) (4.44)-Th e people will take advantage of the proviMr HALLETT (Canning) (4.44)-Th e Opposition has introduced this matter of sions of this plan. In 1970-71 the ComOpposition has introduced this matter public importance in these terms consisting monwealth paid out $6.9m under the public importance in these terms consisting of exactly 8 words: The failure of the Government's subsidised medical scheme. It is really not possible to single out any particular area and divorce it from the total medical scheme which has been introduced over the years by this Government. The present medical scheme has been in operation only since 1970-las t year. The figures indicate that the scheme now covers a very large number of people. Ih this Budget it is estimated that an amount of $504.6m will be expended this year on health services over a wide range of activities in assisting the people of Australia to overcome their health problems which is, as everybody will admit, a great responsibility not only of the Commonwealth Government but also of the State governments, which have their part to play in the overall health of the people of Australia. The Commonwealth does its part in making available this large amount of money through many avenues to assist the people The Government's subsidised health benefit plan now under debate is, I believe, a part of that overall responsibility. One not expect that all those eligible for assistance under the scheme would enrol in the first year or in the first 2 years of its operation. Obviously in a new scheme in a a large nation such as ours it takes some a time before the people become aware pf the benefits to which they are entitled. My experience in this field is that those people who have not taken the opportunity to participate in this scheme until such time as they have gone into hospital-'hav to ing found out at that point of time that they were entitled to participate in the scheme-hav e been extremely pleased to learn that the scheme was available to The Government has for some time but I spent quite a considerable amount of money in an endeavour to bring to the notice of the people of this country the provision of this scheme. I have no doubt that the Government will continue to disseminate this information and that in time people will take advantage of the proviof sions of this plan. In 1970-71 the Commonwealth paid out $6.9m under the scheme and it is estimated that it will pay out $9.7m in 1971-72. So it can be seen that there has been a substantial increase in the amount of money to be paid out by the Commonwealth for improved health services. Mention was made of where hospitals lit into this plan. One honourable member on the other side said too much work would be involved in ascertaining the position of social workers. 1 have no doubt that the hospitals welcome this scheme. They welcome it with open arms because it assists them. Of course, h assists the patients of those hospitals. This scheme was designed to assist the needy people of Australia. But at the same time 1 point out that the people involved in treating patients in hospitals throughout Australia would no doubt also benefit from the provisions of this scheme. This plan is an extension of the medical services in this country. From what I know of it I have no doubt that it is worth while and it will continue to be worth while. The scheme has been upgraded in the one year that it has been in operation. The amount of money available in the 3 categories of eligibility for assistance has which this Parliament operates, as bas been 3 categories of eligibility for assistance been increased. I have no doubt that the Government will from time to time make adjustments to this scheme. I am sure that this scheme will be much sought after by those people who are eligible to receive benefits. A matter which is a worry to many people in Australia, especially the family man, is the cost of health services. This scheme is designed to help families which are in a low income bracket. When these people realise that this scheme is available to them I do not doubt that they will take advantage of it because the cost of health services is a great worry lo the people of Australia. The Budget this year, like those which preceded it, has been designed to help those in need. That is the first obligation of this Government as I see it. In relation to pensioners this is so. In many other areas where an amount of money is made available each year by the Commonwealth and also, I believe, by the States it is a fact of life that the object is to assist those people in the greatest need. Surely the health service which we are debating this afternoon is one in which we should assist those who need assistance. It is a very practical operation to do just that - Order l This discussion has now operation to do just that - Order l This discussion has now I have not as yet heard from tho Opposition a real argument for raising this question this afternoon. As I have stated previously, the figures indicate to me that there has been a considerable lift in Commonwealth expenditure from $6.9m in the first year to an estimated $9.7m in the second year. If it continues to lift at this rate and those eligible take up the opportunities under the plan and apply in greater numbers, as is obviously happening at the moment, theh no doubt this is a plan which is working. It helps people who want help so surely it is worth persevering with it. Would the Opposition deny these people, the low income earners in the community, the right to obtain assistance? Would it deny them the right to have access to a scheme such as this? Whether the scheme is being used to its full extent at the moment is another question altogether. The fact Ls that it is being made available by the Commonwealth together with many other health benefits throughout the country. The system under has which this Parliament operates, as bas been shown over the years, requires that all Acts of Parliament must be brought up to date from time to time. This is what Parliament is all about. Acts of Parliament are passed for the benefit of the people, and if there are areas in which these Acts are not doing what they are intended to do the Government will bring in Bills to amend them accordingly. This is part of the Government's responsibility. The basis for this proposal is very sound and if there are areas in which it should be adjusted I have no doubt that the Government will bring an amending Bill into this House-a s it has done, as I have mentioned already, within one year. The Government has adjusted the rates of income within which people receiving those incomes may apply, and this sort of adjustment to any Act is part of Parliament's operation and part of the Government's responsibility. The main thing is that the real basis of any Act must be sound and from my experience as a member of this House I believe that this Act is sound. It can assist many people and many families throughout Australia wbo need assistance. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mr Corbett) concluded. Sitting suspended from 5.53 to 8 p.m. COMMONWEALTH ASSISTANCE FOR NURSING HOME PATIENTS Ministerial Statement Mr MCMAHON (Lowe-Prim e Minister) - b y leave-Fo r some time past now, the Government has been examining the role of nursing homes in caring for the sick aged, their financial position and the extent of Commonwealth financial assistance for all nursing home patients. Over the past five years, the number of nursing home beds has increased from about 33,000 to about 47,000. There is no doubt that this has resulted in a very significant improvement in the care of the sick aged in Australia. The financial assistance provided by the Commonwealth for nursing home patients, which amounted to nearly $50m in 1970-71, has been an important factor contributing to the growth of these homes and to the overall raising of standards of care. The assistance to be provided to those people requiring nursing home care is an extraordinarily complex question. involving consideration of the differing needs and circumstances of patients in various types of homes. These homes are run by State governments as well as by religious and charitable organisations and by private proprietors. As I have indicated, the present arrange- clear that some improvement had to be As I have indicated, the present arrangements relating to the care of, and assistance to, those requiring nursing home treatment have been under review for some time. We are continuing this review with the aim of introducing new long term arrangements as soon as it is practicable to do so. This, of course, will include consultation with State governments as necessary. We recognise that the recent steep increases in running costs, notably in nurses' salaries, has placed if the private sector were to substantially costs, notably in nurses' salaries, has placed many people in an extremely difficult financial position. Those homes relying largely on Commonwealth assistance to patients through benefits or pensions have been hit particularly hard. We have therefore decided, as an interim - measure, to increase nursing home benefits to take effect as soon as the necessary legislation is passed by Parliament and assented to. Benefits for patients receiving ordinary nursing home care will be increased from $2 a day to $3.50 a day or $24.50 a week. Benefits for patients receiving intensive care will be increased from $5 a day to $6.50 a day or $45.50 a week. The cost of these increases will be approximately $24m in a full year. The cost in 1971-72, which will depend on the date of assent to the amending legislation to give effect to the new legislation, will be of the order of $12m to $14m. This action is being taken in accordance with the Government's overall policy of assisting the sick and the aged wherever areas of need exist. Nursing home benefits are only one of the many provisions made by the Commonwealth to help aged persons, and the increase in benefits is to be seen in the context of the substantial assistance we are providing in other ways. I refer to such measures as the age pension and related payments, assistance with aged persons housing and assistance provided through our home care programme. Within the limits necessarily imposed by available resources, it is the policy of the Government to improve progressively the welfare of elderly citizens. I present the following paper: Commonwealth Assistance for Nursing Home Patients-Ministeria l Statement, 5 October 1971. Motion (by Mr Swartz) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Mr HAYDEN (Oxley) (8.4)-I t is quite clear that some improvement had to be made in the subsidy rate which is made available to nursing homes and, of course, it is equally clear that not only had this improvement to be made for the Government and the non-profit making sector but also for the profit making private sector which provides these sorts of services. The simple fact of the current situation is that if the private sector were to substantially close down, as has been claimed by some representatives of that sector, there would be a number of unfortunate patients who would have to go to one does not know where, and that is something which gives one a great deal of concern. Accordingly, more money had to be provided. What is interesting however is the fact that the National Health Bill, which was to have been debated last week, has been withdrawn and, at this point, is in a state of suspension while the situation is ironed out within the Government ranks. It appears that this is further evidence of the division, fragmentation, disputation and general beligerence tbat members of the Government are displaying to one another in contemporary times. I should like to raise some questions about the general concept behind nursing homes because I am far from satisfied that the way in which these services are being conducted is the best way for the community. I am far from satisfied, too, that what has been proposed tonight is a satisfactory answer to the problem of the general provision of services for the aged and invalid. It has sometimes been asserted by Government spokesmen in recent times that Australia has one of the highest provisions in the world of nursing home beds to population. On the face of it, that is an impressive statement. But is it in fact so impressive? I shall deal with why we have this high rate of nursing home beds in a few minutes, but it seems to me that there is mounting evidence that such a high rate of provision may very well be deleterious to the wellbeing, the good health and to the future prospects of aged people. It may well be, and there is substantial evidence in support of this view, that a high rate of investment in nursing home beds in the community leads to a tendency to institutionalise aged people and to push them into beds and leave them there. This applies especially in a situation - thi s is not true in all cases-wher e there is an underdevelopment or no development of nursing services to stimulate the interest of - aged people who resort to these sorts of places. If we are to effectively develop nursing home services for the community, we must back them up with a range of other services, such as hostels. It has been estimated that an adequate provision of hostels, for instance, can reduce the demand on nursing home beds by about 20 per cent. It is obviously cheaper to operate good standard hostels than to load everyone into nursing home beds with, I repeat, the tendency to institutionalise the aged people and to create an unnecessary deterioration in their health. It seems to me that there is a need to provide special finance for family units so that families can extend their homes by the building of self-contained in-law units. By this means there may be a tendency in our Financial Review' of 8th June 1971, this means there may be a tendency in community to get back to the extended quotes the case where company-run community to get back to the extended family unit. One of the sad facts of our nursing homes-privat e nursing homesfamily unit. One of the sad facts of society has been, firstly, the breakdown of the extended family unit and, secondly, as can be seen today, the breakdown of the nuclear family unit. This has grave implications for us, but by providing special finance the family unit can be maintained. By this means, we will avoid institutionalising these aged people. Of course, with domiciliary services, we go well beyond hostels and into the field of home visitors, home maker services, home nursing services and perhaps even to visiting chiropodists. A home visitor can visit these lonely old people and keep them buoyed up, interested in their society and in their environment and so help to delay the erosion of age which otherwise could lead to them suffering mental degeneration and eventual incarceration in some sort of home where there is no stimulation or interest for them. I mentioned earlier that I would raise the question of the significant rate of private enterprise which is operating in lhe field of nursing home services. From the figures available from the annual report of the Commonwealth Department of Health it is to be noted that between the years 1963 and 1971 there has been an increase of one-third in the number of public homes and one-quarter in the number of private homes. But what is more significant is the increase in the provision of beds because in that respect the situation has changed rather radically. The increase in the provision of beds in the public homes has been about one-third but in the private homes it has been more than 100 per cent. Of course, what has taken place is that people are moving out of private hospitals because they are too expensive to run now-the y are not profitable. Increasingly they are sending their more difficult and more expensive lo maintain cases to the public hospitals and are shifting into private nursing homes as a matter of private enterprise and as a matter of profit making. For many people this has been a particularly profitable venture. I have grave doubts whether in our society health or welfare services should be part of the profit making system. Megan Stoyles, in the 'Australian our Financial Review' of 8th June 1971, quotes the case where company-run our nursing homes-privat e nursing homesin their advertisements seeking scriptions have offered dividends of up to 20 per cent. This seems an abnormally high rate. It seems to indicate that these private homes, at least in some cases, are extremely rewarding investments. Again, one has concern about the standards of service which are offered by some of these private homes. I have no doubt that some of them are offering a very high standard of service, but some are not. Some are offering a very grim and depressing sort of condition for the people who are virtually incarcerated in their surroundings. I Mr Donald Cameron-Nam' ; them. Mr HAYDEN- 1 take the case of the New South Wales Nurses Association and meal, order amounted to a mere 2 legs of New South Wales Nurses Association and its published claims, which 1 will enumersausages. its published claims, which 1 will enumersausages. ate for the honourable member for Griffith.

Other homes require an additional payment of $12 to $84 a week above the about the deplorable conditions which were payment of $12 to $84 a week above the pension and above the nursing home raised recently at a social medicine seminar pension and above the nursing home raised subsidy. So quite obviously these sorts of at a hospital in Melbourne where it was subsidy. So quite obviously these sorts homes are beyond the resources of these reported that aged people have returned homes are beyond the resources of these people. There is a skimping on staff. For suffering extreme neglect. For instance, There is a skimping on staff. For example, nurses are doing domestic and kitchen hands work at various times. Patients are frequently left in bed to develop bed sores and they are neglected when they wet the bed. Who is attracted unfortunate patients who were approachwhen they wet the bed. Who is attracted to these services, anyway, in the nursing ing senility wet the bed they had been left to these services, anyway, in the nursing staff area when salaries are about SO per to lie in those sorts of conditions.

They commented on nursing homes and how good are the services proto me also because any one of us could homes and how good are the services vided by the Government for aged people. eventually end up in this sort of situation. vided by the Government for aged people. The attitude of the Liberal Government seems to be that if we provide a few dollars and shove these people out of the hoped the Prime Minister would confront dollars and shove these people out of subway we can forget them because we take the pressure off our backs from the private nursing home lobby. I would like to read to the House 2 quotes from this article which are significant. The journalists are referring to an old woman and state: For she became a profitable unit in one of Sydney's not-so-kindly nursing homes. In this case, a home which was more like a geriatric factory, a house of lingering death, exploited and neglected by profiteering management They added: A good example of how some homes skimp on food for iheir inmates is provided by statistics given by the matron of one home to the New South Wales Nurses Association. To feed 60 patients, plus star), the weekly meal, order amounted to a mere 2 legs of hogget. 40 Ib of mince, 40 chops and 40 All in all, probably enough for a wholesome meal for 60 people at one sitting. But how do you stretch 40 chops and 40 sausages into sufficient meals over 7 days? That is the sort of service we ought ro be talking about. We should be talking about the deplorable conditions which were recently at a social medicine seminar of at a hospital in Melbourne where it was reported that aged people have returned to hospitals from private nursing homes suffering extreme neglect. For instance, their teeth had not been cleaned and their toe nails, which were curling right back into their toes, were in a mess. They were suffering pressure sores and it was well known, of course, that when some of these unfortunate patients who were approaching senility wet the bed they had been left to lie in those sorts of conditions. These are deplorable conditions for people to exist in, in the sort of society that we have at the moment. We can afford far better conditions. We can afford to spend a lot more money on people. We spend too much damn time worrying about how much profit we will make and what sort of progress society will make by measuring this progress in crude material terms and forgetting about the fundamental reason for society and civilisation-tha t is to preserve the right, the dignity and the self-respect of human beings. This situation is deplorable proto me also because any one of us could eventually end up in this sort of situation. These are the sorts of challenges that 1 the hoped the Prime Minister would confront tonight. I hoped that he would indicate how his Government would apply conditions which would prevent this sort of thing happening, not in 12 months time, but in the next few weeks. Let me move on quickly to the people who argue about fhe return they are getting from the private homes. I am not too sure just how unprofitable or otherwise these private homes are. I have no doubt that some homes are unprofitable, but on the sort of evidence Miss Stoyles bas produced in her excellent series of articles on nursing homes it is quite clear that at least not so long ago, and probably currently, many nursing home services have been particularly profitable. There is, however, a reason why some nursing home services have hot been profitable. This is related to a matter of economies of scale. According to the article which Miss Stoyles has written, the average number of beds in nursing homes is about twenty-nine. That number, on the sort of statement made by Mr Stuart L. Kerry, who is the Superintendent of the Presbyterian Social Service Department, which appeared in the journal 'Social Service' of May/June 1970, is a quite insufficient provision for homes if minimum costs are going to be covered. He quotes: Nursing homes may be run at present as an economic unit provided tbey have 40 or more beds. It may be possible to make smaller nursing homes pay but where, as wilh most voluntary organisations, you are catering largely for penorganisations, you are catering largely for pensioners, it is generally not possible to break even cases relations have been forced to pay sioners, it is generally not possible to break with less than 40 beds, unless the nursing home has a fair proportion of intensive care patients. The point is, of course, that if non-profitmaking organisations cannot make it pay it is quite clear that profitmaking organisations would be in a far more difficult position. We get to a sort of dairy industry situation where the least efficient units are demanding that they be recognised as a basis on which profitability sbould be established so that the very profitable organisations-th e bigger ones and the company groups-ar e the ones that will derive generous rewardsfrom any sort of substantial increase in the sort of benefits which will be provided. I want to raise another question. I refer to the proposal to increase the subsidy for the intensive care patients. It has been asserted quite bluntly in the paper I referred to from the seminar on social medicine in Melbourne held only a week or so ago-an d I am prepared to provide a copy of it for the information of the Prime Minister-tha t at some nursing homes there is evidence of aged people who have been sedated so that the intensive care subsidy will continue for them. This is a scandalous situation. I want to make it clear that I do not believe that this is happening in all cases but it is certainly happening in some cases. What ought to be done to prevent that sort of thing is the introduction of a rapidly accelerated programme of getting intensive care patients out of these homes into government institutions or perhaps into non-profitmaking homes run by churches and other charitable groups so that this sort of deplorable practice can be eliminated. I am of the opinion in any event that in the long term we ought to try to establish an adequate provision of nursing homes in the public sector and in the nonprofitmaking private sector, backed up by domiciliary services on a comprehensive basis in thc community plus hostels so that there will be no opportunity for these scavengers in the nursing home business, and 1 would hope that they are only a minority. However, on the evidence I have quoted, they seem to be a substantial number who have been exploiting unfortunate aged people and who, additionally, have been exploiting their relations. In many even cases relations have been forced to pay anything from $12 to $80 extra a week to keep aged people in these homes. (Extension of time granted.) I thank the Prime Minister for his courtesy in this respect. I want to come to the question of just how helpful the proposed increases in the subsidy for nursing homes will be. For instance, the increase of $1.50 a day over the current rate for general bed subsidies will amount to an additional $10.50 a week. But on tbe sort offiguresI.have been able to take out, I find, for instance, that in the case of South Australia, Matron Blundell is quoted in the 'Advertiser' of 18th September 1971 as saying that. relatives are paying upwards-and1 want to stress the word 'upwards'-o f $20 a week. Mr Foster-An d more. Mr HAYDEN-'Upwards ' means 'and more'. Relatives are paying upwards of $20 a week above the pension rate, the supplementary assistance and the daily bed subsidy in order to keep age people in homes. This means that they still have to raise $7.50 a week to meet the cost. But what is obvious is that many of these nursing homes will take the opportunity, as soon as this increase is granted, to up their charges. They have been complaining that they are in a fairly difficult financial posisome sort of information which was an they are in a fairly difficult financial tion. I suspect that this increase will mean no relief at all for many-i f not allpeople who are in the private profit making sector of nursing homes. I repeat that this is no way in which these services ought to be provided. Earlier I started to mention- I curtailed it because I suspected that I would have to conclude my speech-th e sort of development of services which is absolutely essential, in my opinion, if we are going to be responsible and humane in our approach not only to the needs but also the rights of every human being in our society. I am talking about aged people. I should like to go beyond the bland statement of the development of domiciliary services and the bland or general statement of the provision of nursing homes in the government sector, the non-profit making sector, and talk about the additional services which should be provided. I refer to services such as health physiotherapy, occupational therapy, chiropody and a range of other services that should be provided for aged people so that in fact they wilt keep an interest; so that they will not degenerate into vegetables, but will have a sort of dynamic interest in what is going on around them in their society. I suppose that one of the most depressing experiences one can have is to go into some of these nursing homes and see how aged people are virtually being turned into vegetables because they have been stuffed into a bed in a sort of geriatric factoryas Bottom and Quayle, the gentlemen to whom I referred earlier, called them-an d neglected. In the bed these people represent an income unit and this is what some of the people running these homes are interested in. If we apply these sorts of standards to these people and increasingly demand that they meet a high standard in the provision of these services, at a time when we are improving the provision of services or expanding' the provision of services given by the public and non-profit making sector, I am confident that we will practically eliminate these people who have latched on to this system not out of any sense of dedication or commitment to their own fellow man but purely because it has been a good money .making operation. I should like to have seen before us posisome sort of information which was an analysis of the cost of operation and the profitability of private nursing homes of various sizes in different parts of the Commonwealth because I want to hark back to some of the figures which I quoted quickly before. It is quite clear that many of the private nursing homes are altogether too small to operate successfully and to provide the sort of economies which will allow them to meet costs unless they are in fact heavily subsidised. I quoted the case of the Presbyterian minister, who has had considerable experience in this field, who says that nonprofit making nursing homes have to provide at least 40 beds, yet the average size is only 29 beds. We have glibly gone into this field and provided this extra amount of about $24m in a full year. But it is not our money; it is the taxpayers money. The services to be provided with that money are for a special section in the community who have rights as well as needs. We ought to be ensuring two things. The first is that those rights and needs are being maintained at a high level and protected at that level and, secondly, that when we spend the taxpayers money we do so in the most efficient way. I frankly cannot believe that the provision of private nursing homes based on a profit making concept is the most efficient way in which to use public money. I reiterate as a purely personal view, that the provision of these services should not be in the profit making sector of the community. Health and welfare should be a public responsibility. If people want to go to private nursing homes they ought to be allowed that right, but we ought to make sure that they are not squeezed into that sector, as is obviously the situation now when one makes an analysis of the provision of these nursing homes, as indicated by the statistics provided in the annual report of the Department of Health. Debate (on motion by Mr Giles) adjourned. APPLE AND PEAR STABILIZATION BILL 1971 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 August (vide page 361), on motion by Mr Sinclair: Thai the Bill be now read a second time. Mr SINCLAIR (New England-Ministe r for Primary Industry)- Mr Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure in regard to this legislation. Mr SPEAKER-Order! I have appealed, 1 think, twice tonight for a little quiet in the chamber. I will not give another warning; I shall name those honourable members who are continuously offending. Mr SINCLAIR-Befor e the debate is resumed on this Bill I suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Apple and Pear Stabilization Export Duty Bill, the Apple and Pear Stabilization Export Duty Collection Bill and the Apple and Pear Organization Bill as they are related measures. Separate questions may of course be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, Mr Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the 4 Bills to be discusser! in this debate. Mr SPEAKER-I f it is the wish of tha House for that course to be followed I will permit it to be followed. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson) (8.27)-Th e principal objective of this legislation is to implement a stabilisation scheme which in effect will support the returns or incomes of apples and pear growers for a period of 5 years commencing with the 1971 crop. The Opposition will not oppose the Bill because it at least improves the position of the apple and pear growers who are directly dependent on the industry, as well as that of the general business community and the work force indirectly dependent on the prosperity of the industry. As honourable members well know, this is a most vital industry to certain regions of Australia and in particular to the State of Tasmania. However, the Opposition will move certain amendments. The amendment to the second reading, which I move now, is as follows: That all words after That' be omitted with pared with that in Tasmania with 19 That all words after That' be omitted a view to inserting the following words in place separate licensed exporters all going their a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'while not opposing the Bill, this House is of own separate ways. But still it would be far 'while not opposing the Bill, this House is the opinion that e single national marketing better-th e Opposition cannot hammer this the opinion that e single national marketing authority should be established which will be the sole authority responsible for the export marketing of Australian apples and pears and which' will administer, in conjunction with the Commonwealth, a well formulated apple and pear stabilisation scheme'. In the Committee stage the Opposition will also move 2 amendments dealing with the price support scheme and the actual rate of stabilisation or the relationship of the maximum of 80c per bushel and the level of 4.4 million bushels to that proportion of total sales of apples and pears sold at risk. I have been associated in one way or another with stabilisation schemes for a long time, but this is the first stabilisation scheme that I have seen which is loose or perhaps risky in its application. The basic principles of administration and acquisition by a strong statutory marketing authority just do not exist in the scheme. The Government in its weakness-i t seems to be getting weaker every day as regards primary industry-instea d of implementing a strong stabilisation scheme based on the solid foundation of a single statutory marketing authority, has obviously compromised with those people who are opposed to stabilisation. They are principally, those who have vested interests in export licences as well as those who apparently do not want to lose any power or influence in the marketing system. Instead of having a strong single marketing authority the Government has implemented a scheme in which we will see the uncoordinated buying and selling of apples and pears, dominated by as many as 19 licensed operators in Tasmania operating either independently of one another or in collusion. Although in recent days there has been a decision to form a consortium, because of the decision of the Board that only one licence be granted for export from Tasmania there is still a grave element of doubt as to the effectiveness of the operation of such a scheme, when one compares i t ' with, for example, a single statutory marketing authority such as the Australian Wheat Board and others in the same category. Nevertheless this consortium, speaking with one voice as the agent of the Board, will certainly improve the position comwith pared with that in Tasmania with 19 separate licensed exporters all going their of own separate ways. But still it would be far better-th e Opposition cannot hammer this point more-i f the Government had acted strongly and had adopted the principles recommended by the recent Grant inquiry for setting up a strong single statutory authority to take full responsibility for the acquisition and disposal of apples and pears. In detail what I mean by this is as follows: Firstly, what is required is a single market- the Board and this consortium. In other Firstly, what is required is a single marketing authority to acquire apples and pears and to arrange for the selling of the entire crop either by the authority itself or by licensed exporters who have acquired expertise in the selling of the crop on interspeak with one strong voice and not in the expertise in the selling of the crop on interspeak national markets. They would act as an agent in the same way as the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd acts as an agent for the Queensland Sugar Board in disposing of the Australian sugar crop for export under certain conditions. Secondly, the fruit acquired by a statutory marketing authority would be security for advances to growers. They would have access to Reserve Bank finance as opposed to the present method, which is a most haphazard system, whereby the exporters themselves take on the system of financing, frequently having a mortgage or a lien on the crop or even on the property and tying the owner to that particular exporting firm. The third criterion with respect to a industry and it should be part and parcel The third criterion with respect to single statutory marketing authority would of the legislation. There are precedents for single statutory marketing authority would be that all fruit would be vested by title a strong single marketing authority. We be that all fruit would be vested by title in the marketing authority. It would seem have the Australian Wheat Board which in the marketing authority. It would to me that under this present Act the speaks with a strong and single voice in to me that under this present Act the Apple and Pear Board has no authority negotiating contracts, freight rates or whatApple and Pear Board has no authority negotiating whatsoever to sell the crop or to have ever action is needed. The sugar industry whatsoever to sell the crop or to have access or title to the crop. In this respect which today, with the beef industry, peraccess or title to the crop. In this respect as regards a single marketing authority haps is the most stable of all primary as regards a single marketing authority there would have to be some decision taken industries in the export field, speaks with there would have to be some decision taken with regaid to the debts which have already one strong voice in negotiating. The with regaid to the debts which have already been mounting up and which have already Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which been mounting up and which have already tied by mortgage and other agreements the is the agent for the industry, is a highly tied by mortgage and other agreements the licensed exporters and invididual growers. organised and highly efficient body in terms licensed exporters and invididual growers. Frequently the charge is made, as my of the selling of sugar. There are manyFrequently the charge is made, as my colleagues from Tasmania have often and I am one of them-wh o would like to colleagues from Tasmania have often stated, that a grower who has his crop see the cane producers having a greater say stated, that a grower who has his crop tied by lien or mortgage does not get as in the formulation of marketing policy. tied by lien or mortgage does not get high a price as he might get and should get But this does not detract from the expertise high a price as he might get and should get if that were not the case. Of course, this is of the selling agents. if that were not the case. Of course, not the only industry to which that situation applies. We hear this said frequently with respect to the wool industry. A single marketing authority would be This is an industry in which the lesson A single marketing authority would in a position to develop marketing thaf must be learned is how not to market in a position to develop marketing thaf schedules for export so that Australian a product. If there is one factor that stands schedules for export so that Australian apple and pear growers would receive the out in the way the wool industry has been apple and pear growers would receive the best possible prices in other countries through the intelligent regulation of the orderly flow of fruit to these markets. A single statutory marketing authority would also be able to exploit or develop new markets more effectively than under the present set-up with the relationship between the Board and this consortium. In other words, it would be speaking with one strong voice. Whether it were negotiating freight rates, special agreements or special prices in other parts of the world it would with one strong voice and not in the fragmented, half-baked approach this Act has in mind. The authority would have full responsibility for administering the stabilisation scheme in close consultation and collaboration with the Commonwealth. Above all, one of its main objectives, as we see it, would be the role it would play in the future in regard to planning of controlled production and realistic market demand. In this legislation there is no evidence of any desire on the part of the Government to face the serious problems of the future with regard to reconstruction and rehabilitation. At this point of time this should be a critical objective in the fruit a industry and it should be part and parcel of the legislation. There are precedents for a strong single marketing authority. We seem have the Australian Wheat Board which speaks with a strong and single voice in contracts, freight rates or whatever action is needed. The sugar industry which today, with the beef industry, perhaps is the most stable of all primary industries in the export field, speaks with one strong voice in negotiating. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which is the agent for the industry, is a highly organised and highly efficient body in terms of the selling of sugar. There are manyand I am one of them-wh o would like to see the cane producers having a greater say as in the formulation of marketing policy. But this does not detract from the expertise this is of the selling agents. In the tobacco industry we find a stable scheme. Let us compare these stable industries with, for example, the wool industry. be This is an industry in which the lesson must be learned is how not to market a product. If there is one factor that stands out in the way the wool industry has been crucified in recent years it is an inefficient made it very clear that in the fixation of crucified in recent years it is an inefficient marketing system. What puzzles me as the days go by is why this Government cannot act, and act fast, to implement a statutory authority for the acquisition of the wool clip. Here is the principle that the apple and pear stabilisation scheme must learn from. We have efficient stabilisation schemes for wheat, sugar, tobacco and other commodities but not for wool. I believe and the Opposition believes that a statutory marketing authority for the apple and pear industry would be far more efficient and effective, particularly in Tasmania, than the present legislation which was brought in by this Government. Mr Sinclair-D o you mean for home marketing or for export marketing? Dr PATTERSON- 1 mean for export marketing. Let me explain one more principle first in discussing this apple and pear stabilisation scheme. First, although it is called a stabilisation scheme let us be quite practicable. This is not a stabilisation scheme in the sense of accepted stabilisation principles. It is in effect an income support scheme. I have no argument against having such a scheme. There is every justification for it. Devaluation compensation, for example, has been terminated. I will say a little more about this later. The apple and Tasmania in particular, is deteriorating. We a little more about this later. The apple pear industry in Tasmania could not function unless it had some degree of income - support, whether it be by devaluation compensation or by an income support scheme such as this. The Minister no doubt will answer this, but in the determination of the support prices the puzzling aspect is: Who under this Act determines the level of support prices? They are prescribed, but one oan only assume that it must be determined by the Minister or the Government and not by a statutory authority such as the Apple and Pear Board which determines the level of support prices each season . for each variety of fruit. Mr Sinclair-I t is the Apple and Pear Board. Dr PATTERSON- 1 find it hard to see where this is provided for in the Act, but wc can discuss this later. The glaring anomaly in this scheme is in the adjustment of support prices. In his second reading speech the Minister for Primary Industry made it very clear that in the fixation of the support prices each season those support prices would have full regard to movements in certain costs, but nowhere in this legislation is this prescribed. This same formula was used in the wheat stabilisation scheme. Chapter and verse were stated for the costs involved, and it was also stated that movements in costs would be taken into account. But under this apple and pear legislation every grower in Australia will be fully entitled to say that the support price will not increase because it does not say so in the Act. All that the Act provides is that new prices will be announced. Mr Sinclair-I t is not the Apple and Pear Board that determines the support prices. I made a mistake. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics advises me. Dr PATTERSON-Bu t you make the decision? Mr Sinclair-Yes . Dr PATTERSON-Th e Minister makes the decision. That is what I thought. Why is an income support scheme needed? Why is this stabilisation scheme needed? First of all, we have marked variations in the price of fruit. We find that costs are increasing whereas the net income of producers, in and Tasmania in particular, is deteriorating. We see the susceptibility of price fluctuations to international marketing. We see the influence of elasticities of supply with respect to demand, which is quite clear, for example, in relation to pears. The price of pears varies inversely with the quantity exported. The devaluation of sterling by 14.3 per cent late in 1967 definitely reduced the price of apples and pears and of course definitely reduced the income earned. The second reason why the apple and pear industry must have an income support scheme is its growing dependence on export markets, particularly those where apples and pears are sold at risk. We can get an idea of this dependence on the export markets from the following figures: Tasmania accounts for 71 per cent of Australian apple exports and Western Australia accounts for 19 per cent. Sixty-nine per cent of Tasmania's production of apples is exported, and 89 per cent of Tasmania's production of non-canning pears is exported. These figures show the great vulnerability of Tasmania to the export market and they show why it is essential apples in Tasmania comes from export market and they show why it is essential that there be some type of stabilisation or sale's. That is the average received by that there be some type of stabilisation income support scheme to stabilise the growers. income support scheme to stabilise the growers. incomes 'of growers. We know how important the gross income of the apple and pear industry is to the economy of Tasmania. This scheme, of course, will be related Approximately 68 per cent of growers earn' This scheme, of course, will be related directly to sales at risk. It is in this respect less than $3,000 per annum. At the other directly to sales at risk. It is in this respect that we are now seeing fundamental end of the scale we see that 7 per cent of that we are now seeing fundamental end changes in the whole structure of the apple growers earn in excess of $10,000 per changes in the whole structure of the and pear industry. Over a long period of annum. So we can appreciate the very and pear industry. Over a long period years sales at risk were approximately 35 serious position of the majority of apple years sales at risk were approximately to 40 per cent of apples exported. Now and pear growers in Tasmania. The average to 40 per cent of apples exported. Now the percentage has jumped to almost 70 capitalisation on farms is approximately the percentage has jumped to almost 70 per cent. Tn some instances it is higher. $50,000 in Tasmania, but this capitalisation per cent. Tn some instances it is higher. With pears the Australian average is less is going down, and going down fast, With pears the Australian average is volatile. The Australian average is around because of the fall in land values and the volatile. The Australian average is around 40 to 45 per cent whereas sales at risk in fall in the profitability in apple growing. 40 to 45 per cent whereas sales at risk Tasmania are 85 per cent. Why are sales at risk increasing? First negative figure for many growers and an Why are sales at risk increasing? First of all, there is increasing technology overaverage of approximately 2 i per cent for of all, there is increasing technology seas, particularly in storage, and in relation the whole of Tasmania. seas, particularly in storage, and to varieties and the ability to spread the sales period over a greater number of months to compete more effectively with way the stabilisation rate is formulated. The months to compete more effectively with Australia. All that this really means is a two basic variables are really the upper limit, Australia. All that this really means is a decline in forward selling, with an increase of 80c a bushel and what that figure applies decline in forward selling, with an increase in risk sales. ln regard to the financial position of variables, one might say, in the formulation ln regard to the financial position of producers, as I said before, without the of Ihe scheme. In Committee we will move producers, as I said before, without the equivalent of devaluation compensation it is quite clear that very few growers, in that there be a review of the rate of is quite clear that very few growers, Tasmania in particular, will be able to stabilisation each season, not just a review Tasmania in particular, will be able to survive. It follows that, without this of the support price. Circumstances could survive. It follows that, without this scheme, very few growers in Tasmania easily arise whereby the at risk figure, for scheme, very few growers in Tasmania easily will be able to survive. If we have a look example, might jump very high and there, will be able to survive. If we have a look at the income position of some of the may be justification for increasing this at the income position of some of the growers in Tasmania we find that over the figure of 4.4 million bushels. There may growers in Tasmania we find that over the last three or four years the net farm inalso be justification for altering the limit last three or four years the net farm inalso come of apple and pear growers in the of 80c because it is quite obvious to those come of apple and pear growers in the southern part of Tasmania has averaged who understand stabilisation that if the cost southern part of Tasmania has averaged about $3,500, and in the north it has of production goes up rapidly, net income about $3,500, and in the north it has averaged much less-approximatel y $1,800. goes down. If freight rates, for example, averaged much less-approximatel y $1,800. lf we deduct devaluation compensation rise rapidly, the net return per bushel is lf we deduct devaluation compensation from these incomes we find a very reduced. Suppose the support price was $3 from these incomes we find a very reduced. stricken performance. In fact the average a bushel and the final net price received stricken performance. In fact the average net income in the south of Tasmania was $2 a bushel. At 4.4 million bushels net income in the south of Tasmania would be only about $700 per annum, of export risk, for the purposes of illustrawould be only about $700 per annum, of and in the north it would be a deficit. So tion, the producer would receive the $2 and in the north it would be a deficit. it is quite obvious that apple growers in plus 80c-no t $1 but 80c. At 6.6 million it is quite obvious that apple growers this part of Australia could not continue bushels he would receive the $2 plus 53c this part of Australia could not continue to function unless they had some type of - no t $1 and not 80c. At 8.8 million to function unless they had some type income support programme. Over 90 per bushels he would receive the $2 plus 40c income support programme. Over 90 per cent of the total gross farm returns from - no t 80c and not $1. cent of the total gross farm apples in Tasmania comes from export or sale's. That is the average received by Let us have a lookat the distribution of net farm income for Tasmanian apple and pear growers. Forty-four per cent of growers earn less than $2,000 per annum. Approximately 68 per cent of growers earn' less than $3,000 per annum. At the other of the scale we see that 7 per cent of apple growers earn in excess of $10,000 per of annum. So we can appreciate the very 35 serious position of the majority of apple and pear growers in Tasmania. The average capitalisation on farms is approximately $50,000 in Tasmania, but this capitalisation less is going down, and going down fast, because of the fall in land values and the in fall in the profitability in apple growing. In fact, when one takes the ra:e of return on capital one gets, in many cases, a negative figure for many growers and an overaverage of approximately 2 i per cent for in relation the whole of Tasmania. The Opposition also takes issue with the way the stabilisation rate is formulated. The two basic variables are really the upper limit, of 80c a bushel and what that figure applies to, which is the 4.4 million bushels-th e at risk proportion. They are the two basic variables, one might say, in the formulation of Ihe scheme. In Committee we will move in that there be a review of the rate of stabilisation each season, not just a review of the support price. Circumstances could arise whereby the at risk figure, for example, might jump very high and there, may be justification for increasing this figure of 4.4 million bushels. There may be justification for altering the limit of 80c because it is quite obvious to those who understand stabilisation that if the cost of production goes up rapidly, net income goes down. If freight rates, for example, rise rapidly, the net return per bushel is Suppose the support price was $3 a bushel and the final net price received was $2 a bushel. At 4.4 million bushels export risk, for the purposes of illustraSo tion, the producer would receive the $2 in plus 80c-no t $1 but 80c. At 6.6 million bushels he would receive the $2 plus 53c of - no t $1 and not 80c. At 8.8 million bushels he would receive the $2 plus 40c returns from - no t 80c and not $1. So it is quite obvious that the level of freight rates, the level of wages and the level of other costs will be a very important determinant not only in regard to future support prices, the final price received by the individual grower and the average return for the season but also in the actual level of the deficiency payment, as one might call it, being received by the grower himself. We can forget about the other complication of the grower having to pay into the stabilisation scheme. I am not normally a pessimist but I just cannot see the position arising where the price of apples and pears will climb so high that in fact the grower will be contributing to the stabilisation fund - tha t is, a true stabilisation fund; that is the point I make. In actual fact this is an income support scheme with which I have no argument whatsoever because it is justified. In terms of the upper limit of 4.4 million bushels one can see that in the next 5 years there will be an increase in apple and pear production because if I expand the theory I have been stating about the relationship of the 80c to the price of apples it is quite obvious that the bigger the grower the more he will benefit by this scheme, simply because his additional cost for each bushel grown is lower than the marginal cost of the smaller grower. It will pay him, one might say, to increase production provided his marginal return is greater than his marginal cost. This can not apply with equal force to the smaller grower and consequently we can see an encouragement in some circumstances for an increase in the production of apples particularly. Projections are that the total production in Australia could rise to 22 million bushels. Consumption is running at 13 million or 14 million bushels. Exports will probably be 9 million or 10 million bushels. Bearing these figures in mind, if there is an increase in sales at risk there will be justification for having a good look at this upper limit Of 4.4 million bushels. As regards future marketing prospects, today the United Kingdom is our principal export market. There are important markets in West Germany, Sweden and South East Asia, but I think one can and should assume for purposes of reconstruction and rehabilitation that the United Kingdom market is most shaky and by all accounts will probably disappear. South Africa is expanding its marketing promotion. Europe is expanding its export marketing and France and Italy, for example, are certain to increase their production of apples and pears progressively to make up the leeway which will probably occur by our loss of markets if Britain joins the European Common Market. I think the most pertinent part of this legislation and the one with which we will deal more in the Committee stage is that relating to the fixation of the level of price support at the beginning of the season for each variety of fruit. The level has been fixed for this year but already there has been a signincant increase in costs. It would seem that no provision is made in this legislation to take into account the escalation in costs which has occurred since the level of price support for individual varieties was fixed. In the view of the Opposition this is a serious deficiency in the legislation. But even more important than that is the method by which the Minister, acting on the advice of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics with respect to specific costs, will fix the level of support prices each season. I cannot understand why the Government has obviously deliberately omitted from this Bill its intentions regarding the effect on costs of movements in price indices. The model to be looked at here is the wheat stabilisation scheme. When this new formula was introduced the Government, with the full support of the Opposition, completely threw overboard the old outmoded cost of production concept in which interest on land was having a crucifying effect on the cost of production and making a farce out of the costing procedure. At least the Government wrote into the wheat stabilisation legislation its intention regarding the fixing of the price each year. No such intention is written into this Bill and that is why in the Committee stage we will fully debate clause 7 because in the next 5 years the level of price support for each variety and the rate of stabilisation will be the key to the whole scheme. There are many other aspects with which I would like to have dealt but unfortunately I do not have time. Mr SPEAKER-Order ! The honourable member's time has expired. Is the amendment seconded? Mr Duthie- I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak. Mf LLOYD (Murray) (8.59)- I wish to compliment the Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr Sinclair) and his predecessor, the present Minister for Trade and Industry ( Mr Anthony), for their long and patient endeavour until sufficient agreement was reached between the various sections of the apple and pear industry to enable this legislation to be presented. Obtaining agreement is a difficult task with any primary industry that is spread over several States. Probably no section of the industry is entirely happy' with the scheme, but that is to be expected. Two distinct types of fruit, apples and pears, are being dealt with together. The areas of production are scattered around Australia. Uncertainty exists because the percentage of exports at risk varies from year to year. This has an influence on support levels. This is a pioneer scheme, the first of its type for this industry. The Minister summed the situation up, I believe, when in his second reading speech on the Apple and Pear Stabilization Bill 1971 he said: tt is intended that the scheme will give. a authority that is proposed is what the tt is intended that the scheme will give. considerable measure of stability to the industry industry will have. But I believe that. it considerable measure of stability to the industry to assist it to examine' its otber problems and to should be established by stages and not to assist it to examine' its otber problems take steps to meet them. At this point, I disagree with the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson). I Labor Party by the honourable member for able member for Dawson (Dr Patterson). believe that at this stage-an d I emphasise Dawson also seeks: believe that at this stage-an the words 'at this stage'-th e proposal that would be introduced if the amendment was stabilisation scheme. would be introduced if the amendment carried would add confusion to complicaThis is the vague old general principle that carried would add confusion to complicaThis tion. There is enough complication in 'everything will be right the way we do it tion. There is enough complication in .legislation on this subject at the present but everything you do is wrong'. But the .legislation on this subject at the present time. The fact that we are dealing with manner in which the result will be achieved time. The fact that we are dealing with 4 separate Bills and a whole schedule of is never spelt out in detail. 4 separate Bills and a whole schedule varieties of fruits points to this. I believe that the best method is to take greater marketing authority. I believe that the best method a step at a time to sort out these complications and the inevitable problems which will arise in a pioneer scheme of statement. It is nice, and vague although it which will arise in a pioneer scheme of this type. If this amendment was carried dbes sound attractive. It is when the details this type. If this amendment was carried and a statutory marketing authority was must be spelt out-i n this case 4 separate and a statutory marketing authority was introduced too abruptly, it could create a Bills have been required-tha t reality must introduced too abruptly, it could create bigger problem and a mess in the industry be faced. A bit of reality from the point bigger problem and a mess in the industry which would have it worse than it is at of view of the Labor Party would not hurt which would have it worse than it is at the present time. I believe that the the whole industry. the present time. I believe that the the whole industry. approach being adopted by the Minister is the correct approach. His proposal is to take one step at a time, feeling the way until each problem is sorted out. I believe that the Minister made this point very clearly when he refused a request from apple and pear growers for special financial assistance to offset the cost of freight increases. Speaking on this point, the Minister urged the industry more or less to put its house in order first before asking for further government assistance. This will mean a single selling organisation for exports, and possibly for each State. Tasmania is moving in this direction already. It will lead to a reduction in the number of brands, economies in bulk packaging, loading and so on. I believe that this in turn will strengthen the hand of apple and pear growers in their freight rate negotiations, just as the New Zealand growers have been strengthened. The Hobart 'Mercury' of Saturday last stated that Tasmania will issue one licence only for exports in the 1972 season. I believe that Victoria is to hold a meeting on this subject on Wednesday week. I believe in moderation so that over-complication and confusion do not arise. The industry is moving in the right direction. Ultimately the type of statutory marketing export a authority that is proposed is what the industry will have. But I believe that. it and to should be established by stages and not come overnight. The amendment moved on behalf of the I Labor Party by the honourable member for d I emphasise Dawson also seeks: . . . a well formulated apple and pear was stabilisation scheme. is the vague old general principle that 'everything will be right the way we do it but everything you do is wrong'.

As the total quantity of of Tasmania. I am told that Australia's pear production approximates 9 million pears represents one-quarter only of the pear production approximates 9 million bushels annually. Of this total, approxitotal quantity of apples, pears cannot exert bushels annually. Of this total, approxitotal mately half is in the form of canned pears over the scheme the influence that apples mately half is in the form of canned pears and half of the remaining 50 per cent-tha t can. and half of the remaining 50 per cent-tha t can. is, 25 per cent of the total pear crop in Australia-i s exported as fresh fruit. The Goulburn Valley produces about 80 per speech on the Apple and Pear Stabilization Goulburn Valley produces about 80 per cent of Victoria's pears and about 60 per Bill 1971, the Minister referred to this cent of Victoria's pears and about 60 per cent of Australia's pear exports originate fact. He stated: cent of Australia's pear exports originate fact. He stated: there. So, the Shepparton-Kyabram-Tatura area is the dominant fresh, and canned pear liability in respect of the fruit of a season will area is the dominant fresh, and canned pear liability export area of Australia. I wish to restrict be my remarks to the section bf the scheme braces both apples and pears and there are not my remarks to the section bf the scheme braces relating to pears and to the effect that the separate specific quantities for each variety of relating to pears and to the effect that the legislation will have on the exporters of apples and pears. Inthe light of this fact the induslegislation will have on the exporters of apples pears in the Goulburn Valley. The people to whom I refer are not entirely happy with the failure to provide in the scheme a guarantee for pear 'exports sold at risk'. As I said earlier, the ratio of apple to pear exports is approximately 4 to 1. This dominance of apples, coupled the year-to-year variations in the proportion of apples sold at risk, tends to nullify the security or stability that this scheme is supposed to bring to the pear industry as well as to the apple industry. believe the figures for 1970 show that 3.3 million bushels of apples were sold as exreports at risk while 1.36 million bushels of pears were sold as exports at risk. The total Australia exports of apples and pears sold at risk for export was 4.66 million bushels. The unofficial estimates that I have been given for the 1971 season which has ended show that the total production sold for export at risk has risen from 4.66 million bushels to approximately 7.47 bushels. The figure with respect to apples has almost doubled. It has risen from 3.3 million bushels to 6.225 million bushels. The figure for pears has remained in reasonably stable at 1.25 million bushels. The point I make here is that the Bill allows that a total of only 4.4 million bushels of apples and pears at risk can 1 receive the maximum support of 80c net If the number of bushels of apples at risk continues to rise, as it may have risen this season to 6.225 million the number of bushels of apples alone will exceed the maximum amount ot 4.4 million bushels which may receive support at 80c a bushel. This could significantly reduce the support for the pear section of the scheme. As the total quantity of pears represents one-quarter only of the quantity of apples, pears cannot exert over the scheme the influence that apples I am glad that, in his second reading speech on the Apple and Pear Stabilization Bill 1971, the Minister referred to this I said previously that the Commonwealth's in respect of the fruit of a season will related to the total quantity of fruit of that season exported at risk. That total quantity emboth apples and pears and there are not separate specific quantities for each variety of and pears. Inthe light of this fact the industry has asked for an assurance by the Government that should any major anomaly, such as an imbalance in the relativity between apples and pears, be so evident as to affect seriously the scheme at any stage in its lifetime' the Government will, be prepared to discuss: the matter with the industry to sec if it is necessary lo amend the arrangeFreight will now be $2.77 a case or to sec if it is necessary lo amend the ments under the plan and the legislation. I am happy to be able to give the industry such an assurance. I remind the Minister of this point because this problem could arise fairly soon in regard to the imbalance between apples and pears sold at risk under this scheme. Another problem faced by, I think, both apple and pear growers-howeve r I will deal only with the pear growers-unde r the provisions of this scheme relates to the schedule of varieties. This schedule is at the end of the Apple and Pear Stabilization Bill 1971 and it details the varietal groups. I know that the introduction of other varieties would complicate an already complicated situation. One variety of pears alone-Packham-account s about 60 per cent of our total pear exports. However, the problem is with WBC pears, or if you like William pears. This is the main canning variety. This variety of pear is grouped with other pears in the varietal groupings. There is a surplus of the William variety in the Goulburn Valley for canning requirements. Goulburn Valley exporters have tried very hard to expand their fresh export sales of this variety to relieve the problem. However, the return claimed by the exporters of this variety for this season was below the support level of $2.55 per bushel but because other varieties in this group appear to haVe sold at above $2.55 per bushel the growers of William pears will have to pay into the scheme when in fact they should receive a pay-out from this scheme. Because the William variety was grouped with other varieties the absurd position is that the growers of this variety who actually sold the pears at below the support level will have to pay into the scheme instead of receiving payment. The spectre of everincreasing freight rates and of the United Kingdom's impending entry into the European Common Market hangs over the entire horticultural industries of Australia. These industries cover the fresh, canned fruits and dried vine fruits. The latest 22i per cent increase in freight rates to the United Kingdom, or if you like 24 per cent on another way of reckoning, means the grower will lose an extra 51c a case. arrangeFreight will now be $2.77 a case or about 40 per cent of the gross return to the grower. j Any discussion on the horticultural industries must include points relating to reconstruction. 1 believe that one matter upon which the Minister and the indusiry agree is that some form of treepull scheme is inevitable and necessary for this industry. Perhaps the other types of fruit industries may not need a scheme for a year or two. I notice that the Minister in a speech to the Apple and Pear Growers Federation a week or so ago mentioned this point. The peach and pear growers in northern Victoria urgently require the introduction of such a scheme. In the 1971 season 25,000 tons of pears could for not be harvested in the Goulburn Valley because they were excess to canning requirements. The way this season is shaping there will again probably be at least 25,000 tons of pears dropping on the ground. Even though all the horticultural industries will require in the long term, because of marketing problems, a treepull compensation scheme, I ask the Minister to give the Goulburn Valley growers of soft fruits an opportunity to introduce such a scheme or that part of suoh a scheme relating directly to them ahead of the rest of the schemes that will be required so that they might avoid any greater problems of poverty and over-production in this area. When the Minister for Primary Industry refused the request of the apple and pear growers for emergency financial assistance to meet increased freight rates he suggested that they should put their house in order first. I emphasise the word 'first'. It appears that this industry is moving with some speed to do just this. I hope that when the industry does put its house in order, if freight rates and the costs of production increase the Minister will then honour the other part of his statement to provide whatever assistance may be required. It may be a greater financial commitment from the Federal Government that what is at present envisaged. It may mean the establishment of a statutory authority after the present teething problems and other complications are worked out. It could mean other things. But I do hope that the Minister will remember this point and that when the indusiry puts its house in order and requires more assistance the request will be considered favourably. As I said at the commencement of my speech, probably noone is entirely happy with the provisions of this legislation because of the complications involved in it. 1 bave mentioned several points about which the pear growers in the Goulburn Valley are not very happy. However, this legislation is a major breakthrough for the industry. It is a starting point upon which the industry can build. 1 support the legislation. Mr DUTHIE (Wilmot) (9.17)-Th e honourable member for Murray ( Mr Lloyd) has a lot to answer for. He commenced his speech by eulogising the Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr Sinclair) but halfway through his speech be began to criticise aspects of this legislation in no uncertain terms, especially the guaranteed 4.4 million bushels for export. In the Committee stage the Opposition will move an amendment seeking an increase from 4.4 million to 7.5 million bushels. We on this side will naturally expect the honourable member for Murray to vote with us on such an important amendment. This is the only way in which he can give effect tb his statements. In other respects the honourable member is in agreement with honourable members on this side in expressing many doubts about this scheme. This is a beginning. It is an historical piece of legislation. This industry is one of illustrated. piece of legislation. This industry is one of illustrated. the last major export industries to come under a stabilisation plan. The tragedy is that this was not done 5 years ago. The is so vulnerable to changes in freight that this was not done 5 years ago. The Government allowed this industry to get charges as the apple and pear export Government allowed this industry to into a state of absolute crisis before it industry, because 60 per cent of its costs into a state of absolute crisis before it was prepared to introduce such a scheme. are freight costs. If a grower is to be was prepared to introduce such a scheme. I am the Secretary of the Tasmanian forced to pay an extra 50c a case, as is I am the Secretary of the Tasmanian Labor Party Rural Committee which is a being sought by the Salen shipping comLabor Party Rural Committee which is 75 per cent farmer committee. That combine at the present time, this will lift his 75 per cent farmer committee. That combine mittee put forward a scheme to an Ausfreight per case to $3.10. With other basic mittee put forward a scheme to an Ausfreight tralian Labor Party conference 2 years costs such as handling costs, insurance, tralian Labor Party conference 2 years ago and it was accepted. The basis of the commission, pruning, spraying, inspection, ago and it was accepted. The basis of the ALP stabilisation scheme for this industry fertilisation, cartage, etc., added to the ALP stabilisation scheme for this industry has already been written into the ALP's $3.10 the grower will be out of business has already been written into the ALP's rural policy. Why has this Government given the average price of $5.50 a case that rural policy. Why has this Government given waited until this industry was on its last was obtained in England last year. So the waited until this industry was on its last legs before introducing the proposed grower would have to get nearly $6 a case legs before introducing the proposed scheme outlined in this legislation? We at least in England for his fruit even to scheme outlined in this legislation? We welcome this scheme. However it is not balance his budget, without making any welcome this scheme. However it is not a full-blooded stabilisation plan like other profit at all. When one considers the a full-blooded stabilisation plan like stabilisation plans introduced for Australian tremendous importance of freight rates and stabilisation plans introduced for Australian industries. There are serious gaps in this plan, as the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) expertly indicated tonight in his speech. Firstly, the guarantee for each variety of fruit is too low. Secondly, this scheme covers only 4.4 million bushels of export fruit when Tasmania alone exports at risk nearly 7 million bushels. The Opposition will seek to have this export figure of 4.4 million bushels raised to 7.5 million bushels. I point out that this has been a request by the Apple and Pear Growers' Federation of Tasmania, which represents 75 per cent of the growers in that State. Thirdly, this Bill fails to allow for all changes in the cost of production, and this is a major weakness. Only a portion of total production will attract the annual stabilised price for each variety of fruit and the Bill does not lake into consideration the most important factor, freight variations. Fourthly, it does not make the Federal Government responsible in any way for freight increases. In other words, there are no clauses in the Bill which says that the Commonwealth will underwrite freight increases, and unless this is provided the stabilisation scheme is utterly meaningless because Ihe guarantee will be partly wiped out by increased freight charges at any old time. When it is known that 60 per cent of the growers' cost per bushel is freight then the paramount and critioal effect of freight on the industry is vividly No other Australian export industry is so vulnerable to changes in freight get charges as the apple and pear export industry, because 60 per cent of its costs are freight costs. If a grower is to be forced to pay an extra 50c a case, as is a being sought by the Salen shipping comat the present time, this will lift his per case to $3.10. With other basic costs such as handling costs, insurance, commission, pruning, spraying, inspection, fertilisation, cartage, etc., added to the $3.10 the grower will be out of business the average price of $5.50 a case that was obtained in England last year. So the grower would have to get nearly $6 a case at least in England for his fruit even to balance his budget, without making any other profit at all. When one considers the tremendous importance of freight rates and the influence they have on the apple and pear industry it is amazing there is no provision in the Bill to cover freight charges. The last increase that was sought was of 25.45 per cent. So far the Apple and Pear Board has refused to accept it and the shipping lines have refused to compromise. At this moment, therefore, there is no movement either way. The question is in abeyance and has to be decided very shortly. It would lift the freight charge by 50c a case if the Board accepted the demands of this nonconference shipping combine, if I can call it that. 1 found in the Budget papers a remarkable piece of information. During the last 5 years this Government has subsidised the Australian-South American shipping service to the tune of $1.101m and it would not come to the party when Tasmanians asked it to subsidise the shipping freights between Tasmania and the mainland to help counter the recent big rise imposed by the Australian National Line. That is just in passing. There is an urgent need for a vital reorganisation of the industry and an entirely new approach. Old methods cannot meet today's challenge from competition, from overseas demand for quality fruit, from the urgent need to cut handling costs, from shipping problems, marketing, packaging and presentation. New ideas are necessary in order to cope with these demands and these challenges. Changes vitally required include firstly the stabilisation plan we have this is required. . . . include firstly the stabilisation before us now., although when Labor comes to office the scheme will be boosted and expanded to a full-blooded stabilisation scheme, not the piecemeal one that it is at the moment. However, this plan is vital as one of the new elements in the industry. Secondly, we desperately need one marketing authority, operating not only in Tasmania but in each of the other States, marketing fruit overseas. There is one in New Zealand and one in South Africa and both are working successfully for the industry. In Tasmania alone there are 19 exporters of fruit. Could a more confusing situation than that exist? All are competing against each other. The Grant Board of Inquiry recommended in 1970, a year ago this month, that one marketing authority be set up. Its chairman was Professor J. Grant, of the Tasmanian University, and the members were Mr A. P. Calvert, Mr L. Cox, Mr C. B. Hewitt, Mr W. A. Smith and Mr R. F. Walsh. Its main recommendations are on page 11 of its excellent report, which we have studied. I will read some of them because they should be written into Hansard. They are: 1. That the Authority have the sole responsibility for the export marketing of apples and pears on behalf of Tasmanian growers. . . . 2. That the expertise of those at present engaged in the apple and pear export trade be retained by the Authority appointing consenting companies from among the present Licensed Exporters as selling agents on a commission or other agreed basis. . . . 3. That the title to all apples and pears accepted for overseas export from Tasmania be vested in the Authority and that such fruit shall become the absolute property of the Authority free of all encumbrances. . . . 4. That where fruit is accepted by the Authority for export overseas was previously subject to a bill of sale, mortgage, lien or other incumbrance, the producer be required to give notice of such prior encumbrance to the Authority and the Authority may negotiate with the parties for the repayment of the debt from the proceeds of fruit sold, after the Authority has recovered its seasonal advance to the grower. . . . 5. That the Authority make limited advances to growers to cover the cost of spray materials, fertilisers and packaging materials upon terms determined by the Authority. . . . 6. That the fruit acquired by the Authority be part of the security offered for advances from the Rural Credit Department of the Reserve Bank of Australia and that this security be supported by a guarantee hy the Tasmanian Government if plan we have this is required. . . . 7. That for each variety, count, market or other significant characteristic which the Authority regards important, it may operate a separate pool to which the proceeds will be credited and from which payments will be made to growers on the basis of the quantity of the fruit supplied. . . . 8. That the Authority have the power to organise the assembly and the shipment of fruit and to negotiate contracts for the provision of shipping to carry fruit to overseas markets. . . . 9. That the Authority be empowered to participate in any scheme for devaluation compensation, industry restructuring, stabilisation or income support arranged by the Commonwealth Government. . . . I will not read the rest of the recommendations because I have not the time but there are 4 other clauses which show how comprehensive this Authority would be if it were set up. At present the Tasmanian Government will not set it up. It is talking about 1973 but by that time there will be no industry to organise. The Opposition condemns the Tasmanian Government tonight for its failure to implement a scheme that was suggested in recommendations made 12 months ago by this Board of Inquiry which that Government appointed. We must have recognised and selected agents to handle the export of our fruit and its marketing at the United Kingdom and Continent end. That is most important. On Friday last, 1st October, the Board made a. momentous decision to issue only one licence to a consortium of exporters for the coming season. This is a step in the right direction and will have the effect of bringing the 19 exporters together to act as one body. Here is the germ of the idea of one fruit exporting authority. I congratulate the Board for its courage in bringing down this revolutionary decision last Friday. There must be stabilised shipping freight rates for the industry. I do not have time to explore this subject any further except to say that the recent increases demanded by the non-conference lines are nothing short of piracy on the high seas so far as the Australian fruit industry is concerned. The unitisation of fruit must be fully implemented as the only successful method of getting fruit to the ships an.d away. Only 9 per cent of our fruit was unitised in 1970. This year, 15.5 per cent was unitised and next year it is expected that 40 per cent will be unitised but by 1973 or 1974 ail fruit must be unitised as a great cost saver. Further, there must be one brand instead of 150 brands. At present 150 Tasmanian brands are being exported. This is disastrous and confusing. It slows down loading and out-turn and causes endless delays and frustrations when ships are being unloaded. Stabilisation of containers is necessary as at present 27 different types of containers are being used in Tasmania. This set-up delays the stowage of fruit and its handling and unloading overseas. I believe that the provision of bulk containers is tbe answer for each variety. In a few years, there will be only one brand of fruit and it will be all exported in bulk. Therefore, with the changes that I have proposed-on e brand, a standardisation of containers, and one marketing authority with centralised packing sheds under authority inspection-i t will be possible to reduce thc costs of handling fruit by 31c a bushel. This saving in costs could be the blood transfusion that could save the industry. We need new markets in Asia because the old markets in Europe are on the way out, as the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) pointed out. What will we do when or if Britain joins the European Economic Community? I understand that at its conference last week-end the Labour Party in Britain decided to oppose wholesale Britain's entry into the Common Market. I anticipated this a year ago, and I still think the proposal for Britain's entry could be defeated in the House of Commons. However, we need new markets, such as in the Philippines. Unfortunately, credit arrangements between Australia and the Philippines are poor and we may have to institute a barter system whereby we can ship our fruit to the Philippines and receive goods in return. Japan produces 65 million cases of fruit annually but still imports millions of cases and we must get into that market. China has a huge potential though it grows a lot of fruit of its own. We have not explored that market yet. There is no doubt that trade will shift from Europe to Asia in the next few years when the United Kingdom joins the Common Market. Finally, in Asia we need State trade commissioners as well as Commonwealth trade commissioners. Mr Birrell-Lik e South Australia has. Mr DUTHIE-Yes , and Western Australia. It is not enough to have in these eastern countries Commonwealth trade commissioners who are supposed to be working for the States. They are not. They work for the Commonwealth as such and not for the individual States. For a start I believe we should have State trade commissioners in Tokyo and. Singapore. To my mind, this is so important that I foresee the transfer of the Tasmanian AgentGeneral from London to Tokyo or Singapore in the next 10 years, for he will be useless in London if Britain enters the Common Market. An act of statesmanship would be to transfer his office to Singapore, which is the fourth largest trading port in the world today and which is growing every week."" We should have a State trade commissioner in Singapore and in Tokyo, covering the whole-of Asia and selling State goods. We should not have only Commonwealth officers selling Commonwealth exports, if it h too cosdy for Tasmania to institute this scheme perhaps it could, co-operate whh South Australia and establish a South Australian and Tasmanian partnership in Singapore or Tokyo. A year ago Western Australia established a trade mission or Agent-General in Tokyo on which it is spending $55,000 annually. This is money well spent and it will be returned a thousand-fold over the years. Mr Sinclair-D o you not think an Australian partnership is just as good? Mr DUTHIE-No , I do not.. I honestly do not think that Commonwealth trade commission officers have the same interest in States as State officers would have. I am quite sure of this. Therefore, it is imperative that we establish trading posts and a trading voice for Tasmania in Asia. What a tragedy it is that we do not have our own overseas shipping line. Half of the present problems in the fruit industry word 'marketing' in this context but if I of the present problems in the fruit industry would not have arisen had the legislation introduced by Ben Chifley in 1949 been implemented, I was here in 1949 and spoke in favour of and voted for the proposal to create an overseas shipping line. Four months later the Labor Party was defeated at the polls and the first Menzies Government did not implement that legislation but let it lapse. If Australia had established its own conference line of overseas ships then, by now we would have 15 or 20 modern ships operating between Australia and overseas. These vessels would be owned by the Australian Government and the Australian people and this would have enabled us to have controlled freight rates over the years and given to our primary producers the protection they needed from the sea bandits, the freight bandits and the Philistines of the conference lines who have had us by the throat for so many years. If we had our own overseas shipping line we would not have had the crisis we have today with our fruit exports. . Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mr Hallett)Orderl Before calling the honourable member for Angas, I ask the honourable members for Grayndler and Dawson to refrain from audible conversation at the table. It is very difficult for Hansard to hear the member who is speaking. Mr GILES (Angas) (9.35)- I support the Government's stabilisation scheme for the apple industry with no hesitation and with some degree of enthusiasm. Quite logically, I also do not support the amendment of the Australian Labor Party for a single national marketing authority. Mr Grassby-Wh y not? Mr GILES-I t would take a long time, to answer that interjection but I will certainly do so. l f the honourable member for Riverina took the opportunity to examine the costs of running marketing schemes on an Australian basis, he would come to the conclusion that historically these costs have been one of the biggest socks ever to our primary producers. If the honourable member wanted to do a little more research, rather than go off half-cocked, he could look at the history of this very industry with which this Bill in concerned. He would see what attitude the growers took to an apple and pear marketing board. I think that I am right to use the word 'marketing' in this context but if I am wrong I shall withdraw it. At any rate, they were hopelessly out of favour with it because it cost them, as primary producers, a lot of money to administer. That is one of my reasons for opposing the amendment, and it is only a start. I could go on from point to point on this subject. For' instance, I could tie in the remarks of the honourable member for Riverina ( Mr Grassby) with those of the honourable, member for Wilmot ( Mr Duthie). As I understood him, the honourable member for Wilmot castigated the Tas-. manian Government for not acting unilaterally to establish a State marketing authority. If any honourable member wants to see the futility of such a proposal, I invite him to visit my electorate in South Australia and look at an organisation called the Citrus Organising Committee which is doing precisely what the honourable member for Wilmot is suggesting the. Tasmanian Government should do through a State authority. His proposal is futile for many reasons but principally because a single State authority cannot introduce a statutory board. A State cannot control the marketing of produce once State borders are crossed, let alone oceans. I would have thought that the honourable member for Wilmot would have been aware of that distinction and would have been fair enough to absolve the Tasmanian Government, about which I know very little but about which I repeatedly hear some good, from the effects of his futile thinking. That, patently, is exactly what he is up to in relation to this. I do not blame the Labor Party for one my electorate are worried about. I do not blame the Labor Party for minute for trying to grab frantically for some new scheme. It is very easy when worry about in Tasmania on that. They some new scheme. It is very easy when one is in trouble to try to develop some congratulate- one is in trouble to try to develop some congratulate- form of new thinking. The only problem that exists at this point of time is that there are many States that will not agree - Order ! The honourable member for Wilthere are many States that will not agree with the honourable member who has mot will cease interjecting. with the honourable member who moved the amendment. My own State would most certainly be one of them. The if the honourable member could introduce would most certainly be one of them. The States would not agree to have some blue me one day to apple growers who would States would not agree to have some blue print forced on them by a hierarchical sort not blame increasing wage costs for some print forced on them by a hierarchical sort of authority such as the honourable memof the difficulties they are in. Is the honof authority such as the honourable memof ber for Dawson probably has in mind. So ourable member going to reply to that? ber for Dawson probably has in mind. let us not talk theoretical nonsense like this. The facts of the matter are that thc producers of this country by and large do honourable member for Angas will direct producers of this country by and large not want precisely what the Opposition his remarks to the Chair. not want precisely what the Opposition today, by way of its amendment, is suggesting should be brought in. The honourable member for Wilmot did Australia you will find the same thing is The honourable member for Wilmot did not mention, for instance, the varieties of so. However, perhaps I might get a little not mention, for instance, the varieties apple that are not wanted overseas. Surely closer to home. I remind the House that apple that are not wanted overseas. Surely the Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr not long ago, I am told, 9 ships which the Minister for Primary Industry ( Sinclair), who is at the table, is correct were involved in moving apples-an d I Sinclair), who is at the table, is correct when he draws the attention of the indusimagine that most of them carried small when he draws the attention of the indusimagine try in general to some of the problems that loads-wer e held up in Port Adelaide for try in general to some of the problems that exist within the channels of that industry.

This kind of delay does not help exist within the channels of that industry. am not expert on wharf costs, handling, the cost structure of the industry.. am not expert on wharf costs, handling, palletisation or any form of loading apples, even cellular cartons but I do know these representing the industry and exporters in even cellular cartons but I do know these are used fairly substantially by my State a telegram in which I drew attenare used fairly substantially co-operatives in South Australia. However, tion to this fact and to the fact that co-operatives in South Australia. However, I do know that it is right to query whether increased costs on freight alone of 24 per I do know that it is right to query whether we should be trying to foist on to the cent-fo r instance, on the Europe-United we should be trying to foist on to the export markets of the world apples that Kingdom conference-wa s greater than export markets of the world apples that are not required. I do know that this sort any benefit that averaged out in any of the are not required. I do know that this sort of thinking is common sense. I do know 18 varietal pools. I support what was said of thinking is common sense. I do know that transport and wage costs at wharf by the honourable member for Murray that transport and wage costs at wharf which I have just mentioned are important ( Mr Lloyd) when he talked about the which I have just mentioned are important factors. For example, the honourable problems of the pear industry. factors. For example, the honourable member for Sturt ( Mr Foster) will not like it one bit when I point out my complete lack of understanding-an d I remain ment to this is the argument that was lack of understanding-an d I remain unmoved by any argument against it-o f implied by the honourable members for unmoved by any argument against it-o unions demanding increased wage rates at Dawson and Wilmot throughout this unions demanding increased wage rates wharves for loading apples. I cannot debate. I think the honourable member for wharves for loading apples. I cannot understand why the unions insist that their Wilmot said that this is not a full blooded understand why the unions insist that their members require higher and higher wages stabilisation scheme and that it is to be members require higher and higher wages for transport. I cannot for the life of me hoped that from the point of view of those for transport. I cannot for the life of see why unions such as these insist on trying to grind an apple grower who is having a hard trot completely into the ground by virtually their own insular thinking. 1 would be interested to hear later the replies to these contentions. But these are things that the apple growers in one my electorate are worried about. Mr Duthie-The y have nothing to worry about in Tasmania on that. They Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mr Hallett) - Order ! The honourable member for Wilhas mot will cease interjecting. Mr GILES- I would be very interested if the honourable member could introduce me one day to apple growers who would not blame increasing wage costs for some the difficulties they are in. Is the honSo ourable member going to reply to that? Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order ! The do honourable member for Angas will direct his remarks to the Chair. Mr GILES- I am sorry. Mr Deputy Speaker, but I am sure that in Western Australia you will find the same thing is of so. However, perhaps I might get a little closer to home. I remind the House that Mr not long ago, I am told, 9 ships which were involved in moving apples-an d I that most of them carried small loads-wer e held up in Port Adelaide for I 10 days. This kind of delay does not help the cost structure of the industry.. Three weeks ago I sent to the Minister representing the industry and exporters in by my State a telegram in which I drew attention to this fact and to the fact that increased costs on freight alone of 24 per cent-fo r instance, on the Europe-United Kingdom conference-wa s greater than any benefit that averaged out in any of the 18 varietal pools. I support what was said by the honourable member for Murray ( Mr Lloyd) when he talked about the problems of the pear industry. However, I think that the opposite argument to this is the argument that was f implied by the honourable members for at Dawson and Wilmot throughout this debate. I think the honourable member for Wilmot said that this is not a full blooded stabilisation scheme and that it is to be me hoped that from the point of view of those who continue growing apples that it will not develop into a full blooded stabilisation scheme. By that statement I hope the honourable member does not mean that there should be a bigger deficiency payment to apple growers because nothing could ruin more quickly the totality of apple growers in a situation where they cannot easily quit their product on export under a situation of increasing production of apples. As far as I am concerned, I believe that this is a clear implication from what has been said tonight by both honourable members. Mr Birrell-Yo u could apply that to other industries. Mr GILES- I can apply it to quite a few rural industries. I could apply it to .one industry called the wine industry and say that the Government is not giving out to apple growers in this case nearly as much as even the depleted amount it hopes to gain from wine-grape growers. The House will hear a lot more about this in due course when my motion comes forward in relation to this matter. I would like to get back to the scheme itself because I think it is important. I hope that I have convinced the House that I have no intention of supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dawson. I would, like to go on ancl say that the average export support prices will be set out with regard to movements in cash costs. They will be brought into effect in their entirety each year by the Government through the Minister. I think 1 have made my own point, of view plain. If we look at the balance of the industry in Australia I think we see that we have reached the unhappy stage where the attitude of my own State probably is a proper one, if a selfish one. The growers in my State say: 'For goodness sake, we must look after the position of apple exports from Tasmania'. They realise that this is of prime importance to them because Tasmania has an enormous surplus of apples in excess of normal home requirements. Western Australia, for instance, which exports through. 3 ports to Europe and the United Kingdom is the next highest exporter of apples. On 1970 export figures Western Australia exported over 1 million bushels of apples to those areas But this is only one-third of the amount of apples exported from Tasmania during that same period. Every other State virtually looks after its own home market. Each is very pleased to do so and it feels that it can stay in business doing just that. But what they all fear most is the enormous surplus on the Tasmanian market. I do not think that even if it is selfish, there is much wrong with the attitude of South Australian growers when they say that we should try to look after the export of apples from Tasmania. In the Bill before the House the Government aims to give help to those areas that are most vulnerable. The Government intends to give help to those sales made on open consignment, sales made aboard a vessel in transit and sales termed consignment against advance payments. In other words, only a partial payment will be made in that case. The Government, for instance, in this scheme dors not aim to give help to forward sales because they are not subject to the same risk as the other categories which I have just described. I would like to quote briefly from the Minister's second reading speech in relation to that point. He said: If the average export return of a season for a variety falls below its average export support price, then a payment will be made from the relevant fund to the owner of the fruit. If the average export return for a variety exceeds the support price, then owners will be levied to make a contribution to the relevant fund. If, at any time, the balance in a stabilisation fund is insufficient to make the necessary payment to. owners, the Commonwealth Government will meet the deficiency. The contribution to the appropriate varietal fund by the owner of the fruit, where a contribution is called for, will be on a sliding scale up to a maximum of 80c per bushel. The Commonwealth's aggregate liability in respect of the fruit of a season will be related to the total quantity of fruit of that season exported on risk. I have described the categories that fall into that area of risk. The Minister went on: The basic limitation is a total quantity of 4.4 million bushels, which could attract a maximum payment of 80c per bushel. As the quantity exported at risk goes above 4.4 million bushels, the maximum rale of payment per bushel wil] be reduced pro rata . . . Insofar as that is the case, it is a payment scheme based very much on the cotton deficiency payments scheme, which is the sort of scheme that merits the support, I think, of most honourable members. It is not an open cheque scheme. Its aim is to help the apple industry over a 5-year period, and the cost is assessed at SlOm over that period. Might I hasten to add for those who are interested that once again this is below the amount of money taken from wine grape growers under the excuse of an excise scheme recently brought into being, although through a deficiency in sales the amount to be raised under that .scheme is down, I think from memory, from the average assessed figure of $15.2m per year. It is down for the reason that will be apparent to honourable members if they stop to think about it for a minute. There is a second novel feature of this scheme. Again I quote from the second reading speech of the Minister, who said: . . . proceeds from forward sales Those are non-risk sales in respect of which there is no deficiency paymentwill be brought into the calculation of the rate of people's goods cannot be sold then the will be brought into the calculation of the return per bushel from export sales against which the Government's guarantee on consignment sales is lo be matched. 1 have no particular comment to make in relation to that statement other than to say that I accept the fact that this is unconventional. I accept the fact that this scheme and the basis of it was a matter of negotiation between the industry and the Government over a period of 3 years. Many other facets of this scheme should perhaps be debated. For instance, I know that in my own State and in my own area thc scheme has no real implication in respect of pears-whethe r we are considering the production of pears, the export of pears or the risk consignment of pears. The honourable member for Murray devoted most of his speech to the question of the very real difficulty created by enormous surpluses of pears in the State of Victoria. The situation calls for a lot of sympathy, and I must admit that in due course I should like to see consideration given to providing some form of payment in some of these areas to encourage people to pull out pear trees. I hope that if this does occur it will not overlap the apple industry. In passing, might I say that one of the ber for Dawson. 1 would remind the honIn passing, might I say that one of problems confronting the apple, pear and ourable member for Angas that he should problems confronting the apple, pear vine growing areas and many other rural familiarise himself with a statement made vine growing areas and many other rural production areas is that these industries are by his own State Premier. production areas is that these industries not quite like factories. They cannot very well put men off if sales decrease; they cannot very well turn down the wheel to limit production. Trees have been planted and their is investment in an area which is subject perhaps to 25 years of production. If any reason is needed in anybody's mind as to why this scheme which we are discussing tonight should be introduced, let us remember that a lifetime of investment and savings by some people has been put into this form of production, und it is neither lightly turned off nor does one lightly liquidate or cast aside savings or investment of a lifetime. Perhaps 1 might sum up briefly by saying that there will be people who may feel that the Government is not expending taxpayers' funds to the best advantage. I would not class myself as one of these. I can think of industries growing in production in this country because of Government help and Government payments. If rate of people's goods cannot be sold then the Government should not encourage greater production. But this is not so in this scheme. As I see it, the deficiency payment as currently set will allow the efficient to continue to produce, particularly if more efficient handling schemes can be discovered and put into effect. However, the scheme will not allow the less efficient easily to continue in production, and this is the way, I maintain, any responsible government must act. To do more would flood markets and bring ruin to all in the industry; to do less would not take into account the welfare of apple producers who are disadvantaged by high wages, high costs and other matters which tbey believe-an d I think rightly so-hav e come about through no fault of their own. I support the Bill before the House. Mr SHERRY (Franklin) (9.56)-M r Deputy Speaker, I want to make a comment about a remark made by the honourable member for Angas ( Mr Giles). It was made with his customary charm. He said, in accusing Ihe honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson), that people in his State would not accept the proposition being put forward by the honourable memthe ber for Dawson. 1 would remind the honand ourable member for Angas that he should familiarise himself with a statement made are by his own State Premier. Mr Giles-Tha t does not mean a thing. Mr SHERRY-Despit e the interjection of the honourable member for Angas, his State Premier has indicated that in the long term he would support the proposition put forward by the Premier of Tasmania for a single national marketing authority. That disposes of that. In supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dawson I do so with the desire not to impede or to obstruct the legislation before the House, but rather as one motivated by a very deep concern for the future of this industry which affects thousands of people in my own State and more particularly in my own electorate. Indeed, it affects the whole economy of the State of Tasmania and the future of the welfare of so many of the people of that State. The Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr Sinclair) in his second reading speech on 19th August 1971 summed up the aims of the Bill, I think, in the final paragraph when he said: I said earlier tbat this stabilisation scheme will hear that the Minister in Hobart only on I said earlier tbat this stabilisation scheme not solve all the industry's problems. However I believe it is a fair and just scheme and will give the industry considerable assistance. We of the Opposition very sincerely hope that in fact the Minister's hopes will be realised. We might at this stage ask: Why is this Bill necessary? What problems have brought about the current crisis? Let there be no mistake-i t is a crisis. But tonight I want to deal in the main with 2 points in particular that I think are germane to the issues involved. The first is the marketing of the product and the second is the recurring cost structure, with particular regard to freights. Of course first of all there is the cost of commodities such as chemical spray materials which I shall mention later. Let me first of all deal with marketing and therefore it would be premature to Let me first of all deal with marketing techniques or rather the absence of marmake any detailed comment on it. But I techniques or rather the absence of keting techniques. The overwhelming majority of growers fhat the Australian Apple and Pear Board The overwhelming majority of growers in Tasmania have now realised and acted has confirmed that this decision is unaniin Tasmania have now realised and acted upon the realisation that an apple and pear mous and will operate. But it can be upon the realisation that an apple and marketing authority is their prime hope of clearly demonstrated that the existing marmarketing authority is their prime hope of survival. Mr Grassby-Thei r only hope. Mr SHERRY-I t is indeed their only they have acted correctly and acted couraMr SHERRY-I t is indeed their only hope, as my good friend from Riverina geously. The examples of New Zealand, hope, as my good friend from Riverina interjects. The growers have been well South Africa and British Columbia are interjects. The growers have been well aware of the fragmentation of marketing there for all of us to see. It is time we aware of the fragmentation of marketing and they have presented sound ancl concise suggestions for development and organisation of the marketing techniques. They have had representatives in New Zealand looking at the obvious advantages enjoyed by that country. They have co-operated admirably with the Tasmanian State Government in the inquiry conducted by the Grant Committee which was referred to by my colleague, the honourable member for Wilmot ( Mr Duthie). They have urged the implementation of the Committee's recommendation for the establishment of a single marketing authority. Let me repeat that the great and overwhelming majority of the growers in the industry have urged the Tasmanian Government to implement the recommendation of the Grant report. Predictably, the Tasmanian Government has stubbornly refused to act upon this. So it can be seen quite clearly that the mdustry is very well aware of the difficulties and has acted and is continuing to act in a responsible manner. Therefore it is somewhat surprising and, I think, distressing to will hear that the Minister in Hobart only on Monday of last week offered the growers a rather gratuitous piece of advice. He said to them: 'You put your house in order.* This is precisely what they are attempting to do. The very real tragedy is that this industry is dominated by a contingent of exporters who call the tune season after season. It is very interesting to note that the Australian Apple and Pear Board announced over the weekend that it will issue only one export licence for the State of Tasmania. This has been referred to by previous speakers. It is a very radical move. It may well be successful. We hope it is. The precise details are as yet unknown and therefore it would be premature to marmake any detailed comment on it. But I have been informed as late as this evening fhat the Australian Apple and Pear Board has confirmed that this decision is unanipear mous and will operate. But it can be clearly demonstrated that the existing marketing system has failed-an d failed abysmally. The growers recognise this fact and they have acted accordingly. In my view, they have acted correctly and acted courageously. The examples of New Zealand, South Africa and British Columbia are there for all of us to see. It is time we took note of their success and of our own continuing failures and weaknesses in marketing techniques. I turn briefly now to the question of freights. The very geographical isolation of Tasmania has always rendered it vulnerable to the whims and the fancies of the overseas shipping companies. Freight is perhaps the highest single cost factor involved in the export of apples and pears. The final indignity was perpetrated last week when, in a take it or leave it, gun at the head attitude, it was conveyed to the industry that unless a 24 per cent increase in freight rates was forthcoming the shipping lines would have nothing to do with it. This matter, as I understand it, is unresolved. I would urge the Minister and the Government to act decisively and responsibly with regard to this blatant piece of economic blackmail, because that is precisely what it is. Tasmania does not enjoy and has never enjoyed the largesse bestowed upon the mainland States in the field of road and rail subsidies. 1 make an appeal in this speech for a total freight freeze for the Tasmanian fruit industry and, if not a freight freeze, then a subsidy to protect the economy and welfare of the Tasmanian people. Other States have enjoyed this privilege. Why should Tasmania be left out and isolated? Tasmania is vulnerable and becomes more so with each succeeding day. The performance of the Tasmanian industry with regard to its loading rates is excellent. It has one of the best records in the nation. There is an industrial harmony during the season that should be a model for the rest of the nation. Here I think it apppropriate to quote a letter which demonstrates that very point. It is a letter from the acting chairman of the State Fruit Board of Tasmania, Mr Clark, to the secretary of the Hobart branch of the Waterside Workers Federation, which appeared in the 'Australian' last week. I would like honourable gentlemen on the other side of the House to listen to this, because so often in this House we hear about the outrageous behaviour of the trade unions with regard to primary industry. Mr Clark said that Tasmanian loading rates were the highest in Australia for fruit cargoes. He went on to say: The industry achieved an average loading rate pulation this Government has long proThe industry achieved an average loading throughout Australia of 13,064 bushels, thus claimed on numerous occasions its belief in throughout Australia of 13,064 bushels, thus becoming entitled to a 7c per bushel rebate. 20369/71-Jt-167 ] The interesting thing is that southern Tasmania again topped the list with a daily rate of 15,156 bushels. Mr Clark went on to express his appreciation in writing to the Waterside Workers Federation for its co-operation. This point must be mentioned because it clearly demonstrates that all facets of the industry are conscious, are well aware, that the prosperity of the State is paramount, and they act in a totally responsible fashion. We all know of the great many problems that confront the industry. They are many and manifold. In 1967 the disastrous bushfires caused havoc in this particular industry. Now some of the growers arefindingthat the repayment of fire loans is creating tremendous problems for them. I would like to suggest that the Federal Government write off these fire loans. On top of the hail and frost damage the growers in Franklin have no hope at all of meeting this crippling extra burden. I want to turn now to the very human problems involved-th e depopulation of many areas, the pressures on families, the dislocation, the frustrations and the uncertainties that will emerge if we continue to denude the rural areas. ThefiguresI have are not up to date because it is impossible to get the immediatefigures;but they do give a very clear indication of what is happening in that part of the electorate In the Huon area which, as the Minister and many honourable members will be well aware, is the heart of the fruit growing area of Franklin and indeed of southern Tasmania, the population stood at 5,460 in 1961. It is now down below 5,000. In Cygnet the population has dropped to about 2,400. In the general area, in a period of 9 years, the loss from this industry alone is well over 1,000 people and is continuing daily. It is not a single, isolated effect that occurs. It is not merely a fruit grower leaving. It is the effect it has throughout the economy. The butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker all are affected when this mass migration continues to occur within the rural sector. This trend is accelerating. In talking with people in the electorate in the last few days, I could see and appreciate the heartbreak of a great industry being destroyed by external forces and circumstances. On this very problem of deporate pulation this Government has long proclaimed on numerous occasions its belief in decentralisation. We now bave the spectre of rural ghost towns, of agricultural wastelands, as people are being forced to the great city environments, not of their own volition but because of Government ineptitude in policy. Is this the iegacy of Liberal-Country Party rule? Is this the great vision of decentralisation, when people are forced out of an industry they have created with their own vigour, their own intelligence, and their own capability and capacity, to an environment that they do not want and an environment that is incapable of supporting them? The apple and pear industry in Tasmania has made a very great contribution to the welfare of this nation, and the people in that industry want the opportunity to continue to do just that-an d they have every right to continue. They are people of immense courage and determination, and they are people of undoubted skill. They have produced the world's best product and they have a right to sell it. They have a right to sell it because twothirds of the world at the moment is underfed and is crying out for food. It seems to me to be a most paradoxical and ludicrous situation that here we are denud- mania. Reluctant as I am to do so, I feel I ludicrous situation that here we are denuding the rural areas, telling people not to produce, when in point of fact in 2 or 3 years time we may be saying precisely the opposite. Mr Grassby-Eightee n months, I think. Mr SHERRY-Perhap s less than that. Growers in the towns in my electorate will and can produce the goods if this national Parliament and this national Government give the visionary leadership that is so vital. Let me make one brief comment on the costs of chemical spray materials, for example. It can be seen, by reading the relapples and pears are very substantially, not example. It can be seen, by reading the relapples evant documents that are available, that in New Zealand growers pay up to 50 per cent less for their chemical spray materials In fact the only congestion which occurs in cent less for their chemical spray materials than do my own growers in Franklin. Of course this is a situation that exacerbates an existing problem-on e problem on top of another. I hope that the Government will move with some alacrity and that its mobility wiil be in evidence. I hope that there will be more alacrity in evidence than that displayed by the Prime Minister ( Mr MCMahon) in this House last week when I asked him a question about the national marketing authority and he did not know anything about it. Mr Grassby-H e lost the letter. Mr SHERRY-H e lost the letter. He mislaid his mail. The Premier of Tasmania, I have no doubt, was not very happy with that little bit of delightful news and carelessness that he received from the Prime Minister. Time is no longer on the industry's side. I know from personal experience that this industry will respond and can respond. It is up to this Government to evoke that response with an understanding of and a sensitivity to this industry's problems. The industry needs decisive and determined action, and it needs such action now and not in the future. On that basis I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dawson. Dr SOLOMON (Denison) (10.15)-W e have heard from my compatriots, the honourable members for Wilmot ( Mr Duthie) and Franklin ( Mr Sherry), a concerted attempt, quite apart from that made by the honourable member of Dawson (Dr Patterson), who led for the Opposition, to pin the deficiencies of this particular line of production on either the Commonwealth Government or the Government of Tasmania. Reluctant as I am to do so, I feel I must take up in due course some of the points made by my 2 colleagues on the other side of the House, because I do not believe that they contained very much economic logic at all. But before I do that may I explain why it is that I am talking on this subject. It is clear that the honourable member for Franklin has in his electorate a majority of Australian and certainly Tasmanian apple and pear production. However those and pears are very substantially, not quite exclusively, exported through the port of Hobart, which is in my electorate. In fact the only congestion which occurs in the port of Hobart is, roughly speaking, during the months from March to May when ships tie up in the stream awaiting a berth at our relatively small but very well reputed port from the point of view of its physical capacity. This is therefore a matter of some significance to the people of the city of Hobart as well as to the people of tbe Huon Valley and thereabouts. If in fact the bottom drops out of the apple and pear industry, and notably the export part of it, a very considerable decline will take place in the activities of the port of Hobart, not to mention those associated areas which are involved in the marketing of apples and pears. There are many difficulties in trying to implement the proposals as presently envisaged in either the Government legislation or in fact in the amendment as proposed by the honourable member for Dawson. I think it is only fair to say- I perhaps vary a little from my friend, the honourable member for Angas ( Mr Giles), here-tha t there is real logic in the proposition that we should have a single national marketing authority for the distribution and export of pome fruits. But it is not as simple as it sounds or as simple as my friends from Tasmania who have spoken earlier this evening would have us believe, because there is involved not only the question of constitutionality but also questions of finance, by whom rt should be done and how it should be done. If in fact the recommendation of the Grant Board of Inquiry were to be implemented, that is to say, the recommendation for a State marketing authority, that in itself would present considerable problem. We have heard a deal from the honourable members for Franklin and Wilmot about governmental procrastination, which I think they levied roughly equally at the State and Federal Governments but perhaps more so at the present Tasmanian Government. But as I recall they failed to mention anything- I noted down the appropriate things that they said-abou t the financial implications of setting up such an authority. May I point out that if we set up either a State or Federal authority, but let us take a State one first because that is the Grant Board's recommendation, such an authority would assume the functions of the licensed exporters who have been enumerated already in this debate, who currently largely finance the production and presentation costs and guarantee the payment of freight on that portion of the pome fruits which are exported on consignment, that is, as I understand it, at risk. That involves a considerable amount of finance. Such an authority, if set up, would require considerable seasonal finance. Estimates place the figure as high as about 117m annually. Dr Everingham-Hav e you heard of the Commonwealth Bank? Dr SOLOMON- I have indeed. We are talking about real money. It is interesting that honourable members opposite have failed to discuss that particular aspect of the matter, assuming presumably that it grows on trees, if not on apple trees and that it would be a very simple operation to implement this thing. As I said, there is indeed logic in doing this but I have a certain apprehension about ultimates in bureaucracy. We know very well the propensity of honourable members opposite to set up commissions or boards or whathave-you to run practically everything in this country and they have, however happily or unhappily for the growers concerned, or realistically, totally ignored the fact that this has been for a century or more a private enterprise operation and that private enterprise operators expect to have certain ups and downs in consequence of their chosen-i n fact the nation's chosen - metho d of economic operation. In saying that- I will not beat about the bush or pretend that it is not possible to offend some growers in the Huon Valley or anywhere else- I must also say that I do not think I can remember a year in my Tasmanian experience when one of the more courageous or forthright members of the industry- I will not mention nameshas gone against the general tide and said: There are deficiencies in the marketing of our product. It is time we rationalised it.' I have heard that for at least a dozen years successively-on e of the hardiest annuals to come my way. Yet the honourable member for Franklin can say that the majority of growers are pushing for the implementation of the Board's recommendation while the Tasmanian Government resists it. It seems to me, as far as I have evidence, that the Tasmanian Government is doing its utmost in the year or less since the Board's recommendations came forward tofindways and means, with or without Federal assistance, to implement the major recommendations. It is not true that the majority of growers have been pushing for the implementation of such recommendations as the Board made for year after year. If the majority of small growers had it would have quickly come about and in particular it would haye come about under the previous Labor Government in Tasmania which held office for 35 years until May 1969. When I say that I do not wish to be misinterpreted although I am quite sure I will be quoted out of context in due course by somebody. I do not mean to suggest that those in the industry who are suffering difficulties, as most are, are not deserving of assistance, nor do I wish to do anything but advocate as much assistance as is possible and sensible economically to give. One of the difficulties is that in many, if not all, agricultural pursuits there is a great deal of difference between what happens to the big and small growers. Among his other factual statements the honourable member for Dawson gave us some useful figures on the distribution of incomes among growers. I noted only one, and that is that 7 per cent of growers earn in excess of $10,000 annually- a reputable sort of figure-and that of course a great deal larger proportion are in receipt of half or less of that amount. Herein, of course, lies the problem- a problem which has already been experienced by the berry fruit industry in southern Tasmania and elsewhere and, as honourable members wil] know, even in the wool industry. Any form of price support, subsidy or producing, as somebody preceding me has Any form of price support, subsidy whatever designed to help the marginal or already said, unwanted varieties of whatever designed to help the marginal small grower is likely to help the big grower apples-uncompetitiv e and unmarketable small grower is likely to help the big grower more and perhaps not to help the small varieties-fo r markets on the other side of more and perhaps not to help the small grower enough. This is an intractable probthe world merely to try to keep people on grower enough. This is an intractable probthe lem unless we operate a sliding scale of the land. lem unless we operate a sliding scale of the land. values and in effect apply a means test according to size, income and what-haveyou to the growers concerned. So in that is remarkably suited climatically and in you to the growers concerned. So in that sense we have a problem that this or any several other ways to the production of sense we have a problem that this or any other government of any colour will not pome fruits to the extent that it produces other government of any colour will not find easy to solve. It does not, however, some of the best cropping in the world and find easy to solve. It does not, however, mean that we should not be looking, as the certainly far above the Australian average, mean that we should not be looking, as the Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr Sinit is in fact suited to some other forms of Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr Sinit clair) certainly is with the Prime Minister production. Its river flats and slopes clair) certainly is with the Prime Minister ( Mr MCMahon) and others, to see just how already produce hops and other crops ( Mr MCMahon) and others, to see just we can best solve this problem. I think it apart from pome fruits. In an earlier we can best solve this problem. I think inappropriate- I regret having to raise yet period of this century something like 95 inappropriate- I regret having to raise another point-t o do this, but having per cent of cropping in the Huon Valley another point-t o do this, but having already seen my friend the honourable was in pome fruits. Since that time the relalready seen my friend the honourable was member for Franklin make much of the ative importance of pome fruits has member for Franklin make much of the fact that the Prime Minister seemed to be declined. The yields have increased but the fact that the Prime Minister seemed to be unaware of one letter which had come to area has been somewhat less stocked by unaware of one letter which had come him but which in fact was shown within those fruits. It is clear from the economic him but which in fact was shown within the next second to have been immediately circumstances that there will have to be the next second to have been immediately within the awareness of the Minister for alternative forms of production thought of within the awareness of the Minister for Primary Industry, I find it incredible that in the Huon Valley. That of course again Primary Industry, I find it incredible that he should again raise the issue tonight as if it were one of great substance. It seemed to me to indicate a grave deficiency in emphasis on the economics of this problem rather that fhe peripheral politics. We bave in fact a situation here whereby an industry, in the case of Tasmania- I trust others will forgive me for not talking about other parts of Austra? lia-represent s something over $20m of value to the Tasmanian economy and generates, as the Minister said in his speech, something between 45 per cent and 60 per cent of agricultural earnings for the State and produces something over 70 per cent of Australian exports in this field of production, tbat is, of pome fruits. So we are not talking about small peas as far as the Tasmanian economy is concerned. In that I agree with previous speakers, in particular the honourable members for Wilmot and Franklin. But it is something which has to be faced as an economic problem. It is, of course, as all these problems are in the ultimate, a human problem, but again the answer is not to fulminate about agricultural wastelands and decentralisation and attribute those to Government ineptitude. It would be the height of folly to attempt by infinite levels of support, stabilisation or what-have-you to have people or producing, as somebody preceding me has or already said, unwanted varieties of apples-uncompetitiv e and unmarketable varieties-fo r markets on the other side of world merely to try to keep people on Although the Huon Valley of Tasmania is remarkably suited climatically and in several other ways to the production of pome fruits to the extent that it produces some of the best cropping in the world and certainly far above the Australian average, is in fact suited to some other forms of production. Its river flats and slopes how already produce hops and other crops it apart from pome fruits. In an earlier yet period of this century something like 95 per cent of cropping in the Huon Valley in pome fruits. Since that time the relative importance of pome fruits has declined. The yields have increased but the to area has been somewhat less stocked by those fruits. It is clear from the economic circumstances that there will have to be alternative forms of production thought of in the Huon Valley. That of course again does not leave us with a situation where we should not do our utmost to implement a rational scheme of marketing- a scheme which, as has been proposed in the legislation, will minimise the weaknesses of the industry, will consolidate the operations, will tend to focus quite specifically on particular varietal forms of production and therefore there will be an incentive for growers to produce those varieties which offer them the best returns under a rationalised system rather than the, relatively speaking, pig in a poke method of producing this or that variety, shipping it long distances and hoping it will produce a decent sort of price to cover costs and a bit more on the other side of the world. ft is not true, 1 must say in all conscience, that we produce unequivocally the best apples in the world. I have sampled some in European markets. I have seen the British public go for South African Granny Smiths almost to the exclusion of others on the market at a particular time. We do in fact produce magnificent apples but they are not all as magnificent as each other. We have long since, I think, put our heads in the sand, particularly in respect of South African competition. I can remember being fn Britain in 1963 and 1964 and I can recall the predictions that were made then that the South African crop was being extended in its seasonality to the point where it was already encroaching on that part of the season on which the Australian production had almost a monopoly or at least a very good share. It was feared even then-tha t was 7 years or 8 years ago-tha t it might well advance into the Australian sector of the British market, which is still our major one, and cut us out in this regard. That prediction has not come about as quickly or as completely as was thought at that time. This is very well for us. But I think that it would be unfair to this Government or to the Tasmanian Government to suggest that the writing has not been on the wall. As I said earlier, it has been a minority of courageous growers, among whom I can recall one ex-member of the Tasmanian Parliament- I do not think that he lost his seat for that reason-wh o annually used to say this sort of thing: 'Unless we rationalise our operations and market our things in the way in which other people tend to market their products, particularly in distant markets, we will face problems'. The problems are with us now. Again I think that we must solve them to the very best of our ability. But self-help, as the Minister said in southern Tasmania a week or two ago, is part and parcel of the deal. We cannot achieve an economically viable proposition in which Government handouts-subsidies , price supports or stabilisation schemes, whatever they are calledare the only factors. It is nice to see that the Apple and Pear Board, in terms of its consortium proposition, and other elements concerned with this whole operation, not the least the growers, have grasped the bull by the horns or shaken the apple tree, whatever is the appropriate description, to produce a solution which I believe could well have been produced by private enterprise itself long since. It is not, I believe, sumcient to say that the Government, whichever the government is, should have done this. This is an operation in which, in the characteristic fashion of this Government, we have consulted with industry, have seen its views, have been given advice and have taken it or not as the case may be. But it is not good enough to say: 'Look at this parlous situation that we are in now. The Government has been most deficient in its duty. Ten years ago it should have forced on the industry one or another scheme'. Now may I take up 2 or 3 points which have been made and I believe are worthy of criticism. The honourable member for Wilmot speaks of the initiative of the Rural Committee of the Australian Labor Party. Would that that Committee had done as much as the Liberal rural committee under Mr Ashton-Jones and others. 1 believe that it is of very recent advent indeed and that it is not valid to claim that Government procrastination was responsible for the initiative taken by that Committee. The honourable member for Wilmot and the honourable member for Franklin mentioned the paramount role of freight. One of them went on to say that we should have one brand exported in bulk, thereby saving up to 30c or so a bushel. That is worth doing. But if in fact freight is the paramount problem, the relatively minor consolidation of loading operations and savings thereby will not make the difference which the honourable member would wish for. The honourable member wishes to see the rationalisation of brands and container operations. With those proposals I have great sympathy. But, at the same time, the honourable member wishes to sprinkle trade commissioners all around the East. I wonder whether that wish is compatible with the desire to consolidate the productive enterprise of the industry, because if we have a proliferation of trade commissioners we may again have our old State by State competition instead of having an Australian situation. Surely if the Australian Labor Party moves an amendment seeking a national marketing authority it would be a bright idea to think in terms of having a national push, through whatever trade commissioner is operating, in the appropriate ports of sale. May I suggest that if we move a trade commissioner from London to Singapore the profitability of the market of 2 million people in Singapore will not supplant the British market or the European market generally. I agree with the proposal for an East Asian market, including, if we can, Japan and China. This proposal should be developed. Again, this proposal is of at least 10 years' standing. In fact, in a paper touching on the apple export industry, I had the enjoyment at one stage of drawing attention to this point and showing on a little map just how small our exports of this product were to the East Asian region. That was nearly 10 years ago. Yet the market has not grown very much. There is obvious room for private enterprise and governmental promotion in the area. But, as other people have said, I think that we will be lucky if we make up the deficiencies which may occur now in the European area. Mr DAVIES (Braddon) (10.35)- I have no desire to be unkind to the honourable member for Denison (Dr Solomon). But the honourable member questioned the availability of finance and the position of the Constitution with regard to the setting up of a marketing authority. It is to be regretted, I think, that he and others on the other side of the House do not keep in touch with leaders of industry and, in particular, leaders of the industry that we are discussing tonight. Had they done this, they would have been supplied with a very fine exposition setting out the cost of the authority, the question of constitutional powers and so on. A number of their fears would have been shown to be groundless. In his second reading speech on the Apple and Pear Stabilisation Bill, the Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr Sinclair) referred at length to the industry in Tasmania. I think that, at the outset, I should place on record the considered opinion of the Apple and Pear Growers Federation on the stabilisation plan. The Federation considers stabilisation a very necessary support plan to replace devaluation assistance. However, it nowhere near makes up for the loss experienced by growers through Australia's failure to devalue when Britain did. The plan gives a breathing space during whioh it is hoped to make the necessary drastic moves to reorganise the marketing of apples. One of these moves occurred at the weekend when the Australian Apple and Pear Board decided to issue one export licence to Tasmania with the 19 exporters working in a type of consortium. It is considered a very necessary adjunct to a marketing scheme such as that proposed in the Grant Report. The Federation considers, however, that the stabilisation plan has its weaknesses. One of these weaknesses is that it operates on the basis of an average Australian price and takes no account of the wide inequality of market returns experienced by different growers for the same quantity of fruit. The Federation points out that it will need to continue as planned and the amount of support may have to be increased to compensate for costs that are increasing and which are beyond the control of growers. I think that I should reiterate the value of the apple and pear industry to the economy of the State of Tasmania. I agree with the leaders of industry that, comparatively speaking, the apple and pear industry is more valuable to the State of Tasmania than the wool industry is the economy of the Australian nation. In recent years, the apple and pear industry has been worth between Si6m and $20m annually. It provides between 45 and .60 per cent of agricultural earnings and 12 per cent to 15 per cent of the total incomes from rural primary industries, including timber and mining. There has been a trend to decrease acreage but to increase production as yields have improved. The average yield per .bearing acre in Tasmania 2 years ago was about 500 bushels of apples as against the Australian average of 300 bushels. In the same year, Tasmania produced 32 per cent of the total production of apples from 19 per cent of the total Australian acreage, that is, 7 million bushels out of a total of 22 million bushels. On an average over the past 5 years, Tasmania has provided 36 per cent of Australian apple production, but 70 per cent of apple exports. It has provided 7 per cent of Australian pear production but 21 per cent of pear exports. Of Tasmania's production over the past 5 years, 76 per cent of apples and 83 per cent of pears were exported. However, all is not well with the industry. Gloom and depression have settled over it. The industry is carried on in the Huon, Derwent, Tamar and Mersey Valleys. From the Statistician's figures of 1966, only 75 per cent of Tasmanian orchardists are still on their properties. It is a fact that $2,513 of the average net farm income of are still on their properties. It is a fact 100 families have left the Huon Valley in the past 18 months. This emphasises the very serious situation that exists. The Apple and Pear Growers Federation has referred to the stabilisation plan envisaged in the present legislation as a support scheme to replace devaluation. I might add that it is a very poor support scheme at that. For many years, we enjoyed the benefits that came from the difference in currency values. The old English £1 was worth 25s Australian when we received the returns for fruit sold in the United Kingdom. This bonus, as it were, of 25 per cent was the cream on the skim milk and for years the industry prospered. Certainly we had bad years. I well remember friends of mine receiving a bill of 2s 6d for 250 cases of apples sold in the old country but these were the exceptions rather than the general rule. However, 2 matters have caused the prelion bushels. So by working on the formula However, 2 matters have caused the prelion sent downturn in the industry. The first 4.4 multiplied by 80c divided by 7.5 the sent downturn in the industry. The first was the devaluation of the English cursupport price for this season will mean a was the devaluation of the English cursupport rency. When this happened in 1967 the return of 47c to the grower if his fruit rency. When this happened in 1967 the cream for us was gone. As the present does not reach the price listed in column 2 cream for us was gone. As the present Minister for the Interior said at that time, of the Second Schedule of the Act. And of Minister for the Interior said at that time, this Government had thrown the primary course, in many cases, the fruit will not this Government had thrown the primary industries to the wolves. He accused the reach the prices listed in the Second industries to the wolves. He accused present Prime Minister of smothering the Schedule and so all the grower can expect present Prime Minister of smothering the devastating damage done to our export is 47c in place of the previous devaluation devastating damage done to our export industries under a flood of high sounding compensation of around 50c per bushel. I industries under a flood of high sounding economic jargon. And he was right at the spoke with some exporters in the Huon economic jargon. And he was right at time but he has been very silent on this Valley last week and they estimated a time but he has been very silent on this matter ever since. This Government, in its decision not to devalue, agreed to compensate growers and paid about 50c per bushel for apples and pears consigned to devalued markets. But the damage had been done. In the first year following devaluation, 1968, some 68 per cent of growers in northern Tasmania had net farm incomes below S2.000 per annum, despite the fact that they received on an average about $1,900 per orchard in devaluation compensation. If you take out the devaluation compensation the net return for the year was only $100. If there had been no devaluation compensation, growers in northern Tasmania in 1968 would have had a net farm income of minus $1,200. Growers in southern Tasmania would have been little better off with a net farm income of plus S600. Taken over the whole State of Tasmania in 1968 devaluation payments represented that $2,513 of the average net farm income of $2,744 for each orchard. These figures come from the survey conducted by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. From this it can be seen that devaluation compensation has helped, but not enough, and now it is to be replaced by a support scheme through stabilisation. The support price this year will be even less than the devaluation compensation. So how are they to exist? The Bill before us provides that the basic limitation of fruit forwarded on consignment is a total quantity of 4.4 million bushels. This quantity could attract the maximum payment of 80c per bushel. As the quantity exported at risk goes above 4.4 million bushels, the maximum rate of payment per bushel will be reduced pro rata. Mr Jenkins of the Australian Apple and Pear Board announced recently that the quantity forwarded on consignment this last season amounted to 7.5 milbushels. So by working on the formula 4.4 multiplied by 80c divided by 7.5 the price for this season will mean a return of 47c to the grower if his fruit does not reach the price listed in column 2 of the Second Schedule of the Act. And of course, in many cases, the fruit will not the reach the prices listed in the Second Schedule and so all the grower can expect is 47c in place of the previous devaluation compensation of around 50c per bushel. I the spoke with some exporters in the Huon Valley last week and they estimated a stabilisation return of about 45c. If, as the BAE survey showed, we were going from bad to worse with the 50c odd under devaluation, what will be the position when this is reduced to about 45c? 1 have with me the returns only recently received by some growers. The first applies to 173 cartons of Jonathans shiped on the 'Britannic' to Liverpool at an f.o.b. return to the grower of $304.20-a n average of $1.75 per carton. In view of the large quantity shipped from Australia on consignment and the support price for jonathans as listed in the Second Schedule being $2.58, this grower can expect to receive an additional 47c from the pool, making a total of $2.22 f.o.b. for his fruit. It costs a grower $2.91 to put a case of apples on the wharf in Tasmania, so this grower will show a loss of 69c a bushel even after receiving his contribution from the stabilisation plan. Even with stabilisation he loses $119 on this shipment. For the sake of the record, with the concurrence of honourable members I incorporate in Mansard an analysis of production and marketing costs as determined for the 1971 season in Tasmania. It is on this table that I base my calculations. Production costs: Spray materials .. .. 17 Fertiliser .. .. 10 Labour .. .. 38 Overheads .. .. 11 Harvesting costs: Picking, etc. Presentation costs: Carton .. .. 75 Packing shed labour .. 45 Cool storage .. 16 Country freight . . .. 10 Shipside freight, etc. .. 4 T.F.S.A.C. charges .. 6 Wharfage marine board . . 4 A.A.P.B. levy . . .. 4 Transit insurance .. 0.5 Interest and depreciation . . Total f.o.b. costs Shipping and marketing charges: Exporters commission . . 25 Shipping freight . . $2.23 Importers chargers .. 85 I thank the Minister for his courtesy. Mr SPEAKER-Order ! I have reminded them to the wharf. After taking into Mr SPEAKER-Order ! I have reminded the House a couple of times recently when account his labour, spray and fertiliser the House a couple of times recently when honourable members have asked to have documents incorporated in Hansard that it is not necessary for honourable members to acknowledge the courtesy of a Minister. I again draw the attention of honourable members to this matter. Mr DAVIES-Tha t table itemises the production costs at 76c per bushel. The harvesting costs are 20c; presentation costs $1.65; interest and depreciation 30c. It costs a Tasmanian grower a total of $2.91 to put a case of apples on the wharf in Tasmania. If you add the shipping and marketing charges which come to $3.33 the total cost is $6.24 which the grower must receive in the United Kingdom before he makes a penny for himself. From this, it can be seen it costs $1.65 simply to present a carton of apples and this does not allow for any return to the grower for his labour, sprays or fertilisers and all the expenses that go to putting the fruit on tbe trees. He has to get $2.91 at the wharf before he breaks even. The exporter in Tasmania takes 25c for every carton. The freight to the United Kingdom is $2.23 per carton. The person who sells the carton in the United Kingdom gets 85c. And all this means that the c c grower who sells at risk must get $6.24 for each carton overseas before he breaks even. Herein lies another weakness in the stabilisation plan. It is related to f.o.b. returns and has no relation to shipping and 76 marketing charges in the United Kingdom 20 and on the Continent. These can continue to sky-rocket as they have in recent years and the grower has no control over them and yet we have to face the prospect of another 22 per cent freight increase this year. I simply ask: How many people in the United Kingdom can afford to pay $6.24 for a carton of Tasmanian apples, and this charge is soon to be increased to $1.65 almost $7 if the freight increase is to 30 apply? $2.91 I turn to another export return. This grower receives $150.31 for 103 cartons of jonathans shipped in the 'Britannic' to Hamburg. This gives him a return of $1.46 $3.33 f.o.b. and does not even cover the presentation costs of $1.64. In other words he is $6.24 down the drain 20c a carton simply after packing them in a carton and transporting them to the wharf. After taking into account his labour, spray and fertiliser costs, he will lose $1.45 on each carton and this loss will be reduced to $1 after he receives his contribution from the stabilisasupport price because it costs the same receives his contribution from the stabilisasupport tion plan. The grower does all the work and takes all the risks, yet the middle-men and the freight people take all the profit. Let me point out the expenses in connection with this shipment of 103 cartons in another way to highlight how everyone else gets his cut and the grower is forced to take what is left over-an d as I have pointed out, this left over will not cover his costs of production. The main expenses for this shipment are: Freight $229.69-min d you that is for 103 cartons; the freight charge was $229.69; exporters fee $25.75; importers commission $31.50; handling charges $34.75; landing charges $41.62. The fruit realised $525.55 but charges after leaving Tasmania amounted to approximately $374. Thus the grower is left with $150 to cover all the expenses of his own labour, packing and presentation costs and freight in getting his 103 cartons on to the wharf in Tasmania ready for export. In other words, the expenses after leaving Tasmania amounted to 75 per cent of what the fruit brought overseas and to me this is the weakness in the stabilisation plan because the grower is still at the mercy of the shipping companies and fruit importers and exporters. There is no doubt in my mind that the tion. 1 have some knowledge of the There is no doubt in my mind that figure of 4.4 million as appearing in fruit industry, having been associated with figure of 4.4 million as appearing in section 11, sub-section 2 (b) of the Bill is a fourth generation fruit growing family for section 11, sub-section 2 (b) of the Bill totally unrealistic when compared to the over 30 years. The industry prospered right totally unrealistic when compared to the total exports at risk of Australian apples through from the turn of the century to the total exports at risk of Australian apples and pears. Thisfigureshould be amended to 1960s and, contrary to what the Minister and pears. Thisfigureshould be amended a more realistic figure. Much play has been for Primary Industry said in Hobart last a more realistic figure. Much play has been made of the fact that the pool payment to week the industry has put its house in made of the fact that the pool payment the grower is 80c but this is misleading, order with marked improvements in the grower is 80c but this is misleading, and as the quantity on consignment rises harvesting and packing to meet the rising and as the quantity on consignment rises the pool payment is reduced. As I have costs. I admit that it desperately needs a the pool payment is reduced. As I have indicated, the pool payment thi.s year will single marketing authority. Credit must go indicated, the pool payment thi.s year will bc about 47c based on an export figure of to the exporting firms and I deplore the bc about 47c based on an export figure 74million bushels. There is another aspect that amazes me and this is the different support prices for exporting firms which in recent difficult and this is the different support prices various varieties of apples and pears. I years have kept the orchards afloat through various varieties of apples and pears. I know the excuse that the experts put up. A their advances to enable orchardists to buy know the excuse that the experts put up. greater support price is given for granny sprays and manures and packing material greater support price is given for granny smiths but they are going out of popularity. so that the crop can be harvested. Thc smiths but they are going out of popularity. This extra support is to try to encourage Chairman of the State Fruit Board, Mr This extra support is to try to encourage more people to grow them but the returns Walker, also was critical of the Minister's more people to grow them but the returns this year do not indicate that the granny comments in Hobart. The industry has this year do not indicate that the granny smiths warrant this additional support price. 1 cannot see why we did not have the one price because it costs the same amount to grow a bushel of apples whether they are jonathons, stunners or democrats or any other variety. I realise there has been this move to encourage the growing of granny smiths but this move is not justified by thefigures.I consider too that section 7 of the Act relating to support prices for the different varieties of fruit should be amended to allow for the increases in the cost of cartons and wages, components of the f.o.b. price, which have risen since the support prices for last season were determined and listed in column 2 of the Second Schedule of the Act. To illustrate my point, there has been a rise of 6 per cent in national wages since these prices were determined on lst October 1970. The Act provides for the support price for each variety of fruit to be determined on Ist October in the year preceding the export season under consideration. In view of this it is only reasonable to request that an escalating clause or arrangement be included to make provision for any increase in the components of the f.o.b. price for the particular season. 1 have referred to the rot that set in in this industry when this Government decided not to devalue in 1967 and offered the fruit industry compensation for devaluathe tion. 1 have some knowledge of the fruit industry, having been associated with is a fourth generation fruit growing family for over 30 years. The industry prospered right through from the turn of the century to the to 1960s and, contrary to what the Minister for Primary Industry said in Hobart last to week the industry has put its house in order with marked improvements in harvesting and packing to meet the rising costs. I admit that it desperately needs a single marketing authority. Credit must go of to the exporting firms and I deplore the action of the Government members who write them down. Credit must go to these for exporting firms which in recent difficult years have kept the orchards afloat through A their advances to enable orchardists to buy sprays and manures and packing material so that the crop can be harvested. Thc Chairman of the State Fruit Board, Mr Walker, also was critical of the Minister's comments in Hobart. The industry has pruned out the unwanted sizes and varieties to which the Minister referred and the fruit has arrived at overseas markets in better condition than fruit from other countries. As Mr Walker points out, the biggest problem facing the industry is the increase in the basic freight rate. I pointed out that in 1968 the devaluation stacks of returns from the Huon, the Tamar I pointed out that in 1968 the devaluation payments represented $2,513 of the average net orchard income of $2,744, leaving only $213 after the payment for devaluation for a year's hard work in tilling the soil, picking and packing and putting the crop on the seas. I do not know how much longer the industry can continue. Unless the Government accepts the amendment moved by the Opposition there will be a mass exodus of growers. I have not much time remaining. The returns 1 quoted earlier were from an orchard in the Mersey Valley but I draw the attention of honourable members to another case. For 220 cartons of democrats that were sent on the 'Rockhampton Star* to Rotterdam and Florence there was a return of 2,365 Danish florins. The cost of getting them there was 2,783 Danish florins and the debit return to the grower was 418 Danish florins or, converted to our currency, $104.50. That was for 220 cartons of democrats. He had to receive a return of at least $650.20 in order to break even. He had to pay that $650.20, and in addition to that had to pay $104 in order to satisfy the debit that these apples attracted. I close on this point because time is not on my side. I should have liked an opportunity to expand on the single marketing authority in support of the Opposition's amendment I appeal to the Minister, who I think realises that we are in a desperate position. The figures that I have cited prove this to be so. I have stacks of returns from the Huon, the Tamar and the Mersey valleys, if the Minister is interested in them. Mr SPEAKER-Order ! The honourable member's time has expired. Mr Giles- 1 seek the indulgence of the House to withdraw certain remarks that I made during the debate. Mr SPEAKER-Th e honourable member may proceed. Mr Giles- 1 had been told, and 1 said, that 9 ships had been held up in Port Adelaide recently for 10 days. The honourable member for Sturt ( Mr Foster) has informed me that my remark was incorrect and, furthermore, that Port Adelaide has an outstanding record for the small number of hours lost due to strike action of the wharves. If this is so, I certainly withdraw the remarks that I made. Debate (on motion by Mr Corbett) adjourned.

Typewriters: Dvorak Keyboard (Question No. 3469) Dr Everingham asked the Prime Minister, (1) Has bis attention been drawn to reports that the United States Navy, New York Times and others have converted or are converting all their typewriters to the Dvorak simplified keyboard. (2) If so, has it been shown to (a) improve typing speed by one third, (b) halve training time and reduce fatigue, as the fingers of a fast typist would reduce fatigue, as the fingers of a fast typist would travel only one mile a day instead of 20 miles, (c) reduce errors by eliminating 98 per cent of shifts of fingers between rows and (d) increase producof fingers between rows and (d) increase productivity at an estimated $2 million a day for a community the size of Britain's as compared with the standard keyboard which was originally designed to slow down the operator to reduce clashing of type bars.

Decrease of $1.75 a week should be kept in mind that if this Government had not introduced student endowment (which it did in 1964) payments received would have decreased by $1.50 per week per endowed student, over and above the figures shown in the above table. NATION-WIDE SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL NEEDS Information Furnished by NonGovemment Schools In March 1969 the Australian Education Council, made up of the State Ministers for Education, decided that each State Education Department should undertake a survey of its educational needs in primary and secondary education and in the preparation of teachers over a five year period. Because it believed that information about the position of non-government schools was relevant to considerations by both the States and the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth asked the States to include the needs of non-government schools in their surveys. The States did so only under category 9-scholarships , and only in respect of the estimated cost of applying existing policies to expected enrolments in non-government schools over the five years in question 1971 to 1975. Information in respect of the survey of salary costs and funds available to meet Information in respect of the survey government schools was published by the these costs. Details of other recurrent government schools was published by the Australian Education Council in September needs were also invited but this informaAustralian Education Council in September 1970. Subsequently the Commonwealth tion was not provided in sufficient returns 1970. Subsequently the Commonwealth tion sought further information from the States to permit meaningful tables to be comsought further information from the States about government schools and, while this piled. was being obtained, the Department of Education and Science invited non-government schools throughout Australia to provide additional material in an effort to obtain information in a form comparable to that provided for government schools. The present report summarises the information provided by the non-government schools in response to the Department's invitation. That invitation was based, without comment, on the method and scope of the survey conducted by the Australian Education Council for government schools. Questionnaires were addressed to Catholic education authorities and to individual non-Catholic schools. Returns requested by 22 February 1971, but a number of returns received after this date was included in the final compilation. Returns included in the compilation represented all Catholic schools (one return having been received from each State for of these headings was further divided having been received from each State all Catholic Schools in that State) and 65 between buildings for tuition, cultural and all Catholic Schools in that State) and 65 per cent of enrolments at non-Catholic miscellaneous, and boarding purposes. per cent of enrolments at non-Catholic schools. A further small number of returns from the latter group was received after tbe tables had been compiled; these returns represent a further 9 per cent of nonCatholic school enrolments. The data presented in the attached tables indicates the cost of achieving, for the period 1971 to 1975, what the non-government schools see as desirable levels of expenditure on capital items and on salaries, the major item of recurrent expenditure. The tables also show the financial resources which the school authorities estimate would be available to them and hence the expected shortfall between funds and resources. To assist them in providing material on a comparable basis schools were asked to estimate their income on the assumption that tees and assistance from governments remained at the 1970 levels. As a means of assessing the major recurrent needs of non-government schools, the questionnaire sought details of of salary costs and funds available to meet these costs. Details of other recurrent needs were also invited but this informawas not provided in sufficient returns to permit meaningful tables to be comDetails of capital needs were sought under the following headings: New Buildings-o n a site not previously used for the same educational purpose e.g. a new school on a new site. Replacement Buildings-o n a site previously occupied by (a) outmoded or (b) temporary buildings, used for the same educational purpose, e.g. a new primary school to replace an old one. Upgrading-t o increase the efficiency of existing educational buildings e.g. the removal of inner walls to allow for greater flexibility in teaching. Additions-ne w constructions (other than replacements) of additional were buildings in an area already occupied by a school e.g. the building of an assembly hall where none existed before. Proposed capital expenditure under each for of these headings was further divided between buildings for tuition, cultural and miscellaneous, and boarding purposes. The non-Catholic independent schools provided 196 returns covering 56 per cent of their primary enrolment and 69 per cent of their secondary enrolments. The returns were reasonably representative in their coverage of different types of schools e.g. country and city, primary and secondary, large and small, well established and recent. The Catholic schools' returns for two States did not provide all of the information requested-th e principal deficiency was information on the availability of funds, especially on the capital side. For purposes of aggregation into Australia-wide totals, the Department made estimates of funds available in these two States based on the relation between available funds and total needs in Catholic schools in the other States.

In accordance with the understanding when answers to the questionnaire were prepared, information in respect of individual schools is being treated as confidential. The following table gives an indication of the overall position of the non-government school during the period 1971 to 1975 within the terms of reference chosen by the Australian Education Council for the Nation-wide Survey of Educational Needs.

Centralian Teachers' Association (N.T.). Two associations sent an interim submission and undertook to supply further material at a later date. The material already in hand is wide Tanging and contains valuable suggestions on future educational arrangements. These will be taken into account in future educational planning in the Territories and, to this end, every opportunity will be offered the above mentioned organisations to develop their views in consultation with the Department. NATION-WIDE SURVEY OF EDUCATIONAL NEEDS A SURVEY, CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE, OF THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY AND THE NORTHERN TERRITORY Introduction At a meeting in March 1969 of the Australian Educational Council which comprises the six State Ministers of Education, education suited to modern education prises the six State Ministers of Education, it was decided that each State should conduct a survey, according to common terms of reference, of what its educational needs would be in the 5 years 1970 to 1974. The period to be covered by the survey was later changed to cover 1971 to 1975. Because of its responsibility for education in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth has co-operated with the States by conducting an investigation of the needs in these Territories. Except where specified otherwise, the survey is concerned only with Government schools. The terms of reference adopted by the Australian Education Council and consequently used in the survey of the educational needs of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are: 'In respect of all levels of education up to the completion of secondary schooling and in respect of teacher education, the surveys will: (1) Examine the needs of the State/ Territory in such matters as: (a) the administrative structure, organisation and establishment required to achieve informed, progressive and efficient administration; (b) acquisition of land for the establishment of educational facilities, the development of appropriate building designs, the erection of new school buildings and the improvement of existing ones; (c) equipment and supplies; (d) the recruitment and supply of teachers and professional supporting staff; (e) the pre-service and in-service education of teachers; (f) the provision of ancillary staff; (g) scholarships, allowances and bursaries. (2) Determine priorities for the fulfilment of these needs. (3) Establish a program to meet these priorities. (4) Provide estimates of the costs involved. The surveys will have regard to standards of provision reuired for high quality education suited to modern education systems'. In making an assessment of needs some twelve areas of investigation were determined. These headings are: 1. Administrative Structure 2. Teaching Staff 3. Ancillary Staff 4. Buildings 5. Land 6. Equipment 7. Pre-service Education of Teachers 8. In-service Education 9. Scholarships 10. Provision of Textbooks 11. Transport 12. Assistance to Non-Government Schools. All estimates of costs were based upon the 1968-1969 expenditure. Allowance was made for a 5 per cent per annum increase in salaries and general recurrent costs in the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory and for a 3 per cent per annum increase in building costs in the Australian Capita] Territory and 4 per cent per annum in the Northern Territory. The December 1969 national wage decision of a 3 per cent increase was also taken into consideration when estimating the various costs.

ADMINISTRATION Primary and secondary education in government schools is administered jointly by the Commonwealth Department of Education and Science and the New South Wales Department of Education. The Commonwealth Department is responsible for general policy and it provides, furnishes, equips and maintains buildings and co-ordinates general educational services, while the New South Wales Department of Education administers staff, curriculum and professional services, the cost of these being reimbursed by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth's responsibilities in the administration of education in the Australian Capital Territory ' are shared between the Territorial Education Branch and the General Educational Facilities Branch both of which lie in the Educational Facilities and Territorial Education Division of the Department nf Education and Science. Salaries of administrative staff, reduced proportionately for those officers having responsibilities beyond the Australian CapiTerritory schools system, amounted to SCHOOLS $65,000 in 1968-69. Incidental administrative expenditure amounted to $22,000, making a total administrative cost of $87,000. Administration of teaching is carried out 1974 1975 through School Principals and Inspector* who report to the New South Wales Department of Education. This Department also maintains an Education Clinic 1975 and provides school counselling services 25,610 which are co-ordinated through a District Guidance Officer. Reimbursement to the New South Wales Authority for salaries of inspectors and guidance staff and their clerical supporting staff totalled approximately $62,000 in 1968-69. In addition, a 5,400 payment is made to the New South Wales 12.500 Department for administrative overhead (including supply of basic expendable supplies to Australian Capital Territory schools, equal to 5 per cent of all salaries paid by that Department). This payment amounted to approximately $205,000 in 1968-69. It is expected that present administrative the 5 year period.

STAFFING: Teachers: The New South Wales Department of Education provides teachers for Australian Capital Territory primary and secondary schools on the same basis as for New South Wales schools. In 1968 the number of full-time (and equivalent full-time) teachers in primary schools was 461 and the number of pupils was 13,946, the ngures for secondary schools were 399 teachers and 6,640 pupils, giving teacher-pupil ratios of: Primary 1:30 Secondary 1:17 In 1968, of a total of 416 primary classes123 had 30 or fewer pupils 170 had between 31 and 35 pupils 95 had between 36 and 40 pupils 28 had between 40 and 45 pupils. and of a total of 220 secondary English classes61 had 25 or fewer pupils 39 had between 26 and 30 pupils 50 had between 31 and 35 pupils 66 had between 36 and 40 pupils 4 had between 41 and 45 pupils.

A 3 year plan is at present in operation in New South Wales schools to provide ancillary staff as follows: Secondary Schools: (Maximum Enrolment 1,100) One Typist, 2 Clerical Assistants One Science Attendant One Library Assistant One Cookery Maid Primary Schools: One full-time position in schools with enrolment above 600 in the primary department. One part-time position (15 hours per week) for schools with enrolment below 600 in the primary department. One Teachers' Aide for schools with more than 5 kindergarten classes, and One part-time Aide for schools with more than 2 kindergarten classes. Special Schools: One Aide to 3 class teachers or 2 Aides to 5 teachers. Some of these provisions have already been implemented in the Australian Capital Territory. The additional costs involved in bringing the Australian Capital Territory into line with the New South Wales proposals would be for Teachers' Aides in Infants and Special schools, the additional cost of which would be $20,000 for 1970. Estimated costs of ancillary services for 1971-75 including these new proposals are: Year 1971 . . 1972 1973 1974 1975 Total .. .. .. 4. BUILDING STANDARDS The National Capital Development Commission is the design and construction authority for all Departmental educational buildings erected in Canberra. In some other parts of the Australian Capital Territory construction and design work is performed by the Department of Works. The Department of Education and Science informs the Commission and the Department of Works of its specific building requirements assessed on the basis of educational needs. These requirements are under continuous review by Committees established for the purpose of ensuring that the accommodation meets educational needs and that the layouts of teaching and other spaces are functional while at the same time endeavouring to obtain the best value for money to be spent on the buildings, services and grounds. There are 47 schools in the Australian Capital Territory. Of these, 33 have been built since 1958. Replacement therefore will not be a significant factor during the period under review. Estimated annual costs for new buildings based on anticipated enrolment increases for the period will be: Capital Recurrent Year costs costs Tolal $'000 $'000 S'OOO 1971 3,593 1,051 4,644 1972 4,097 1,217 5,314 1973 4,328 1,399 5,727 1974 4,863 1,607 6,470 1975 4,664 1,825 6,489 Total 21,545 7,099 28,644 Payments to Estimated capital costs consist of thc New South Wales cost of building new schools and estimated for ancillary staff recurrent costs include maintenance, cleaning costs and janitors' wages.

Site development costs are included in '4' above. School sites are adjacent to neighbourhood or district recreation areas which provide additional sporting and recreational facilities. 6. PROVISION OF EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES Australian Capital Territory schools are supplied with certain consumable materials on the same basis as these are supplied on annual requisition to New South Wales schools, e.g., chalk, stationery, etc. The cost of these items is recouped by thc New South Wales Department of Education. The Commonwealth provides further supplies of selected consumable materials and in addition supplies items of nonconsumable equipment. Subsidies are also made to Parents and Citizens Associations for library books and physical education equipment. Grants to government schools for iibrary books are on the following basis: Intial Grants Primary Schools-$50 0 Secondary Schools-$1,00 0 Senior Secondary Reference Libraries The amount of $2,000 spread over two nnancial years. Subsidies 40 cents in the dollar tor all books purchased by Parents Associations. Grants to independent schools for library books are covered in Section 13.

IN-SERVICE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS All courses of in-service training for school teachers are at present arranged by the New South Wales Department of Education. Consideration is now oeing given to making in-service courses available in Canberra by utilising the resources of the Canberra College of Advanced Education. These courses could not be introduced before 1971 and it has not been possible to include any estimate of costs in this surCommonwealth secondary scholarships are available throughout Australia and have been dealt with in a later section. In thc Australian Capital Territory, ihe Minister may award bursaries to pupils entering first year at a secondary school.

STAFFING The South Australian Education Department provides teachers for Northern Territory primary and secondary schools. In 1969 there were 352 teachers in primary and secondary schools. The estimated cost ot teachers' salaries in 1969 was $1,650,640, ol which 65 per cent was for primary teachers and 35 per cent for secondary. It is anticipated that the number of teachers will increase proportionately to tration in special schools tor aboriginal children in goverament settlements, missions and pastoral properties. The Education Department of South Australia provides the teaching staff for thc schoois and the Commonwealth provides buildings, I97J 1974 1975 maintenance, transport services and school 110,100 120,000 equipment. The salaries of administration staff, reduced proportionately for tnose officers 1973 1974 1975 having responsibilities beyond tne Northern Territory primary and secondary schools, amounted to an estimated $59,900 iu 1968-69. Administration of teaching is carried out 1973 1974 1975 through heads of schools and inspectors, 1,200 300 1,300 : 300 1.500 400 1,800 400 who report to the South Australian Education Department. The Commonweallh aboriginal children attending reimburses tbe South Australian Authority for salaries of all inspectorial and teaching staff, and for other expenditure associated with the provision of teachers Cor the Northern Territory. In addition, a payment is made to the South Australian authorities to cover administrative overheads. This payment amounts to 15 per cent of reimbursements.

Of this, $139,000 was paid to the Northern Territory Administration for the use of government buses, and $45,600 to contractors. It is anticipated that the transport costs will rise in proportion to the increase in primary and secondary enrolment for government and non-government schools. The cost for each of the next five years will therefore be: Year $'000 1971 . . .. .. 255 1972 . . 300 1973 .. 352 1974 . . 415 1975 .. 490 Total 1,812 11.
