Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Hume-Ministe r,15

NA,new clause to deal with that afterwarcls.,15
NA,Clause agreed to.,15
NA,Clause 33 agreed to.,15
NA,Clause 34-,15
NA,(1) Whenever in the opinion of the Minister,15
NA,the prompt despatch of the business of a depart-,15
NA,"ment renders temporary assistance necessary, and",15
NA,the commissioner is unable to provide such assist-,15
NA,ance from other departments in the State in,15
NA,"which such assistance is.required, the permanent",15
NA,"headorthechief officer shall, select from the persons",15
NA,whose names are upon the prescribedregister in,15
NA,"the State, in which such assistance is required,",15
NA,such person or persons who are available as appear,15
NA,to be best qualified for such work.,15
NA,(2) Such person or persons may be employed,15
NA,to perform such -work for any period not exceed-,15
NA,ing six months.,15
NA,(3) No person who has been temporarily em-,15
NA,ployed in any department for six months con-,15
NA,"tinuously, or for nine months continuously where",15
NA,"extended as hereinafter provided, or for six",15
NA,"months in the whole in any twelve months, or for",15
NA,nine months continuously where extended as,15
NA,"hereinafter provided, shall during the six months",15
NA,m following such temporary employment be eligible,15
NA,for further temporary employment in the public,15

NA,(4) I i it appears in the public interest to bc,15
NA,desirable so to do the commissioner may order,15
NA,that any person who has been temporarily em-,15

NA,tinuously may be temporarily employed for not,15
NA,"more than three additional, months, but in such",15

NA,Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE ) pro-,16
NA,posed-,16
NA,"Thafc thc words "" of a department"" be inserted",16
NA,"after the word "" Minister,"" line 1.",16
Mr TUDOR ,Yarra) -Ther e are cer-,16
NA,tain things in regard to temporary employ-,16
NA,ment whicli are not very satisfactory to the,16
NA,men. I think i t should be specified i n the,16
NA,clause that temporary employes should re-,16
NA,ceive at least the same minimum as is paid,16
NA,"to permanent officers, and a half-holiday",16
NA,per week where i t . is given as well as the,16
NA,gazetted holidays. I n some cases the tem-,16
NA,"porary emplo3 es get the gazetted holidays,",16
NA,r,16
NA,but they do not get paid for them. They,16
NA,are compelled to take the holidays and donot,16
NA,receive any pay. I think the temporary hands,16
NA,in the general division should receive the,16
NA,same consideration as the lowest paid officer,16
NA,therein.,16
NA,Amendment agreed to.,16
Mr POYNTON ,South Australia) - I,16
NA,would like the Minister for Home Affairs to,16
NA,explain the reason for sub-clause (3). I n,16
NA,South Australia there has been a consider-,16
NA,able amount of friction about men who,16
NA,have heen on the temporary list; and after,16
NA,considerable trouble there certain privileges,16
NA,were obtained for such men after they are,16
NA,employed twelve months continuously.,16
NA,Whether i t is true or otherwise i t has been,16
NA,frequently reported that in a great number of,16
NA,instances care is taken that the men shall not,16
NA,"be twelve months employed, so as to prevent",16
NA,them from being entitled to certain privileges,16
NA,which are allowed after they are employed for,16
NA,that period. Without having. any reason,16
NA,"assigned for it , i t seems a singular proceed-",16
NA,ing that a man who has been nine months i n,16
NA,temporary employment-tha t is allowing an,16
NA,"extreme case, where provision is made for an",16
NA,extension of three months-i s to be put off,16
NA,and barred from getting temporary employ-,16
NA,ment for a' considerable time afterwards. I,16
NA,would ask the Minister to explain the,16
NA,reason for this provision i n the clause.,16
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,"Th e principal,",16
NA,reason is that in some of the States a system,16
NA,has grown up under wliich temporary em-,16
NA,ployment has amounted almost to permanent,16
NA,employment. I n New South Wales we,16
NA,have had men temporarily employed for,16
NA,between 20 and 30 years. That is a most,16
NA,"unsatisfactory state of things, and one",16
NA,object of this provision is to prevent such a,16
NA,state of things occurring under the Bill.,16
NA,"Another reason for the provision is that ""one",16
NA,person shall not be continuously appointed,16
NA,temporarily. I f the work is required to be,16
NA,done; let that man or another man be,16
NA,appointed permanently. ' The temporary,16
NA,employment is to be availed of only i n the,16
NA,case of a rush of work which will be of a,16
NA,"temporary character, and not to get on a",16
NA,number of men as temporary hands for an,16
NA,"indefinite term. Besides that, i t gives an",16
NA,opportunity to bring into the service persons,16
NA,who do not pass through tlie ordinary,16
NA,"classification and examination, and who may",16
NA,take the place of the permanent hands who,16
NA,should be employed. I think the honorable,16
NA,member will see that we have had an ex-,16
NA,perience i n this matter wliich is not satisfac-,16
NA,tory and which should be stopped.,16
Mr MAUGER ,Melbourne Ports) - I,16
NA,would like to emphasize what the honorable,16
NA,"member for Yarra has pointed out, and to",16
NA,get an assurance from the Minister as to,16
NA,what he proposes to do i n regard to the,16
NA,appointment of temporary hands. What the,16
NA,"honorable member for Yarra said is notorious,",16
NA,but i t is also notorious that tliose persons -who,16
NA,"are permanently temporary hands, i f I may",16
NA,"so put it, are paid considerably less than the",16
NA,officers who are working i n a regular way.,16
NA,Surely that is not fair either to the men or to,16
NA,the public. I would urge that the Minister,16
NA,should give an assurance that tlie Govern-,16
NA,ment intend to protect tenrporary employes,16
NA,by seeing that when they are doing like,16
NA,work with permanent employes they sliall,16
NA,be paid the same rate of remunera-,16
NA,tion - I quite agree with the honorable,16
NA,"gentleman as to the need for the clause, and",16
NA,".shall support it, but I think the committee",16
NA,should receive an assurance as to how tem-,16
NA,porary employes are to be treated.,16
Mr MCCAY ,Corinella) - I would suggest,16
NA,to the Minister what might possibly be a,16
NA,flaw i n the working of tlie clause. I t says-,16
NA,-The permanent head or the chief officer shall',16
NA,select from the persons whose names are upon the-,16
NA,prescribed register iu the State in which such as-,17
NA,sistance is required such person or persons who,17
NA,are available as appear to be best qualified for,17
NA,such work.,17
NA,AAould i t not be wise to insert words allow-,17
NA,r,17
NA,ing the making of regulations to control,17
NA,this selection a little more ? I n Victoria we,17
NA,have had a great deal of trouble in regard to,17
NA,"temporary lists, and i t would be as well to",17
NA,select from the persons whose names are on,17
NA,the prescribed register in such a manner as,17
NA,"may be prescribed, so as to prevent men",17
NA,from being taken from the bottom of the,17
NA,list to the exclusion of those who have been,17
NA,"much longer registered, and who are much",17
NA,higher on the list. I n Victoria we have,17
NA,followed the practice of taking the first,17
NA,"suitable man on the list, i n order to give",17
NA,everybody a turn. Having had his turn that,17
NA,"man goes down, and he has to re-register,",17
NA,so that those low on the list get their,17
NA,turn i f suitable for the work. I t would do,17
NA,no harm to allow this matter to be settled,17
NA,"by regulation to a certain extent, because",17
NA,as the clause stands there is absolutely no,17
NA,check to the selection by the permanent,17
NA,head.,17
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , H o w can we,17
NA,avoid that?,17
Mr MCCAY , I would suggest tliat,17
NA,"the word ""select,"" i n line 7, the words",17
NA,""" i n such manner as may be prescribed""",17
NA,be inserted. I see the permanent,17
NA,"is here again, and I do not know whether",17
NA,any objection is raised to that by the,17
NA,"honorable member for Wentworth, i n so",17
NA,pursuance of his crusade in favour of,17
NA,commissioner. I have been recently getting,17
NA,the impression that that honorable member,17
NA,is not following his maxim so much as he,17
NA,following the maxim of the county fair-,17
NA,"wherever you see a permanent head, h",17
NA,"him. I n this case, however, i t is difficult",17
NA,to make the commissioner select men for,17
NA,"temporary work, and though I am not quite",17
NA,"sure this is the proper place, I move-",17
NA,"That after thc word ""select,"" in line 7, the",17
NA,"words "" i n such manner as may be prescribed",17
NA,bc inserted.,17
Mr BATCHELOR ,South Australia) -,17
NA,"I t seems to me there vvould be difficulty,",17
NA,"some of the States at any rate, where men",17
NA,have been temporarily employed for a,17
NA,siderable number of years.,17
NA,"have served six months, the)' will certainly",17
NA,"have to ""get"" from tlie Commonwealth",17
NA,service as the result of this clause.,17
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , T h i s clause,17
NA,refers to the Commonwealth only.,17
Mr BATCHELOR ,O f course; but I,17
NA,am talking about men who have been pre-,17
NA,"viously i n tlie service of the States, but now '",17
NA,are temporarily employed i n the service of,17
NA,the Commonwealth. I f these men are not,17
NA,"taken over as permanent hands, they will",17
NA,all be dismissed after they have had six,17
NA,"months' service, and that means a serious",17
NA,tiling i n some of the States. So far as,17
NA,"South Australia is concerned, there will not",17
NA,"be any trouble, because the practice is that",17
NA,when a man has been' twelve months tem-,17
NA,"porarily employed, he is regarded as a",17
NA,"permanent hand, and has all the rights and",17
NA,privileges of a permanent hand. I under-',17
NA,"stand tliat i n Victoria, however, there are a",17
NA,considerable number of men temporarily,17
NA,"employed, and these will necessarily have to",17
NA,be dismissed. I understand from an honor-,17
NA,able member that that is the practice i n,17
NA,New South Wales to a still greatei extent,17
NA,1,17
NA,"than i n Victoria, and I should hke to hear",17
NA,what the Minister's ideas are as to the whole-,17
NA,sale sacking of tliose men.,17
Mr POYNTON ,South Australia) - I,17
NA,"thoroughly agree ""with the Minister that i t",17
NA,is a laudable object to prevent temporary,17
NA,"employment, under the conditions to which",17
NA,"after he refers,' but I am afraid this clause",17
NA,does not prevent i t . The clause merely,17
NA,provides that a certain class of men shall,17
NA,"head be employed at the most for nine months, but",17
NA,that another set of men can then be taken,17
NA,"on. There is no provision in the Bill at all,",17
NA,"far as I understand, that where tliere are",17
NA,the reasonable grounds men ought to be per-,17
NA,manently employed. There ought to be a,17
NA,sub-clause making i t clear that when tem-,17
NA,is porary employment becomes abnormal there,17
NA,should be a drafting from the temporary,17
NA,i t class into the permanent class so as to,17
NA,prevent the possibility of men being,17
NA,employed temporarily for five or ten years.,17
NA,Under the clause i t is quite clear no man,17
NA,can be employed continuously for more than,17
NA,"nine months, and then there must be a six",17
NA,""" months' break i n his employment ; but in",17
NA,that six months a number' of other men can,17
NA,"be temporarily employed, and the first set",17
NA,"in of men become again eligible, and so on.",17
Mr BATCHELOR ,Fo r years.,17
con- - Mr POYNTON ,Thi s clause seems to,17
NA,After the men be very defective from the point of view of,17
NA,"the Minister, who wishes to prevent the",17
NA,continuation of temporary employment.,17
NA,W i l l the Minister consider the desirable-,17
NA,"ness of attaching a sub-clause, making i t",17
NA,possible to draft from the temporary list,17
NA,"into the permanent list, as an instruction to",18
NA,"officers to prevent temporary emploj'ment,",18
NA,-whether by one or two sets of men? The,18
NA,effect is the same whether we have tempor-,18
NA,"ary men for 20 years or for one year, i f we",18
NA,have two sets of men to work on.,18
Mr MCLEAN ,Gippsland) -Ther e is,18
NA,a difficulty in doing what the honorable,18
NA,"member for South Australia, Mr Poynton,",18
NA,suggests. Every one sees the desirability,18
NA,of carrying out his object as far as practic-,18
NA,"able, but there is the difficulty that there",18
NA,are certain kinds of work which are con-,18
NA,tinuously expanding aud contracting. There,18
NA,may be a rush of traffic in the grain season,18
NA,"causing a great deal of extra work, or there",18
NA,may be extensive railway' construction,18
NA,going on. Different branches of the Rail-,18
NA,way department are continuously expanding,18
NA,ancl contracting according to the amount,18
NA,"of the pa rticular kind of work i h hand, and",18
NA,therefore we cannot very well have a perma-,18
NA,nent staff. This is the kind of work generally,18
NA,"kept for temporary hands, and i t is intended",18
NA,as far as possible for those out of employ-,18
NA,ment - That intention may be abused to a,18
NA,"considerable extent, but tliat is the object.",18
NA,"The honorable member for South Australia,",18
NA,"Mr Poynton, will see the difficulty of making",18
NA,the work permanent for the reason tliat we,18
NA,"do not know the number of hands required,",18
NA,three or four times as many men being,18
NA,necessary at one time than at another.,18
Mr POYNTON ,Tak e for instance the,18
NA,"repairers in the Telegraph department, who",18
NA,are kept on for years.,18
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ,Went-,18
NA,worth) -I t would be better if my facetious,18
NA,"friend opposite, the honorable and learned",18
NA,"member for Corinella, would point out where,",18
NA,"in going through the Bill, we have acted i n",18
NA,the silly fashion of hitting the permanent,18
NA,head on tlie head when i t was unnecessary.,18
NA,I do not think any alteration has been made,18
NA,that is not absolutely i n consonance with the.,18
NA,arrangements up to the present time.,18
Mr MCCAY , I was purely facetious.,18
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , I quite,18
NA,agree that in this clause i t is very question-,18
NA,able whether we ought not to retain the,18
NA,permanent head as the person connected with,18
NA,"temporary employment, seeing that further on",18
NA,the commissioner comes in so that there can,18
NA,be no damage done to the public service.,18
NA,But as regards the proposal of the honorable,18
NA,"and learned member for Corinella, i t would",18
NA,be very dangerous to introduce i t here. The,18
NA,arguments we apphed last night i n another,18
NA,case hold good here. I t is impossible i n the,18
NA,"wide area of this Commonwealth, and with",18
NA,"the diversity of officers and work, to pin any",18
NA,permanent head down to the selection of,18
NA,men. The man next on the list might be a,18
NA,person utterly unfit for the service required.,18
Mr MCCAY , I do not suggest that.,18
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , I f I,18
NA,understand thehonorableand learned member,18
NA,"aright, he wants to take the register or",18
NA,"whatever i t may be, and give the next man",18
NA,temporary employment.,18
Mr MCCAY ,Corinella) - I do not say,18
NA,t h a t; I say the clause as i t stands permits,18
NA,the permanent head to select a suitable man,18
NA,"from anywhere on the list, whereas i n such",18
NA,"registers ordinarily, i t is considered a reason-",18
NA,able thing to take suitable men in tlieir,18
NA,"order as they appear on the list, if they are",18
NA,available in the locality. I do not even,18
NA,"determine the form of tlie regulation, but",18
NA,simply say there ought to be power given to,18
NA,make regulations in order that suitable men,18
NA,may get a fair chance in turn.,18
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , I think the,18
NA,"amendment is practically surplusage, be-",18
NA,cause we must take tlie officers who will act,18
NA,under this clause to be persons of common,18
NA,sense.,18
Mr FOWLER ,Perth) - I must also,18
NA,take exception to the clause as i t stands at,18
NA,present. I t seems to me the clause will,18
NA,militate very seriously against the effi-,18
NA,"hne ciency of the service, i f the principle be",18
NA,admitted of dismissing temporary hands,18
NA,after they have been a certain time at work.,18
NA,I f work requires to be continued i t is,18
NA,reasonable to assume that the man who has,18
NA,been employed on i t is the best man to be,18
NA,continued on it. To change him for a fresh,18
NA,"man would, to my mind, from a business",18
NA,"point of view, be detrimental to the interests",18
NA,bf tlie service.,18
Mr THOMSON ,Ther e is provision in the,18
NA,next clause for that.,18
Mr MCCOLL ,Echuca) - I hope the,18
NA,clause will remain as i t is. I f any altera-,18
NA,"tion is to be made, the period during which",18
NA,a temporary hand should remain out of,18
NA,employment ought to be extended. I f the,18
NA,views of the honorable member for South,18
NA,"Australia, Mr Poynton, were adopted, i t",18
NA,would simply bring about the old state of,18
NA,affairs we have had i n Victoria. I n Vic-,18
NA,"toria a large number of men have, got into",18
NA,"the service not through the door, but over",18
NA,the wall. We had at one time an enormous,18
NA,"service, and had to take very drastic means",18
NA,fco reduce ifc. We must be very careful with,19
NA,"regard to temporary employment, which",19
NA,"ought to be very sparingly used, and only",19
NA,"when absolutely required, because once a",19
NA,man gets into a department i t is very hard,19
NA,to get him oufc. Men have their friends i n,19
NA,"departmental officials, who so contrive to",19
NA,use every loophole i n the Act that these,19
NA,temporal*}' men become permanent before,19
NA,"we know where we are. I would, however,",19
NA,ask the Minister to look at the three,19
NA,"last lines of the clause on page 13, which I",19
NA,suggest are unnecessary. Those lines pro-,19
NA,"vide that, where a man has been employed",19
NA,"for six months, and has that period extended",19
NA,"another three months, the statement of",19
NA,"such extension, and the reasons therefor, shall,",19
NA,"as soon as practicable, be laid before Parlia-",19
NA,ment. Is i t necessary that such a small,19
NA,matter should occupy the time of clerks in,19
NA,making out a precise statement as to why,19
NA,the extension is made'?,19
Mr BATCHELOR ,South Australia) -,19
NA,I quite agree with the honorable member for,19
NA,Echuca that a great deal of danger is likely,19
NA,to arise if we are not very careful i n this,19
NA,matter of temporary employment. We do,19
NA,not want the converting of temporary hands,19
NA,into permanent hands to be made a means of,19
NA,persons getting into the service i n any other,19
NA,way than by the ordinary examination. I f,19
NA,"that be allowed, more harm than good will",19
NA,"be clone. A t the same time, there is a great",19
NA,deal in the contention of the honorable,19
NA,"member for South Australia, Mr Poynton,",19
NA,that temporary employment may be extended,19
NA,"a great deal longer than tlie time named, on",19
NA,"the score of economy. Ifc is much cheaper,",19
NA,"at times, to employ temporary hands than",19
NA,"permanent hands, the latter of whom re-",19
NA,ceive certain holidays and other privileges.,19
NA,The practice of employing temporary hands is,19
NA,"constantly adopted in the States, and is veiy",19
NA,likely to be adopted in' the Commonwealth,19
NA,service. Temporary employment should be,19
NA,confined as nearly as possible to works of a,19
NA,temporary character. There is a lot of work,19
NA,in connexion withfcheCommonwealth service,19
NA,"which will be going on year after year,",19
NA,and which should properly be done by per-,19
NA,manent employes'. Under this clause there,19
NA,will be an opportunity to take men on,19
NA,"for six months, and in special circumstances",19
NA,"for an additional three months, at the end",19
NA,"of which time they may be dismissed, and",19
NA,another set of men taken on in thenplace.,19
NA,"This operation may be repeated indefinitely,",19
NA,"thus defeating the object of the Bill,",19
NA,which is that the conditions under,19
NA,which all persons employed on per-,19
NA,manent works for the Commonwealth,19
NA,should be laid down. I know that i n,19
NA,connexion with the railway service of South,19
NA,Australia men are taken on for twelve,19
NA,"months all but a day or two, and then are dis-",19
NA,missed i n order that they may not get the,19
NA,holidays to which permanent employes are,19
NA,entitled. That is a dodge to escape the,19
NA,necessity for having proper conditions i n,19
NA,the public service. I tliink i t would be,19
NA,"well if we could define "" temporary employ-",19
NA,"ment "" i n some way. A t present I confess",19
NA,that I do not like the clause.,19
Mr THOMSON ,North Sydney) -,19
NA,W i t h reference to the remarks of the last,19
NA,"speaker, I would point out that these pro-",19
NA,visions tend to effect what he desires.,19
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,The y are more,19
NA,stringent than those i n any of the State,19
NA,Acts.,19
Mr THOMSON ,Excep t the New South,19
NA,Wales Act.,19
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,The y are more,19
NA,stringent than the New South Wales Act.,19
Mr THOMSON , I am nofc familiar with,19
NA,the language of the New South Wales Act.,19
NA,But i t seems to me that i f the heads of de-,19
NA,partments can keep on temporary men as,19
NA,"long as they choose, then they are very",19
NA,unlikely to make them permanent men. But,19
NA,"if, on the other hand, they could keep tem-",19
NA,"porary men for a period of only^ six months,",19
NA,"or under special conditions for nine months,",19
NA,and if the work is of sucli a constant,19
NA,character thafc they really require permanent,19
NA,"men, ifc will be far more to their advantage",19
NA,to get permanent men than to be constantly,19
NA,changing temporary hands. Under these,19
NA,conditions I think that tlie clause will work,19
NA,favorably to the views of the honorable,19
NA,"member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor.",19
NA,From the experience of one of the States,19
NA,there is no doubt thafc this temporary em-,19
NA,"ployment, if i t is nofc made actually tempo-",19
NA,rary by some provision- -,19
Mr BATCHELOR,"I "" do not object to fchafc",19
NA,at all.,19
Mr THOMSON , I am quite aware of,19
NA,that. I was about to say that i f this,19
NA,temporary employment is not made actually,19
NA,temporary by some provision we shall get into,19
NA,the public service a lot of unnecessary men,19
NA,"who will be kept there by influence, because",19
NA,the permanent head of a department has the,19
NA,appointment of the temporary hands and is,19
NA,subject to his Minister. I n another State,19
NA,that system has resulted i n a number of,20
NA,men being kept employed who were not,20
NA,"really required, and the service has there-",20
NA,fore been swelled unduly. The fact that,20
NA,meu cannot be kept permanently employed,20
NA,on what are really temporary works will,20
NA,induce tlie permanent heads to make perma-,20
NA,nent appointments where there is need for,20
NA,tliem rather than lose at the end of six or nine,20
NA,months the men who have been accustomed,20
NA,to the work. I would draw the attention,20
NA,of the Minister for Home Affairs to the,20
NA,need for a verbal alteration in sub-clause (3).,20
NA,"I t seems to me that the words "" f o r nine",20
NA,months continuously where extended as,20
NA,"hereinafter provided "" in the secpnd place'in",20
NA,which they are used are unnecessary and,20
NA,should be omitted.,20
Mr MCCOLL ,Echuca) -I t is unfor-,20
NA,tunate that i n the drafting of tliis clause,20
NA,the section of the old Civil Service A ct of,20
NA,Victoria of 1890 has been adopted instead of,20
NA,the newer one of last December. The section,20
NA,which has been introduced into this Bill gave,20
NA,"rise to a good deal of trouble, and was found",20
NA,"to work very unsatisfactorily. There""' is",20
NA,now an entirely new section which will be,20
NA,found i n A ct No. 1721 of the Victorian,20
NA,Acts. I t is dated only last December and,20
NA,brings this legislation right up to date. I,20
NA,"would ask the Minister for Home Affairs,",20
NA,"before the B i ll finally passes, to look at the",20
NA,"later section of the Victorian Act, which",20
NA,deals with a number of points that are,20
NA,"contained in'tliis Bill, and to see i f he cannot",20
NA,adopt some of the provisions of that newer,20
NA,"section, i n preference to those i n this clause.",20
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I w i l l look into i t .,20
Mr POYNTON ,South Australia) - I,20
NA,am not at all. satisfied with this clause. A t,20
NA,a later part i n the Bill provision is made,20
NA,for certain holidays for the civil service.,20
NA,That provision will be one means by which,20
NA,a lot of men may be kept i n temporary em-,20
NA,ployment. I do not care whether i t is,20
NA,provided in regard to two classes ; the effect,20
NA,is just the same. Thereisnothinginthisclause,20
NA,to prevent temporary employment being,20
NA,continued for a considerable time more than,20
NA,is necessary. The very reason why men,20
NA,have been kept on temporarily in many of the,20
NA,States was because they were not entitled,20
NA,to some of the privileges wliich are con-,20
NA,ferred upon tlie fixed list.,20
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,- I have introduced,20
NA,this most drastic proposal with a view to,20
NA,meeting the objection of the honorable,20
NA,member.,20
Mr POYNTON , I have been waiting,20
NA,for the Minister to assure us tliat he would,20
NA,consider the point which I have raised. I,20
NA,am not raising i t out of any spirit of,20
NA,captious opposition. The object of the,20
NA,clause is to prevent temporary emplo3 ment,20
NA,7,20
NA,being continued. But I am afraid that,20
NA,i t will only prevent the continuance i n,20
NA,temporary employment of one class of men,20
NA,whilst i t will permit the evil in regard to,20
NA,another class.,20
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Hume-Minis -,20
NA,ter for Home Affairs) - I am perfectly,20
NA,aware tliat the honorable member for,20
NA,"South Australia, Mr Poynton, is not",20
NA,raising this question from any spirit,20
NA,of captious opposition. I admit that,20
NA,some very good suggestions emanated,20
NA,from him last night. But I would point,20
NA,"out that, the clause is more drastic as re-",20
NA,gards the question of temporary employ-,20
NA,ment than are the provisions in any State,20
NA,"Act. I t is a difficult question I admit, and",20
NA,I cannot see how we can go much further,20
NA,than we have gone in this clause. We,20
NA,have provided that a man cannot be tem-,20
NA,porarily employed for more than nine,20
NA,"months, and that some good reason must",20
NA,be given for thus .employing him for more,20
NA,than six months. After the expiration,20
NA,of nine months he cannot be employed,20
NA,again for a further term of six months.,20
NA,Surely the honorable member would not,20
NA,"prevent a good, man who has been employed",20
NA,temporarily from being again similarly em-,20
NA,ployed. The question is what period,20
NA,should elapse before he is eligible for such,20
NA,further employment. I quite recognise the,20
NA,difficulty to which the honorable member,20
NA,"has alluded, but I would point out that we",20
NA,must leave something to the discretion of,20
NA,the permanent head and the Minister. In,20
NA,- a case such as the honorable member has,20
NA,suggested we should have questions in,20
NA,Parliament find probably action taken i n,20
NA,Parliament to preventthe continuance of tem-,20
NA,porary employment. I have done the best,20
NA,that is possible to meet an admitted trouble.,20
NA,1 must say that the provisions of the clause,20
NA,"ore open to abuse, and I shall be",20
NA,quite prepared to accept '/my suggestion,20
NA,which will make such an abuse more diffi-,20
NA,cult without preventing a man who has,20
NA,been temporarily employed from being,20
NA,"employed again. As to the payment, I",20
NA,think that there should be some regulation.,20
NA,I think that a regulation might be framed,20
NA,providing that where temporary hands are,20
NA,employed tliey shall receive the same pay-,21
NA,ment as those who are permanently em-,21
NA,ployed to perform thesame .work.,21
Mr TTJDOR ,- X have an amendment to,21
NA,that effect.,21
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I shall be quite,21
NA,prepared to accept any fair amendment.,21
NA,Some honorable member refened to the,21
NA,raihvay service. I merely wish to say tliat,21
NA,i n the railway service in New South Wales,21
NA,-at one time permanent men were removed,21
NA,and temporary men given employment at a,21
NA,lower rate of wage.,21
Mr MAUGER ,"Hear , hear.",21
NA,put on where permanent men could be put,21
NA,"-on, and kept on.",21
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I n New South,21
NA,AVales a few years ago permanent men were,21
NA,retrenched and temporary men taken on in,21
NA,their stead at a lower rate. I fought that,21
NA,action at the time and am prepared to fight,21
NA,i t again. 1 think there is a great deal i n the,21
NA,-contention that if we employ men to do,21
NA,temporary work they should be paid the,21
NA,same wage that men permanently employed,21
NA,would be paid for doing similar work.,21
NA,Amendment agreed to.,21
Mr TUDOR ,Yarra) - I move that the,21
NA,following words be added to sub-clause (1):-,21
NA,And they shall be paid at the same rate as is,21
NA,"paid to the permanent employes for similar work,",21
NA,and shall be entitled to the same holidays.,21
NA,Of course the holidays will not include the,21
NA,annual leave which civil servants obtain.,21
NA,These temporary hands will be i n the em-,21
NA,ploy of u department for only six months at a,21
NA,"time, and men have to be employed for",21
NA,twelve months before they can obtain annual,21
NA,leave. They will include only the weekly,21
NA,half-holiday.,21
NA,Amendment agreed to.,21
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Th e honorable,21
NA,member for North Sydney made the sugges-,21
NA,"tion that the words-""o r for nine months",21
NA,-continuously where extended as hereinafter,21
NA,"provided "" were surplusage. They do look to",21
NA,"be unnecessary, but I do not care to strike out",21
NA,the words before I know what the effect of,21
NA,their omission would be. I f the honorable,21
NA,member will allow tlie matter to remain i n,21
NA,"abeyance for the present, I will have i t in-",21
NA,"quired into, and i f I find that the words are",21
NA,unnecessary I will have them struck out,21
NA,before we have finished wifch the Bill.,21
Mr TUDOR ,Yarra) - I would like some,21
NA,-expression of opinion from the Minister i n,21
NA,charge of the Bill as to the way in which,21
NA,[110],21
NA,the provisions of the measure will affect fche,21
NA,rights of men who have been for some time,21
NA,temporarily employed i n the State services.,21
NA,I kuow there are a large number of cases i n,21
NA,"Victoria, and probably more i n New South",21
NA,"Wales, and I would like to know i f these",21
NA,men would have to be dispensed with within,21
NA,six months of the passing of this Bill.,21
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I have just,21
NA,made some inquiry as to the probable effect,21
NA,"of the provision we have been discussing,",21
NA,and I am informed that there will be no,21
NA,necessity for turning these men out of the,21
NA,They are service. They will be taken over under the,21
NA,provisions of the Commonwealth A c t i n,21
NA,the same way as permanent hands. Of,21
NA,"course, i f we do not require tliem, they",21
NA,will have to be got rid of. There will,21
NA,have to be some system of weeding out,21
NA,in connexion with the officers taken,21
NA,over. I have heard only to-day that,21
NA,there are a great many more officers propor-,21
NA,tionately i n the service of one State than i n,21
NA,"the service of the other States, and we",21
NA,shall have to find out what is the cause.,21
NA,I f our questions are not satisfactorily an-,21
NA,swered the men who are in excess of re-,21
NA,"quirements will have to be weeded out, and",21
NA,the weeding-out process will necessarily be,21
NA,commenced amongst those men who are,21
NA,"temporarily employed. I f , on the other",21
NA,"hand, however, i t should be necessaiy to in-",21
NA,"crease the staff i n any State, I think the",21
NA,men who have been temporarily employed,21
NA,"should have first consideration, and I have",21
NA,no doubt they will be considered before new,21
NA,hands are taken on.,21
Mr BATCHELOR ,AVill these men be re-,21
NA,quired to pass an examination just iii the,21
NA,same way as new hands 1,21
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I think i t,21
NA,probable that they will require to pass an,21
NA,examination i f they are eligible and i f the,21
NA,commissioner thinks they do not possess the,21
NA,necessary qualifications.,21
Mr TUDOR ,Bu t i f they have done the,21
NA,"work for years, surely that will be the best",21
NA,test?,21
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I n cases of fchafc,21
NA,sort there will be no necessity for an ex-,21
NA,amination ; the examination need not be,21
NA,passed unless i t is thought to be,21
NA,absolutely necessary. One of the clauses,21
NA,"we passed last night provides for that,",21
NA,because ifc enables us to take into considera-,21
NA,tion the nature of the work to be done.,21
Mr VL SOLOMON ,South Australia).,21
NA,-Thi s point is one which concerns the,21
NA,position of a large number of servants in the,22
NA,South Australian departments that have,22
NA,"been taken over by the Commonwealth, who",22
NA,have been for many years on what is called,22
NA,the provisional and temporary list.,22
Mr BATCHELOR ,Thos e are not the men,22
NA,who were referred to.,22
Mr VL SOLOMON ,"Yes ,",22
NA,think they were referred to more than,22
NA,any others. I n some of the depart-,22
NA,"ments in South Australia, notably i n the",22
NA,Customs and the Post-office and Telegraph,22
NA,"departments, I have known of instances",22
NA,where men have been on the pro-,22
NA,visional and temporary list for some-,22
NA,thing like twelve or fifteen years. A l -,22
NA,though I do not wish to introduce 'State,22
NA,"or provincial politics into this debate, I",22
NA,mention that this position of affairs is due,22
NA,to the fact that the State Government have,22
NA,not brought i n a Civil Service Bil l to,22
NA,perly provide for the rights of these men,22
NA,who have now been passed over to the con-,22
NA,trol of the Eederal Parliament. I would like,22
NA,to ask the Minister whether there is anything,22
NA,in the Bill that will give any reasonable,22
NA,protection to these men ? I n the Post and,22
NA,Telegraph department there are not tens,22
NA,but hundreds of men throughout the service,22
NA,whose positions have not been properly con-,22
NA,"sidered by the State Parliament, and I",22
NA,would ask' the Minister to look into,22
NA,"this particular question, so that reason-",22
NA,able consideration may be given to,22
NA,their length of service and the rights which,22
NA,"should attach to them, and which should",22
NA,have been provided for by local legislation.,22
NA,There sire many cases where great hardship,22
NA,will 'be inflicted i f these men are not,22
NA,placed on the same footing as permanent,22
NA,"hands, and I should like to see a clause put",22
NA,in which woulcl protect them against tlie,22
NA,consequence of the neglect of the local,22
NA,Legislature.,22
Mr BATCHELOR ,South Australia) -,22
NA,The honorable member for South Australia,22
NA,Mr V . L . Solomon has raised quite a new,22
NA,issue altogether. The persons we were con-,22
NA,sidering were those who were employed tem-,22
NA,"porarily for particular work, and the honor-",22
NA,"able member has raised a veiy large issue,",22
NA,if what he has called tlie provisional and,22
NA,temporary staff could be shut out of the,22
NA,provisions of this Bill.,22
Mr VL SOLOMON ,Ca n the honorable raised.,22
NA,member show me where they come i n ?,22
Mr BATCHELOR ,Th e only clause that,22
NA,bears upon their position seems,22
NA,"be clause 29, which refers to officers of a",22
NA,"temporary or casual character, but I am",22
NA,quite certain that no one could pretend that,22
NA,the provisional and temporary staff of South,22
NA,Austraha is of a temporary or casual charac-,22
NA,"ter, because their positions are undoubtedly",22
NA,permanent. The public service is divided,22
NA,"I into two sections, viz., those onthe civil",22
NA,list and those on the provisional and,22
NA,"temporary list, ancl the only difference be-",22
NA,tween the two divisions is that the servants,22
NA,in one division are entitled to a Board of,22
NA,"Inquiry, in case of dismissal. There is not",22
NA,very much else to distinguish them except,22
NA,perhaps that tlie salaries of tliose on the,22
NA,civil list increase automatically. I tliink,22
NA,tliat three-fourths of the whole of the,22
NA,may South Australian public servants are on the,22
NA,provisional and temporary list.,22
Mr VL SOLOMON ,Yes ; and the,22
NA,pro- department of which the honorable member,22
NA,was in control is the one that I was speci-,22
NA,ally alluding to.,22
Mr BATCHELOR ,Ye s ; as far as the,22
NA,"post-office is concerned, I think the greater",22
NA,number of the officers who have been talcen,22
NA,over by the Commonwealth from the South,22
NA,Australian service are on the pro. and,22
NA,"tern, list, but they are public servants",22
NA,in the fullest sense of the term because they,22
NA,"have been in the service for years, and",22
NA,scores of them were appointed before many,22
NA,of those who are on the civil list. The,22
NA,"distinction is an absurd one, and should have",22
NA,"been rectified, but the object was to",22
NA,avoid the payment of certain accruing rights,22
NA,"to compensation, and so on.",22
Mr VL SOLOMON ,Tha t is a bi t of a,22
NA,confession.,22
Mr BATCHELOR ,Does the honorable,22
NA,member refer to me 1,22
Mr VL SOLOMON ,Tha t was the-,22
NA,"object of i t , no doubt.",22
Mr BATCHELOR , I f the honorable,22
NA,member means to refer to me in the slightest,22
NA,"way, I may say that he knows perfectly",22
NA,well that during my short administration of,22
NA,"the department, there were more men put",22
NA,on the fixed list than during the terms of,22
NA,office of half-a-dozen other Ministers put.,22
NA,together.,22
Mr VL SOLOMON ,Th e honorable mem-,22
NA,ber has my sympathy i n the point he has.,22
Mr BATCHELOR ,Bu t the suggestion,22
NA,of the honorable member was that i t was,22
NA,to me to a confession on my part.,22
Mr VL SOLOMON , I did nofc mean,23
NA,"on the honorable member's part, but I was",23
NA,speaking from a Ministerial stand-point.,23
Mr BATCHELOR , I accept the honor-,23
NA,able member's explanation. AVe have been,23
NA,"working together i n this matter, and I am",23
NA,glad to say have been successful even be-,23
NA,yond our anticipations. I f there is the least,23
NA,danger of those who have been always con-,23
NA,sidered members of the permanent staff for,23
NA,"years, but who are labelled the pro. and tern.",23
NA,"staff, and who have been for thirteen and",23
NA,fourteen years doing precisely the same,23
NA,"work, as telegraph operators and i n other",23
NA,"capacities, as the men on the civil list, being",23
NA,"considered temporary hands, i t would be a",23
NA,very serious matter. I f there is any,23
NA,necessity for an alteration of the Bill in,23
NA,order to meet such cases I hope an amend-,23
NA,ment will be made.,23
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , N o doubt a very,23
NA,important question has been raised i n this,23
NA,matter. I was nofc aware fchafc i n South,23
NA,Australia such a large number of those who,23
NA,might be called public servants were holding,23
NA,temporary positions. There are a good,23
NA,"many i n other States, bufc that has been",23
NA,rectified to a large extent i n New South,23
NA,AVales. The point is so important that I,23
NA,hope the honorable member will be content,23
NA,to let i t rest until I make inquiries. I f,23
NA,I find that there is the slightest,23
NA,risk of our throwing out a great number,23
NA,of men who have been practically permanent,23
NA,"employes, bufc who have been classed as",23
NA,"temporary, I will have a provision put i n",23
NA,the Bill that will give them the same rights,23
NA,as if they were on the permanent staff.,23
NA,Amendment (by Mr MCCOLL) agreed to-,23
NA,"That the words, '' but in such event a statement",23
NA,of such extension of employment and the reasons,23
NA,. therefor shall us soon as practicable,23
NA,"making of such order be laid before Parliament,""",23
NA,be omitted.,23
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ,Do,23
NA,derstand that the matter which has just been,23
NA,"discussed will be attended to, and that the",23
NA,Minister in charge of the Bill will prepare a wishes.,23
NA,clause to meet the case 1,23
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I am going to make,23
NA,inquiries and see what is neceessarv.,23
Sir WILLIAMMCMILLAN , N o doubt,23
NA,- a very big question will arise as to temporary,23
NA,"employes, and very close consideration will",23
NA,have to be given to the matter i n order,23
NA,"that, whilst we are introducing a new system,",23
NA,we shall not do i t i n such a drastic and,23
NA,unfair way as to practically,23
NA,of the men who have been transferred from,23
NA,the State services to the Commonwealth.,23
NA,"Clause, as amended, agreed to.",23
Mr SALMON ," Mr Chairman, before you",23
NA,go on wifch clause 35 I wish to raise a,23
NA,point of order. Standing Order 66 says-,23
NA,While the House or a committee of the whole,23
NA,"is sitting, no member shall bring any stronger",23
NA,into any part of the Chamber appropriated to the,23
NA,members of the House.,23
NA,"I do not know, sir, whether you are aware",23
NA,"of it , but there is in that part of the cham-",23
NA,ber appropriated to the members of the,23
NA,"House a gentleman who is not entitled, i n",23
NA,"my opinion, to occupy a seat on the floor. I",23
NA,ask your ruling as to whether his presence,23
NA,here is to be permitted.,23
Sir PHILIP FYSH ,Wher e is he 1,23
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,I t has been,23
NA,the custom i n New South AVales for a,23
NA,Minister always to have his under-secretary,23
NA,or his chief clerk or the draftsman i n,23
NA,such close proximity that he can be com-,23
NA,municated with on a Bill of this kind. I,23
NA,"consulted Mr Speaker, and he placed the",23
NA,gentleman where he is.,23
Mr SALMON ," I submit, sir, thafc that is",23
NA,not satisfactory. I wish to know whether,23
NA,the Speaker has power to break the stand-,23
NA,"ing order. I should like to have your ruling,",23
NA,sir.,23
The CHAIRMAN , A s my attention has,23
NA,been called to the factfchafca stranger is i n,23
NA,"the Chamber, I am compelled, by Standing",23
NA,"Order 65, to put the question whether",23

NA,The Speaker only shall have the privilege of,24
NA,admitting strangers into the portion of the cham-,24

NA,I have not that privilege.,24
Mr ISAACS ,"I f you, sir, will read the",24
NA,Continuation of that rule you will see that i t,24

NA,Senators shall have the privilege of admission,24
NA,there without orders.,24
The CHAIRMAN , I recognise the,24
NA,Difficulty which has .arisen. The practice i n,24
NA,other Chambers has been quite different,24
NA,from the practice here.,24
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,N o difference at all.,24
Mr THOMSON ,The y are never allowed,24

The CHAIRMAN , I have no option,24

Mr CHANTER ,Deniliquin) -.Durin g,24
NA,"the course of the proceedings i n committee,",24
NA,"sir, my attention was called by an honorable",24
NA,member to the fact that a stranger was pre-,24
NA,sent on the floor of the chamber. I was,24
NA,"asked to give a ruling, and i n accordance",24
NA,"-with tlie standing order, I ruled that Tliad",24
NA,no option but to order the stranger to,24
NA,"withdraw, and thereupon, i n order to get",24
NA,"your ruling on the point, the committee",24
NA,have reported progress.,24
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Hume-Ministe r,24
NA,for Home Affairs) -I t is within your,24
NA,"knowledge, sir, that I made certain repre-",24
NA,sentations to you that i t was convenient-,24
NA,and i t is done in the States-t o have my,24
NA,Stand- secretary or the draftsman i n connexion,24
NA,with the Bill so that I could communicate,24
NA,with him for the purpose of drafting,24
NA,amendments and making them i n con-,24
NA,"sonance with other parts of the Bill,",24
NA,nearer to me than he is when he is sitting,24
NA,at the extremity of the chaniber below,24
NA,"the bar. After consultation with yourself,",24
NA,"sir, you gave a certain instruction this morn-",24
NA,"ing, with the result that the gentleman is",24
NA,sitting behind the chair i n the place whicli,24
NA,was occupied jjreviously by book-shelves. I t,24
NA,seems to me that if there was a bar placed,24
NA,between the chair where he is sitting and,24
NA,the floor of the House this question could,24
NA,not arise. I understand that i t is your,24
NA,intention to have erected a bar or some-,24
NA,thing of tliat kind so that more con-,24
NA,venience may be given to a Minister who,24
NA,is i n charge of a Bill i n communicating,24
NA,with his chief clerk or under-secretary.,24
Mr SPEAKER , I may inform the,24
NA,House that on several occasions attention,24
NA,has been called to two facts. One is that,24
NA,the space in the Speaker's gallery is not,24
NA,quite sufficient on occasions when interest-,24
NA,"ing debates are proceeding, and that i t",24
NA,"would be a great convenience if,",24
NA,in addition to the space at the,24
NA,"far end of the chamber, there was some",24
NA,space outside the House available at this,24
NA,end. The other fact to which attention,24
NA,"has been called, as put by the Minister",24
NA,"for Home Affairs, is that any officer of",24
NA,Ministers when seated i n the Speaker's,24
NA,gallery is inaccessible for the purpose of the,24
NA,"business of the House, and that i f such",24
NA,"officer could find a seat, not i n the House",24
NA,"but outside tlie House at this end, i t would",24
NA,facilitate pubhc business. W i t h a view to,24
NA,"that being done, I arranged this morning",24
NA,"that some brass standards should be fixed,",24
NA,"and a division of a technical kind made, so",24
NA,"that the space behind the level of the screen,",24
NA,"at the back of the chair, should be con-",24
NA,"sidered outside the House, the space not",24
NA,only behind the screen but beyond the,24
NA,ends of the House on either side. So soon as,24
NA,"the technical divisional line is fixed, tliat will",24
NA,"be clearly, i n the opinion of all honorable",24
NA,"- members, outside the House, and therefore not",25
NA,within the operation of the standing orders.,25
NA,"I would suggest to the House that, in the",25
NA,"absence of such dividing line, any one sitting",25
NA,"in that space is on the floor of the chamber,",25
NA,and therefore can be directed to withdraw,25
NA,"under the standing order, and that pending",25
NA,"the erection of the dividing line, no notice",25
NA,be taken of any one sitting there.,25
NA,"HONOURABLE MEMBERS -Hear , hear.",25
Mr SALMON ,Laanecoorie) - I was re-,25
NA,sponsible for attention being called to this,25
NA,"matter, and had the explanation which you,",25
NA,"sir, have just made been given previous to",25
NA,"the sitting, I think there would have been",25
NA,no trouble at all. I am perfectly satisfied,25
NA,so long as the privileges of honorable mem-,25
NA,"bers are preserved. I regret, however, to",25
NA,hear that i t has been considered necessary,25
NA,"to remove the book-case, as i t. was always a",25
NA,useful place of reference. I might also say,25
NA,that the space behind the chair has been,25
NA,used in times past by honorable members to,25
NA,carry on necessary conversation without,25
NA,irritating those who are carrying on the,25
NA,"debate, or interfering with the progress of",25
NA,business i n the Chamber. But i f the,25
NA,exigencies of Ministers are such that i t is,25
NA,absolutely necessary that an officer should,25
NA,be within easy reach of the Minister at the,25
NA,"table, I can say nothing further. I am only",25
NA,too glad at any time to do all i n my power,25
NA,to assist the progress of business. A t the,25
NA,"same time, I would remark that i t is a good",25
NA,"many years since this Chamber was built,",25
NA,and this certamly is the first time that any,25
NA,Minister of State has found i t necessary to,25
NA,have an officer so near at hand as on the,25
NA,present occasion.,25
NA,In Gommittee :,25
NA,Clause 35-,25
NA,The Governor-General may from time to time-,25
NA,(a) create a new office in any division in any,25
NA,department on the request of the per-,25
NA,manent head thereof; or,25
NA,(ti) abolish any office in any department; or,25
NA,(c) raise or lower the classification or grading,25
NA,of any oflice the duties of which have,25
NA,been materially changed ; or,25
NA,(rf) transfer or promote an oflicer from the,25
NA,professional division to fill a vacancy,25
NA,in the clerical division if such officer,25
NA,has previously been in the clerical,25
NA,division and consents to such transfer,25
NA,or promotion ; or,25
NA,(e) transfer or promote an officer from the,25
NA,professional division,25
NA,to the special division.,25
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ,Went-,25
NA,worth) - I think the Minister for Home,25
NA,Affairs will see that to carry out the,25
NA,previous arrangement i t is necessaiy to,25
NA,"insert the words ""o n the recommendation",25
NA,"of the commissioner "" at the end of the first",25
NA,line.,25
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I have that amend-,25
NA,ment ready.,25
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , I move-,25
NA,"That the words "" on the recommendation ofthe",25
NA,"commissioner"" be inserted after the word ""time,""",25
NA,line 1.,25
Mr MCCOLL ,Echuca) - I presume the,25
NA,"words i n sub-clause (a) "" on tlie request of",25
NA,"the permanent head thereof "" apply not only",25
NA,"to that sub-clause, but also to sub-clauses",25
NA,"(b), (c), (d), and (e). As the clause is printed-",25
NA,i t would appear that the words applied only,25
NA,to the first sub-clause. I f they were made,25
NA,to apply to the wliole of the sub-clauses i t,25
NA,"would be much better, and i t would look",25
NA,better if there were inserted after tlie word,25
NA,""" commissioner.""",25
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ,I - think we,25
NA,might keep to the phraseology we adopted,25
NA,"before, and make the words apply to the",25
NA,whole of the sub-clauses.,25
Mr THOMSON ,North Sydney) - I do,25
NA,not know that i t would be advisable to ac-,25
NA,cept this addition in the form proposed.,25
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I was not going to,25
NA,"accept it , but the amendment was suggested",25
NA,and I did not object.,25
Mr THOMSON ,I t seems to me that,25
NA,under the amendment the report of the per-,25
NA,manent head would have to come before the,25
NA,commissioner could take action.,25
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , N o . I t means,25
NA,that the commissioner will act after receiv-,25
NA,ing a report from the permanent head.,25
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Th e report need not,25
NA,necessarily be in favour. The commissioner,25
NA,can act even if the report be opposed to the,25
NA,action.,25
Mr THOMSON , I quite see that the,25
NA,"report may not be i n favour, but the com-",25
NA,missioner has to receive a report before he,25
NA,can act-,25
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , T h a t is so i n,25
NA,the sense that the comniisioner acts after,25
NA,he obtains the report. He obtains the,25
NA,report to make sure he is right.,25
Mr THOMSON,The h I should say,25
NA,"""after obtaining a report.""",25
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , V e r y w e l l ; I will,25
NA,or clerical division accept those words.,25
Mr THOMSON ,Th e abolition of an,25
NA,office i n a department is a matter i n which,25
NA,the commissioner has to keep a watch on the,25
NA,"permanent head, who may not be willing",25
NA,to abolish an office wliich the commisabolish any office in any department.,26
NA,sioner says is not necessary.,26
Mr MCCOLL ,Th e commissioner has a,26
NA,right to get the permanent head's views on,26
NA,the question.,26
Mr THOMSON ,"Yes , so long as we do",26
NA,not commit the commissioner to the neces-,26
NA,sity of first getting a report before he moves.,26
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , T h e permaunder,26
NA,nent head is not given the initiative.,26
Mr WILKS ,Dalley) -Th e clause is an,26
NA,"important one, dealing, as i t does, with",26
NA,"grading and classification, and i t is only",26
NA,right tlie commissioner should have the,26
NA,fullest control possible. I am afraid,26
NA,the introduction of the permanent head,26
NA,this provision will be more dangerous,26
NA,in clause 21.,26
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Th e permanent head,26
NA,"has simply to report, and no matter what",26
NA,he says the commissioner can act.,26
Mr WILKS ," I f that be so, I am satis-",26
NA,fied. But while there are transfers from,26
NA,"the clerical to the professional division, and",26
NA,"vice versa, there is no power to transfer",26
NA,from the general division to the clerical.,26
NA,tlie general division there may be numbers not know why.,26
NA,"of men, faithful and proved servants,",26
NA,who have no opportunity of competing,26
NA,amongst themselves for advance to the,26
NA,clerical division. A telegraph messenger,26
NA,may prove himself a faithfu l servant as a,26
NA,"member of the general division, but before",26
NA,"he can be advanced or transferred, he would,",26
NA,"under the clause, have to go into open comthe",26
NA,"petition with tbe general public, probably",26
NA,"boys and girls who had just left school,",26
NA,and could more easily pass an examination.,26
NA,The clerical and professional divisions have,26
NA,the right of competing amongst,26
NA,"*or transfer, and I ask that a telegraph",26
NA,"messenger, who has shown efficiency during",26
NA,"long years of service, should have the equal",26
NA,privilege of advancing himself by competithat,26
NA,tion with his fellows.,26
Mr ISAACS ,Indi) - I would suggest,26
NA,to the Minister that he should do what has,26
NA,"been done in the B u i previously, when I",26
NA,"think the Attorney-General was i n charge,",26
NA,"namely, to strike out i n line 1, the words,",26
NA,"""from time to time"" as unnecessary.",26
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I propose to strike doing so.,26
NA,those words out-th e amendment is to,26
NA,strike them out.,26
Mr ISAACS , I would like an explana-,26
NA,tion i n regard to some other parts of the,26
NA,clause. I n sub-clause (b) power is given,26
NA,What,26
NA,is to become of the oflicer 1,26
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Tha t depends on,26
NA,circumstances. H e may be transferred i n,26
NA,the same department or to another depart-,26
NA,ment if there is a place for him.,26
Mr ISAACS ,I f the officer is not re-,26
NA,"quired i n any department, he is to come",26
NA,"the operation of a previous clause,",26
NA,and go out altogether.,26
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Yes .,26
Mr ISAACS ,I n sub-clause (d) why is,26
NA,the privilege given only to the professional,26
NA,division to be transferred or promoted to,26
NA,that the clerical division 1 Is there any,26
NA,into reason why similar power should not,26
NA,than be given to transfer and promote,26
NA,an officer from the clerical to the profes-,26
NA,sional division 1 I should like to hear i f,26
NA,there is any reason why preference is given,26
NA,to one division. I n the Victorian Public,26
NA,Service Acts that distinction is not made.,26
Mr CROUCH ,I t looks as i f i t had been,26
NA,drafted to meet some special case.,26
Mr ISAACS , I t may have been,26
NA,"I n drafted to meet some special case, but I do",26
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Th e officer w i l l have,26
NA,to go through an examination.,26
Mr ISAACS ,"I f that be so, there is",26
NA,all the more reason to give the power to,26
NA,transfer or promote a clerical oflicer to the,26
NA,"professional division. I f he is efficient, and",26
NA,his competency must be tested i n the way,26
NA,"Minister suggests, then thei'e can be no",26
NA,"objection to giving, i n regard to promotion",26
NA,"from the clerical to professional division,",26
NA,similar power to that given i n the converse,26
NA,case. That measure of justice is provided in,26
NA,themselves the A ictorian Acts.,26
NA,7,26
Mr POYNTON ,South Australia) - I,26
NA,"was just about to refer to that question,",26
NA,and what makes me more inclined to think,26
NA,the suggestion of the honorable and,26
NA,learned member for I n d i should be carried,26
NA,out is tliat all these advances or promotions,26
NA,are to be on examination. The whole,26
NA,structure of the Bill is to encourage people,26
NA,"to aspire to get to the top, and if any one i n",26
NA,the cleric.il division can qualify for the pro-,26
NA,"fessional division, there ought not to be",26
NA,anything i n the Bill to debar him from,26
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I wish to make an,26
NA,amendment i n the first line of the clause.,26
The CHAIRMAN , I t will be necessaiy,26
NA,for the honorable member for Wentworth to,26
NA,to withdraw his amendment temporarily.,26

Mr HIGGINS ,Northern Melbourne) -,27
NA,"The honorable"" member for South Australia,",27
NA,"Mr Poynton, has, 1 understand, got a",27
NA,theory which he wishes to work out-tlia t,27
NA,a man i n the general division may be trans-,27
NA,ferred to the clerical division with examina-,27
NA,tion.,27
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,T o the professional division,27
NA,"division, too.",27
Mr HIGGINS , I tliink I can give,27
NA,"some explanation' of the matter, which he",27
NA,I dealt with last night i n a differ-,27
NA,ent aspect. I n the Victorian ' Public,27
NA,"Service Act, section 52, power is given",27
NA,to the Governor i u Council on the recombe,27
NA,mendation of the Public Service Board to,27
NA,transfer a man from the general,27
NA,the clerical division on examination. A,27
NA,man who is in the general division has not,27
NA,to pass so stiff an examination as a man,27
NA,"would in the clerical division, and he has by",27
NA,no means the qualifications of a man i n the,27
NA,professional or special division. I last night,27
NA,"suggested an amendment, to whicli the tion. . . .",27
NA,"Attorney-General, said he would give effect",27
NA,at the proper place. The suggested amenda,27
NA,"ment was on clause 28, and preserves the",27
NA,rights of Victorian men i n the general,27
NA,division to be transferred to the clerical,27
NA,division on pissing an examination.,27
Mr WILKS ,By competition amongst,27
NA,themselves 1,27
Mr HIGGINS ,Tha t was left open. A,27
NA,all events the men were to have their,27
NA,sent rights preserved under the Bill.,27
Mr THOMSON ,Onl y the Victorian men 1,27
Mr HIGGINS , I am not aware that,27
NA,the other States have a similar provision.,27
NA,should be only too happy to provide for,27
NA,the same privileges being obtained for the,27
NA,other States i f there are those privileges,27
NA,now; and I hope i t will be understood,27
NA,not making any distinction between Victorian,27
NA,men and others. I happen to know that i n,27
NA,LYNE) the Victorian A c t there is power to transfer,27
NA,"to the clerical division, and I do not see",27
NA,why that power should be taken away under,27
NA,the Commonwealth.,27
Mr THOMSON ,Eve n i f that privilege is,27
NA,not i n the other States i t should be ex-,27
NA,tended to them.,27
Mr HIGGINS , I think i t ought to,27
NA,"be, seeing that i t is only ou examination.",27
NA,I t would be only fair to extend i t to all the,27
NA,"States, and I shallgive the honorable",27
NA,member any assistance in my power to,27
NA,"enable the transfers to be made, so far as I",27
NA,"can see at present, unless the Minister",27
NA,shows the contrary. May I point out that,27
NA,clause 35 does not deal with transfers on,27
NA,".examination, but deals with transfers with-",27
NA,out examination absolutely.,27
Mr WILKS , I t is a privilege.,27
Mr HIGGINS , I t .is a privilege i n the,27
NA,sense that a man who is i n the professional,27
NA,is ex lvypotliesi f i t for the clerical,27
NA,division.,27
An HONOURABLE MEMBER ,Especiall y i f,27
NA,has been i n the clerical division before.,27
Mr HIGGINS ,Exactl y ; especially if he,27
NA,has been i n the clerical division before. Then,27
NA,sub-clause (e) provides that an officer may,27
NA,transferred or promoted from the pro-,27
NA,fessional division or the clerical division to,27
NA,division to the special division.,27
Mr POYNTON ,Loo k at clause 37.,27
Mr HIGGINS ,Claus e 37 r e a d s -,27
NA,No officer shall be promoted from a class in,27
NA,the professional division or clerical division to a,27
NA,higher class or be transferred from one depart-,27
NA,ment to another unless he has passed such examina-,27
NA,That clause really deals with classes within,27
NA,division. A l l I want to point out is that,27
NA,we are now dealing with cases of transfer,27
NA,"without examination, and we ought not to",27
NA,"confuse the two things. We shall provide,",27
NA,in the clause which the Attorney-General is,27
NA,"going to bring in, for all cases of transfer with",27
NA,examination. The Attorney-General has,27
NA,t undertaken tliat he will i n due place have,27
NA,prea clause providing for transfer from the,27
NA,general division on examination.,27
Mr DEAKIN , -That was done last night.,27
Mr HIGGINS ,The n that is all right.,27
NA,I would suggest that in clause 35 we do,27
NA,not. deal with anything except the question,27
NA,of movements i n the public service without,27
NA,"examination, by tlie Governor i n Council",27
NA,I am after the recommendation of the commis-,27
NA,sioner and perhaps on the report of the,27
NA,permanent head. I think the two things are,28
NA,"distinct, and this would he a bad place to",28
NA,bring in tlie amendment which tlie honor-,28
NA,"able member for South Australia, Mr Poyn-",28
NA,"ton, has suggested.",28
Mr ISAACS ,Indi) -Th e view that I,28
NA,have previously expressed I . desire to put,28
NA,before the committee i n a concrete form by,28
NA,moving an amendment. I hardly know the,28
NA,"best way in which ito do this, but I wish to",28
NA,give the Governor-General power to transfer,28
NA,"or promote an officer from the clerical,",28
NA,division to fil l a vacancy i n the professional,28
NA,division i f such officer is competent and con-,28
NA,sents to such promotion. There are many,28
NA,gentlemen in the clerical division who are,28
NA,"really professional men, but simply because",28
NA,they are in the clerical division the Gover-,28
NA,nor-General has no power to put them into,28
NA,a position which they are competent to,28
NA,fill. I t is within the discretion of the,28
NA,"permanent head, the commissioner, and the",28
NA,Governoi-'General to say whether any officer,28
NA,shall be promoted. But we know that there,28
NA,are members of the clerical division who,28
NA,have qualified themselves by examination to,28
NA,"be professional men, and I see no reason",28
NA,"why, when a vacancy occurs i n the pro-",28
NA,"fessional division, they should not be eligible",28
NA,"to fill i t , Under this clause there is no",28
NA,power i n such a. case to transfer them from,28
NA,"the clerical to the professional division,",28
NA,although there is power under the Bill to,28
NA,transfer an officer from the general division,28
NA,to the clerical division. I therefore move-,28
NA,"That the following words be added, after the",28
NA,"word ""or"" in sub-clause (rf):-""transfe r or pro-",28
NA,mote au officer from the clerical division to fill a,28
NA,vacancy in the professional division if such officer,28

Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I wil l accept,28

Mr BATCHELOR ,South,28
NA,Does not this clause refer to promotions,28
NA,apart from examinations altogether 1,28
Mr MAUGER , I t only refers to altera-,28
NA,tions of the staff.,28
Mr BATCHELOR ,Th e honorable and,28
NA,learned member for I n d i suggests that there,28
NA,should be promotions from the clerical divi-,28
NA,sion to the professional division.,28
Mr ISAACS ,Everythin g else is provided,28
NA,for.,28
Mr BATCHELOR , I t seems to me,28
NA,unnecessary so far as this clause is con-,28
NA,"cerned, that the officer shall have passed",28
NA,the examination. I have been looking at,28
NA,the clause from tlie point of view that,28
NA,i t is not laid down tliat a man shall have,28
NA,to pass another examination. I agree with,28
NA,"the honorable and learned member for Indi,",28
NA,that we ought to give the same opportuni-,28
NA,ties to the clerical division as are given,28
NA,to the professional division. We ought-,28
NA,also to give the same advantages to,28
NA,the members of the general division. W e,28
NA,must not make any distinction between the,28
NA,various divisions of the service. We want,28
NA,to throw the whole service open to any man,28
NA,in the ranks. We must not give privileges,28
NA,to the professional and clerical divisions,28
NA,which we donot give to the general division.,28
NA,I f i t is right that power should be given to,28
NA,promote an officer from either the clerical or,28
NA,"the professional division, i t is equally just",28
NA,that a similar power should be given to pro-,28
NA,mote an officer from the general division.,28
NA,There should be no barrier to the advance-,28
NA,ment of an)' oflicer altogether irrespective,28
NA,of tlie particular division to whicli he be-,28
NA,longs. I beheve that i t will be necessary,28
NA,to insert another sub-clause giving the,28
NA,Governor-General power to transfer or pro-,28
NA,mote an oflicer from the general division to,28
NA,tlie clerical or professional division. As,28
NA,soon as the amendment before the com-,28
NA,mittee-is disposed of I shall move in that,28
NA,direction.,28
Mr DEAKIN ,Tha t is unnecessary. A,28
NA,man must get from the general to the cleri-,28
NA,cal division first. We have given him the,28
NA,power to do that.,28
Mr CROUCH ,Corio) - I tliink that -,28
NA,the amendment of the honorable and learned,28
NA,"member for Inch is unnecessary, be-",28
NA,cause clause 27 saj's that before an ap-,28
NA,pointment can be made to the special or,28
NA,professional division from outside the ser-,28
NA,the,28
NA,vice certain requirements have to be complied,28
NA,with. I t appears to me that the honorable,28
NA,Australia) - ancl learned member for I n d i is attempt-,28
NA,ing to bring i n a clause by which an oflicer,28
NA,may be brought from the clerical to the pro-,28
NA,fessional division. I think the amendment,28
NA,is surplusage. I t is already inferred that a,28
NA,person must be taken from the clerical to,28
NA,the professional division unless strong,28
NA,reasons are given why the transfer is not,28
NA,"made. I f clause 27 does not imply that,",28
NA,there is really no reason by which an,28
NA,appointment can be made to the special,28
NA,division. The only definite power given to,28
NA,appoint any person at all is provided for,28
NA,in clause 27. There are no words giving,28
NA,any authority for an appointment to a,28
NA,professional division. I t must be inferred that,29
NA,i t is a general authority which is left to the,29
NA,Governor-General i n Council. I think that,29
NA,we ought to strengthen the clause some-,29
NA,"where, but I do not tliink i t is necessary to",29
NA,do so i n the way that the honorable and,29
NA,learned member for Ind i indicates.,29
Mr WILKS ,Dalley) - I understood the,29
NA,honorable and learned member for Northern,29
NA,Melbourne to say just now that the A t -,29
NA,torney-General had drafted a clause pro-,29
NA,viding that an oflicer from the general divi-,29
NA,sion could advance by means of a competitive,29
NA,exaniination to the clerical division.,29
Mr DEAKIN ,"Yes , we carried that last",29
NA,night.,29
Mr WILKS , T h e n I have nothing fur-,29
NA,ther to say.,29
Mr EWING ,Richmond) - I presume,29
NA,that what the committee is endeavouring to,29
NA,do under this clause is to provide for cer-,29
NA,tain cases that might possibly eventuate.,29
NA,These sub-clauses do not overcome the,29
NA,difficulties that will beset the commissioner,29
NA,in the administration of the Act. Actual,29
NA,experiences will probably prove that we,29
NA,are not prophets. I think i t would be well,29
NA,"to eliminate sub-clauses (c), (d), and (e), and",29
NA,to substitute a general provision giving the,29
NA,"Governor-General power to transfer, pro-",29
NA,"mote, ancl grade any officer after such",29
NA,examination as may be deemed necessary.,29
NA,That would cover the whole clause. I t is,29
NA,impossible for this committee to foresee,29
NA,everything that will happen. I t would be,29
NA,"wise, therefore, if, instead of attempting to",29
NA,"particularize difficulties that may arise, we",29
NA,inserted some general provision such as I,29
NA,have suggested. I am sure that that is the,29
NA,"right thing for the service, and the wisest",29
NA,course to pursue i n regard to the administra-,29
NA,tion. I t is preferable to give general powers.,29
NA,I hope that the committee will accept that,29
NA,"view of the situation, if they conclude that",29
NA,tliere is not too much clanger i n so doing.,29
Mr THOMSON ,Will the Minister,29
NA,Home Affairs accept the amendment 1,29
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Yes .,29
Mr THOMSON ,North Sydney) - I,29
NA,am inclined to agree with the honorable,29
NA,member for Richmond that in the sub-,29
NA,clause i t might be better to say-,29
NA,Transfer or promote an oflicer from one division,29
NA,to another division on such conditions and after,29
NA,such examinations as may bc prescribed.,29
Mr DEAKIN ,Tha t is the effect of i t as,29
NA,i t stands.,29
Mr THOMSON ," No, there is no",29
NA,provision made for the special division.,29
NA,I f an officer of the professional division,29
NA,happened to prefer an aj)pointment i n the,29
NA,"special division, and the commissioner de-",29
NA,"sired that he should fill such office, the",29
NA,amendment of the honorable ancl learned,29
NA,member for Inch would not cover that case.,29
NA,Would i t not meet all the conditions and,29
NA,include the clerical division if sub-section (d),29
NA,were amended in the way I have suggested ?,29
Mr ISAACS ,Inch) - I know very well,29
NA,the difficulties of a Minister sitting at,29
NA,the table in tlie making of amendments. I,29
NA,"suggest, therefore, that the amendments be",29
NA,"taken separately, and afterwards the Min-",29
NA,ister will be able to see how far he can weld,29
NA,them together. Otherwise he may do more,29
NA,"or less than he desires, and more or less than",29
NA,the committee desire. What I suggest seems,29
NA,to me to be the best way to bring the whole,29
NA,clause into a symmetrical form.,29
NA,Amendment agreed to.,29
Mr BATCHELOR ,South Australia) -,29
NA,I cannot quite see that what we agreed to,29
NA,last night covers exactly the same position,29
NA,as the cases that are referred to i n this,29
NA,"clause, and for that reason I would move-",29
NA,That the followiug words be inserted as an ad-,29
NA,"ditional sub-clause :- "" (/)Transferorpromotean",29
NA,officer from the general division to the clerical,29
NA,"division."" -",29
Mr DEAKIN ,Ballarat-Attorney ',29
NA,General) -I f that is clone i t will ren-,29
NA,der the work done last night un-,29
NA,"necessary ; in fact, i t will substitute for i t",29
NA,the widest opening for action by the Com-,29
NA,missioner or the Governor-General given in,29
NA,the Bill. Although the clause has been,29
NA,correctly described by the honorahle and,29
NA,learned member for Northern Melbourne,29
NA,"as referring to transfers, ancl what",29
NA,may in one sense be promotions with-,29
NA,"out examination, yet as I read this clause",29
NA,with the rest of the Bill I take i t that the,29
NA,transfers and so-called promotions cannot,29
NA,for imply tlie advance which according to the rest,29
NA,of tlie Bill presupposes tliat an examination,29
NA,has been passed. I n this clause certain,29
NA,powers are provided that might be called,29
NA,"administrative, intended to be exercised",29
NA,within the framework whicli we have,29
NA,"already established. Eirst of all, there is",29
NA,the creation of a new offiee; that will not in-,29
NA,terfere with tlie framework of the Bill. Then,29
NA,"again, an office may be abolished, and that",29
NA,will not interfere with the framework of the,29
NA,Bill. Then i t may be necessaiy to raise or,29
NA,lower the classification or grading of any,30
NA,"office, and that will not interfere with the",30
NA,framework of the Bill. Then we come to the,30
NA,last two sub-clauses upon whicli we have had,30
NA,"this discussion, relating to the transfer or",30
NA,promotion of officers from one division to,30
NA,"another, and I would point out that tiiis",30
NA,power has to be included somewhere or,30
NA,"other i n the Bill, otherwise we shall have",30
NA,what might be taken to be water-tight,30
NA,compartments i n the service. We have,30
NA,"divided tlie service into the general, clerical,",30
NA,"professional, and administrative divisions.",30
NA,We have the power to regrade the clerical,30
NA,division; there is no power of interchange,30
NA,between i t and others. This,30
NA,now proposed to be given is not to be,30
NA,exercised i n conflict with the rest of the,30
NA,"Bill, but subject to the provisions as to",30
NA,"exaniination, which have to be complied",30
NA,with before we can take a man from one,30
NA,division and place him i n another.,30
Mr HIGGINS ,"Accordin g to tliis clause,",30
NA,a man may pass -from the professional,30
NA,division into the clerical division without,30
NA,examination.,30
Mr DEAKIN , Y e s ; but the provision,30
NA,is that an oflicer who has pre viously been in,30
NA,"the clerical division, and who had clerical",30
NA,"qualifications, may be passed from the pro-",30
NA,fessional division back into the clerical divi-,30
NA,sion. He -must have had professional,30
NA,qualifications before he passed into the,30
NA,professional division ; and i f he wants .to,30
NA,get back into the division from which he was,30
NA,"first transferred, he must have had the",30
NA,necessary qualification for tliat division be-,30
NA,fore he could originally enter i t . I think,30
NA,the honorable and learned member for,30
NA,Northern Melbourne was quite correct in his,30
NA,"description of tine clause, but the honorable",30
NA,"member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor,",30
NA,has drawn a mistaken inference from a,30
NA,correct statement of its provisions.,30
NA,thinks that this clause gives power of,30
NA,"promotion without examination, but i n the",30
NA,cases refened to in the clause the examina-,30
NA,"tion must have been already passed, and as",30
NA,a matter of fact the oflicer must have quali-,30
NA,fied himself for both divisions before being,30
NA,enabled to pass from one division to the,30
NA,other.,30
Mr HIOGINS ,Unde r sub-clause (<?) there,30
NA,is no examination provided for.,30
Mr DEAKIN , N o ; and that is the,30
NA,one exemption we have-- made. That,30
NA,"division, which is the great administrative",30
NA,"division, is one to which men may be drawn",30
NA,from all the other divisions of the service if,30
NA,they possess the necessary qualifications.,30
NA,These are the chief officer's who rise to the,30
NA,summits of tlieir various divisions i n the,30
NA,"service, and who are naturally chosen",30
NA,from them to act as heads of de-,30
NA,partments. Some of the heads of depart-,30
NA,"ments come from the clerical division, and",30
NA,"some come from the professional division,",30
NA,and some may have come from the general,30
NA,"division, but they require first of all to have",30
NA,passed either the clerical or the professional,30
NA,examinations.,30
Mr BATOHELOB ,No t necessarily.,30
Mr DEAKIN , Y e s ; we could not take,30
NA,power a man from the general division into either,30
NA,the clerical or professional divisions without,30
NA,an examination.,30
Mr BATCBELOB ,Woul d you not take a,30
NA,man like an electrical engineer from the,30
NA,"general division, and put him into the pro-",30
NA,"fessional division without examination, i n",30
NA,order to take up the position of Superin-,30
NA,"tendent of Telegraphs, for instance ?",30
Mr DEAKIN , - I cannot imagine an,30
NA,electrical engineer being classified in the,30
NA,general division if his attainments were of,30
NA,such a character as to enable him to take up,30
NA,a position of that sort; he would have,30
NA,reached the dignity of the professional,30
NA,division.,30
Mr BATCHELOH ,But how is he going to,30
NA,get from the general division 1,30
Mr DEAKIN , W e provided for that,30
NA,last night. The general division includes,30
NA,that vast nondescript body of employes,30
NA,in which a certain amount of manual skill,30
NA,is often required ; but beyond manual skill,30
NA,and physical capacity and average intelli-,30
NA,gence nothing more is required. I f a man,30
NA,pursues his studies i n some particular,30
NA,direction and rises out of the general into,30
NA,"the professional division, he ceases to",30
NA,He become an officer of the general division,30
NA,and becomes a professional division oflicer.,30
NA,Men i n the general division with such,30
NA,qualifications can pass into the two higher,30
NA,"divisions, and take up the highest adminis-",30
NA,trative positions. I suppose tlie highest,30
NA,salary i n the general division would be,30
NA,Â£ 2 0 0 or Â£ 3 0 0 a year; and surely an,30
NA,electrical engineer of high attainments,30
NA,would be in receipt of a higher salary than,30
NA,that.,30
Mr HIGGINS ,Bu t supposing a man,30
NA,"qualifies himself, by working after hours, and",30
NA,"becomes professional i n capacity, why should",30
NA,he not be moved up 1,30
Mr DEAKIN , T h e n lie can obtain,31
NA,ployment in the professional division.,31
Mr HIGGINS ,Under what clause would,31
NA,he pass from one division to the other t,31
Mr DEAKIN , T h e mode of entering,31
NA,the professional division will be pro-,31
NA,vided for by regulations under clause 71.,31
NA,'We shall not have a great many men of any,31
NA,kind i n the professional division;. but we,31
NA,shall require to make regulations to embrace,31
NA,every one of the professions likely to be,31
NA,required in the public service and to provide,31
NA,also means of discriminating between men,31
NA,who are in leading positions i n the general,31
NA,"division, and who pass from that divi-",31
NA,sion into the professional division. Under,31
NA,"clause 71, sub-clause (Â«), we shall arrange",31
NA,"the professional division into classes, and",31
NA,"the general division into grades, ancl",31
NA,shall determine the limits of salaries to,31
NA,be paid to the persons in such classes,31
NA,"or grades, ancl the man who rises in the",31
NA,"general division, up to a certain grade, will",31
NA,"pass into the professional division, because",31
NA,that will be the grade at which the,31
NA,professional division begins.,31
Mr BATCHELOR ,Bu t that means that a,31
NA,man will have to pass through all the grades,31
NA,"in the general division, which may take him",31
NA,"twenty years, before he will be regarded as",31
NA,eligible for transfer to the professional,31
NA,division.,31
Mr DEAKIN ," W e l l , if the honorable",31
NA,"member chooses to imagine twenty years, I",31
NA,"atn afraid I cannot help him, but",31
NA,there is no such requirement in the,31
NA,clause. The regular grades are those,31
NA,in the clerical division; but there will,31
NA,not be the same grades in the other divi-,31
NA,"sions, and we shall have to adopt a special",31
NA,"classification for electrical engineers, for",31
NA,"actuaries, ancl other special officers.",31
NA,Mr HrocsiNS -Th e difficulty of the,31
NA,honorable member for South Anstralia is,31
NA,that he-cunnot see any provision made for,31
NA,the man who qualifies himself by study for a,31
NA,higher division.,31
Mr DEAKIN , I have already stated,31
NA,that i t must be dealt with in tlie clause,31
NA,providing for regulations covering the pro-,31
NA,fessional division and which has not yet been,31
NA,passed. But as these regulations will have,31
NA,"to be laid before Parliament, that will be",31
NA,the time to challenge them. The provision,31
NA,that the honorable member for South Aus-,31
NA,"tralia indicates, does not, I admit, appear",31
NA,"in the Bill, and the proposal he now makes",31
NA,must be nugatory. This clause is not,31
NA,emintended to afford any means of evading,31
NA,the ordinary conditions attached to promo-,31
NA,"tion at all, but is designed to allow that",31
NA,"interchange between the departments, which",31
NA,is so necessary to secure efficiency and effec-,31
NA,tiveness and to deal with such advancement,31
NA,as does not require an examination. The,31
NA,"word ""promote"" is perhaps responsible for",31
NA,some misapprehension on this subject. This,31
NA,was regarded as a convenient clause for,31
NA,gathering together certain powers which are,31
NA,essential to the general administration of,31
NA,"the service, and they are not intended to",31
NA,affect the general framework of the Bill or,31
NA,its requirements relating to promotion or,31
NA,transfer.,31
Mr BATCHELOR ,South Australia) -,31
NA,I thank the honorable the Attorney-General,31
NA,for the information wliich he has given us.,31
NA,Although what he has said undoubtedly,31
NA,"clears some of the ground, I would point out",31
NA,that whatever regulations may be made or,31
NA,prescribed for the gradual advancement of,31
NA,"officers in the general division, I think",31
NA,i t desirable that some provision should be,31
NA,made for tlie transfer from tlie general,31
NA,"to the professional division of young officers,",31
NA,"who take up such a line as engineering, and",31
NA,"who, possibly, whilst still young, properly",31
NA,qualify themselves for a . higher class of,31
NA,employment. The honorable the Attorney-,31
NA,General says that the regulations will,31
NA,"provide the means, but I . do not see why we",31
NA,"should not provide for i t in the Bill, just as",31
NA,we have provided for other cases.,31
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,I f the honorable,31
NA,"member lets the matter rest, I can assure",31
NA,him tliat the regulations will provide for,31
NA,the transfer of such men into the pro-,31
NA,fessional division.,31
Mr BATCHELOR ,I f tliehonorabletlie,31
NA,Minister will undertake to say that the re-,31
NA,gulations will provide for a man of special,31
NA,"qualifications skipping some of the grades,",31
NA,and going into the professional division,31
NA,"direct, without waiting perhaps 30 or 40",31
NA,"years, I shall be content.",31
Mr HIGGINS ,Northern Melbourne) -,31
NA,The whole matter rests upon a very narrow,31
NA,issue. The Attorney-3eneral says there is,31
NA,"power under clause 71, sub-clause (a), to",31
NA,make regulations which will allow of a man,31
NA,"who is i n the general division, and who has",31
NA,"qualified himself for professional duties, en-",31
NA,"tering tlie professional division. I find,",31
NA,"however, that clause 71 does not give that",31
NA,power.,31
Mr DEAKIN ,-W e will widen i t to meet,32
NA,the case.,32
Mr HIGGINS , I f the honorable the,32
NA,Minister for Home Affairs will enlarge the,32
NA,powers given under Clause 71 so as to per-,32
NA,mit of i t being prescribed by regulation that,32
NA,a man may enter the professional division,32
NA,"in the way desired, that will answer the",32
NA,purpose.,32
Mr EWING ,Richmond) -- I do not think,32
NA,we should leave this question until we are,32
NA,"perfectly satisfied that we are doing the permanent head.""",32
NA,what is right. What the House wants,32
NA,to do is to give the executive heads of secretary,32
NA,the service the power to get competent the,32
NA,men wherever they are to be obtained.,32
NA,The ordinary clerical man looks upon a,32
NA,"messenger as an inferior individual, and",32
NA,"if a man starts his life as a messenger,",32
NA,he will probably end i t as a messenger.,32
NA,We want only one thing to be recognised,32
NA,"under this Bill, and that is merit;",32
NA,we should require the commissioner to,32
NA,"recognise merit wherever he may find i t , put i t in.",32
NA,whether i t be i n the general division or,32
NA,elsewhere. I f the Attorney-General agrees,32
NA,"with us, as he says he does, why",32
NA,insert a clause giving power to transfer,32
NA,or promote an officer from one division,32
NA,to another after examination wherever,32
NA,i t may be necessary. Afte r this Bill,32
NA,"passed we shall be bound by i t , and then move-",32

Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I would hke the,33
NA,lionorable member to leave that matter over,33
NA,unti l we come to the question of the regula-,33

NA,"do not want to put i t in here, and make i t",33
NA,superfluous i f we can bring i t under the,33

Mr MCCOLL ,Echuca) - I understand,33
NA,"that the words ""after obtaining a report",33
NA,"from the permanent head "" have not been in-",33
NA,serted in the clause. I t was agreed that we,33
NA,should adopt a uniform practice right,33
NA,"through the Bill, and therefore I think that",33

Mr ISAACS ," Yes, under clause 37",33

Mr HIGGI NS ,Northern Melbourne) -,34

NA,aminations - I know that since I raised,34
NA,the question i t has excited some attention,34
NA,amongst those who are perfectly familiar,34
NA,with the work which may be done by the,34
NA,"Universities, and tliose who have spoken are",34

NA,"aminers and machinery, without incurring",34
NA,much expense i n the selection of the,34
NA,men to do the work of the Common-,34

NA,would fit into clauses 23 and 24. But I ask,34

Mr HUME COOK , I want to follow,35

NA,I now submit is in the terms of a clause,35
NA,which was moved when the last Public,35
NA,Service Bill of Victoria was before Parlia-,35
NA,ment. The clause was lost on the advice of,35
NA,"the Government, and the result has been",35
NA,that the A ct has affected most injuriously a,35
NA,number of most deserving men. As a con-,35
NA,"sequence of this, there has been a kind of",35
NA,federation amongst the public servants of,35
NA,"New South AVales, Soutli Australia, and Vic-",35
NA,"toria, who desire that such a clause as I have",35
NA,now moved should be inserted in the Bill.,35
NA,I t does not interfere in any way with the,35
NA,"merit provisions of the Bill, but merely gives",35
NA,a guarantee to officers generally that no,35
NA,junior will be appointed where a senior is,35

Mr ISAACS ,Th e honorable member will,35

Mr HUME COOK , -I am not particular,35

NA,inserted.,35
Mr ISAACS ,I s that necessary ?,35
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I am informed,35
NA,that i t is necessary.,35
NA,Amendment agreed to.,35
Mr HIGGINS ,Northern Melbourne) -,35
NA,I t appears to me that sub-clause (2) requires,35
NA,to be reconsidered and redrawn. I t con-,35
NA,tains an extraordinary and drastic power.,35
NA,I t provides that no officer is to refuse com-,35
NA,"pliance, with an order of the Minister direct-",35
NA,ing his removal from one position to,35
NA,another. Neither is such officer to,35
NA,refuse compliance with a similar order,35
NA,issued by the permanent head of his,35
NA,department. Either the Minister or the,35
NA,"permanent head, therefore, can tell a man",35
NA,that he must move from Hobart to Port,35
NA,"Darwin, or from Coolgardie to the Rich-",35
NA,"mond River, next week. The sub-clause",35
NA,1 also sets out that disregard or disobedience,35
NA,of any sucli order sliall be followed by dis-,35
NA,"missal. According to this provision, i t is",35
NA,possible that the Minister may order one,36
NA,way and the permanent head another way :,36
NA,"and, i f an officer shall disobey either of such",36
NA,"orders, he shall be dismissed.",36
Mr MAUGISK ,Tha t is too arbitrary.,36
Mr HIGGINS , I t is too arbitrary. I,36
NA,thought when i t came to a question of the re-,36
NA,moval of an officer from one part of the Com-,36
NA,monwealtli to another-sa y from the post-,36
NA,"office at Coolgardie, to the post-office at the",36
NA,"Richmond River, New South ""Wales-tha t",36
NA,i t would not be the Minister who would,36
NA,"order i t , but the commissioner. I t is just",36
NA,here that political influence comes in.,36
NA,I f a permanent head has a grudge against a,36
NA,man-an d there are such things-h e may,36
NA,make that man's life unbearable by saying-,36
NA,""" You must go off to a certain distant part",36
NA,"of the Commonwealth."" On the other hand,",36
NA,"a Minister, i f he is cajoled sufficiently, may",36
NA,remove an officer from a hot climate like,36
NA,that of Coolgardie to a pleasant place like,36
NA,Geelong.,36
Mr MAHON ,Coolgardi e has a very good,36
NA,climate.,36
Mr HIGGINS ," A t all events, i t",36
NA,seems to return good men.,36
NA,glad that tlie atmosphere of Coolgardie has,36
NA,not made some men degenerate. I think,36
NA,that this sub-clause needs reconstruction.,36
NA,"We must at least make i t consistent, and say",36
NA,that an officer must obey either the Min-,36
NA,ister or the permanent head of his depart-,36
NA,"ment, and not both.",36
Sir GEORGE TURNER ,On e is,36
NA,department-th e other is outside.,36
Mr HIGGINS ,Unde r tlie sub-clause i t,36
NA,is quite possible for the permanent head to,36
NA,say,36
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , P u t in the words-,36
NA,""" Upon the report ofthe commissioner.""",36
Mr HIGGINS , I tliink even then that,36
NA,the provisions of the clause will conflict. I t is,36
NA,quite possible for the Minister to order the,36
NA,removal of an officer within the Postal de-,36
NA,partment from one end of the Common-,36
NA,"wealth to the other, and for a permanent",36
NA,head to order removal in a different direction.,36
NA,I t would be impossible for an officer to,36
NA,comply with conflicting orders. I think,36
NA,that i n regard to the penalty to be im-,36
NA,posed i n case of disobedience the word,36
NA,"""may"" should be substituted for ""shall""",36
NA,in regard to dismissal.,36
Mr MCCOLL ,Echuca) -Woul d i t not,36
NA,be well to insert a provision by which a man,36
NA,would be allowed the option of appealing to,36
NA,tlie commissioner 1 Why should not a man,36
NA,"be allowed to decline achange if he finds,after",36
NA,"looking at the circumstances of the case, that",36
NA,i t is desirable so to do ? This question of re-,36
NA,movals gives rise to great trouble in the,36
NA,departments. Of course - I recognise that,36
NA,there may be a great many conditions con-,36
NA,"nected with a man's circumstances, such,",36
NA,"for example, as liis health, or the health of",36
NA,"his wife and family,-which ought fairly to",36
NA,be taken into consideration. The work,36
NA,"of the State must be carried on, and a man",36
NA,ought not to be allowed from a mere,36
NA,"whim or caprice to decline removal"" from",36
NA,one place to another. But he ought to be,36
NA,allowed to go to the commissioner i n order,36
NA,that an arbitrary injustice mav not be done.,36
Mr POYNTON ,South Australia) -,36
NA,There is another phase of the question. I n,36
NA,some cases i t would probably be well i f there,36
NA,w ere a recognised rule in regard to the,36
NA,r,36
NA,way i n which removals should be regulated.,36
NA,I n the State of South Australia men are,36
NA,"kept in tlie far North for years and years,",36
NA,and i t is impossible for them to get away.,36
NA,They live under conditions verydifferentfrom,36
NA,those which prevail i n other parts of that,36
NA,"I am very State, and i t seems to me that others in the",36
NA,public service ought to be prepared to share,36
NA,the burden of sucli unpleasant situations.,36
NA,If the honorable and learned member for,36
NA,"Tasmania, Mr Piesse, moves i n that direc-",36
NA,tion I shall support him.,36
Mr HUME COOK ,Bourke) - I woulcl,36
NA,suggest the reconsideration of the whole,36
NA,iii the clause. I n sub-clause (1) the commissioner,36
NA,has power to permit an officer to decline an,36
NA,offer of promotion or appointment without,36
NA,prejudice to liis right to future promotion,36
NA,or appointment. But i n sub-clause (2) an,36
NA,"absolute conflict takes place, and we give",36
NA,the Minister power to say to any particular,36
NA,"officer, "" I n spite of what the commissioner",36
NA,lias said you shall go to sucli and such a,36
NA,"place i f 1 choose, and i f you refuse, you",36
NA,"shall be dismissed."" I n any case the per-",36
NA,manent head has the right to order a man,36
NA,"about from place to place, and i f the",36
NA,"officer does not choose to go, i t is provided",36
NA,that he shall be dismissed. Perhaps the,36
NA,best thing to do would be to take the general,36
NA,powers given to the Minister under the term,36
NA,""" Governor-General,"" and say that if an",36
NA,officer refuses compliance with an order of,36
NA,"the Governor-General, he may be dismissed.",36
NA,I think that sub-clause (2) comes into serious,36
NA,conflict with sub-clause ( i ) .,36
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I do not want,36
NA,to insert any clause that is too drastic; but,36
NA,I do want the Governor-General or the Min-,37
NA,ister and commissioner to have power to,37
NA,compel the removal of an officer from one,37
NA,part oi the Commonwealth to another. That,37
NA,"power is absolutely necessary, and, i f i t is",37
NA,"not. conferred, we know perfectly well that",37
NA,no officer will go to a place like Port Dar-,37
NA,win. There must be a discretionary power,37
NA,.in the hands of some one. I admit that,37
NA,the matter is so important-seein g that we,37
NA,"are dealing now with a whole continent,",37
NA,possessing a diversity of chmate and condi-,37
NA,"tions-tbat , perhaps, this power should be",37
NA,i n the hands of the Governor-General. Then,37
NA,there would be the responsibility of the,37
NA,Government behind it. That would be pre-,37
NA,ferable to leaving i t i n the hands of the,37
NA,Minister or of the commissioner and the,37
NA,permanent head.,37
Mr HIGGINS ,Woul d tlie Minister insert,37

NA,"that all the words after ""Commonwealth,""- in",37

Mr MCCOLL ,Echuca) - Does that,37
NA,prevent the permanent head from moving,37

Mr ISAACS ,Indi) - I think i t is very,37
NA,arbitrary to provide that a meinber of,37
NA,the public service may bedismissed without,37
NA,any trial at all. I n the next clause we,37
NA,have a sort of code relating to dismissals,37
NA,and removals. That clause provides that,37
NA,[111],37
NA,"an officer may be tried, and i f found guilty",37
NA,that he shall be liable to certain punish-,37
NA,ment. I suggest to the Minister that tlie,37
NA,last sentence of sub-clause (2) of the clause,37
NA,now under discussion should be amended to,37
NA,read-,37
NA,Disregard of or disobedience to any such order,37
NA,shall be a breach of the provisions of this Act.,37
NA,Then the officer will be liable to be punished,37
NA,"according to the nature of his offence, but he",37
NA,will at least have an opportunity to defend,37
NA,himself.,37
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I f the honorable and,37

Mr HIGGINS ,Northern Melbourne) -,38
NA,I n dealing with offences involving,38
NA,"moval from the service, I would like to",38
NA,the Minister i f he has considered the,38
NA,diency of making insolvency a ground for,38
NA,the dismissal of an oflicer. We had sucli',38
NA,provision i n our Victorian law for a long,38
NA,"time, but six or seven years ago i t was altered",38
NA,because tliere were so many officers who had chief officer has no power bej ond that of,38
NA,landed themselves i n difficulties in connexion,38
NA,with the land boom. I am told that clause,38
NA,"56 deals with this matter, and I only want is carried entirely beyond him.",38
NA,to know whether Ministers have considered,38
NA,the question. Perhaps i t would be better,38
NA,with a to refer to the matter when we-get to clause,38
NA,forth56. That clause provides that i f an officer,38
NA,"he is unable to obtain his certificate, or is found",38
NA,"such to be guilty of extravagance or fraud, he",38
NA,"in may be dismissed, reduced, or reprimanded.",38
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLIAN , T h a t is f a i r,38
Mr HIGGINS , I would suggest some-,38
NA,such tliing more drastic because there is nothing,38
NA,more disheartening to a man i n his work,38
NA,than to feel that a great proportion of his,38
NA,"salary is to go away to others, and I tliink",38
NA,retlie King's service cannot be properly per-,38
NA,formed by men who are working to pay their,38
NA,creditors. I happen to know that there are,38
NA,inin the various States a very large number of,38
NA,and public servants who are going about with a,38
NA,"weight of debt around their necks, and some",38
NA,shall be of them with orders that they must pay a,38
NA,for inproportion of their salaries away every,38
NA,inmonth to satisfy their creditors. I will refer,38
NA,was susto this matter later on.,38
Mr HUME COOK ,I would like to know,38
NA,in if the Minister has considered any proposals,38
NA,of for the representation of employes on in-,38
NA,after fully quiry or appeal boards 1,38
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Tha t must be,38
NA,dealt witli i n a new clause. I was looking,38
NA,"are info the matter this afternoon, and I would",38
NA,then ask the honorable member to hold i t,38
NA,perover until a new clause has been prepared.,38
Mr MCCOLL ,Echuca) - I doubt very,38
NA,a much wliether this clause will be effective.,38
NA,accordI t seems to me that the draftsman has,38
NA,sucli simply adopted provisions which have been,38
NA,"or in force i n the various States, and has at-",38
NA,him to tempted ' to apply them to the circum-,38
NA,stances of tlie Commonwealth. The dealing,38
NA,"the with officers who have been guilty of offences,",38
NA,or will be very much more difficult under,38
NA,the circumstances of the Commonwealth ser-,38
NA,by the vice than would be the case i n one of the,38
NA,States. I n the case of the State service a,38
NA,man may be brought to head-quarters or,38
NA,the board of inquiry may be sent to the,38
NA,"replace where he is stationed, to make",38
NA,"ask inquiiy and deal with him on the spot,",38
NA,expebut when tlie large area of the Common-,38
NA,wealth has to be covered inquiry cannot,38
NA,a be conducted so readily. I see that this,38
NA,clause provides tliat a number of charges,38
NA,"may be brought against a man, but. that the",38
NA,T,38
NA,"reprimand . or caution, and the whole",38
NA,question whether a man is to be punished,38
NA,Tlie,38
NA,chief officer is the man who will really,38
NA,know more than any one else. He will be,39
NA,"the real working head of the department,",39
NA,because the permanent head will probably he,39
NA,"mostly i n attendance on the Minister, or",39
NA,engaged i n attending to the routine work of,39
NA,"the department, and will not come much i n",39
NA,contact with the oflieers. I f in every case,39
NA,the routine of a board of appeal has to be,39
NA,"gone through, there will be great delay and",39
NA,"enormous expense, and there will be fre-",39
NA,quent suspensions extending over long,39
NA,periods which will prove very costly i n so,39
NA,far as they will involve enforced idleness,39
NA,of officers on f u l l pay. I t seems to,39
NA,me that the chief officer ought to,39
NA,have more authority. I f a serious,39
NA,offence is committed he has to make a,39
NA,"report, and the matter will eventually come",39
NA,"before a board of inquiry, and after the",39
NA,board has completed its work i t is left,39
NA,to the permanent head to irerpose a,39
NA,"penalty, to the commissioner to reduce",39
NA,"the officer, or the Governor-General to dis-",39
NA,"miss him, as the nature of the case may",39
NA,require.,39
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I am,39
NA,to give the chief officer the power to fine up,39
NA,to a certain hmit.,39
Mr MCCOLL ,Tha t is what I was going,39
NA,"to suggest, because I think tliat otherwise",39
NA,many offences would be passed over without,39
NA,"any punishment, on account of the delay and",39
NA,trouble that would be involved i n bringing,39
NA,matters before a board of inquiiy.,39
NA,tliink that i f the chief officer has power to,39
NA,"fine, in man)' cases i t will meet tlie require-",39
NA,"ments very fairly, and certainly conduce to",39
NA,the discipline of tlie dei^ai-tment.,39
Mr TTJDOR ,Yarra) - I think that some,39
NA,provision should be made that where an officer,39
NA,"is charged with an offence, he should have",39
NA,the right to see copies of the correspondence,39
NA,which has passed between the various,39
NA,officers over him and the permanent head or,39
NA,"the appeal board. A t the present time,",39
NA,many officers are charged with offences,39
NA,about which* they are not able to learn any,39
NA,"particulars, and i t is quite possible for a",39
NA,man to have a charge worked up against,39
NA,him without knowing on what material i t,39
NA,is based. I t is not sufficient to give him a,39
NA,"copy of the charge, but he should also be",39
NA,furnished with a copy of tlie evidence,39
NA,against him.,39
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I f the honorable,39
NA,member allows the matter to stand,39
NA,over until the question of appeal has been omitted.,39
NA,"considered, we will deal with the point he",39
NA,"has mentioned, and I may be able to meet",39
NA,his views.,39
Mr POYNTON ,South Australia) - I,39
NA,understand that some medium course is pro-,39
NA,posed i n the way of allowing the chief,39
NA,"officer to inflict fines, but what possible",39
NA,chance will there be of securing the punish-,39
NA,"ment of any one, so long as the word "" ha-",39
NA,"bitually"" is allowed to remain i n the clause?",39
NA,AVhat would be a case of habitual drunk-,39
NA,"enness, and what would beacaseof habitual",39
NA,neglect of duty 1 Is there any necessity to,39
NA,have these words in. W i t h such words i n,39
NA,the clause i t would be difficult to prove even,39
NA,"one Cease, and I shall move to strike out. the",39
NA,"word ""habitually"" where i t occurs in the",39
NA,"clause, and to insert at the end of line 15,",39
NA,"the words "" t o such an extent as to impair",39
NA,"efficiency."" First of all I move-",39
NA,"That the word ""habitually,"" in line 8, he",39
NA,omitted.,39
Mr CROUCH ,Corio) - I would like to,39
NA,support the position taken up by the honorable,39
NA,"member for South Australia, Mr Poynton.",39
NA,"j'roposing The word "" habitual"" has been decided in our",39
NA,"courts of Yictoria, to have such a wide",39
NA,meaning that under the Marriage Act i t lias,39
NA,been decided that a man who gets drunk,39
NA,three times a week is not a habitual,39
NA,drunkard. I n dealing with these offences,39
NA,-tlie Ministry will have the strong support of,39
NA,every decent public servaut hecause the,39
NA,I general desire is that this clause should be,39
NA,thoroughly stiffened up. The retention of the,39
NA,"word "" habitually"" and other adverbs qualify-",39
NA,ing incompetence aiid negligence and irregu-,39
NA,larities will impair tlie usefulness of the pro-,39
NA,visions in the eyes of those public servants',39
NA,"who do theh duty conscientiously, and. who",39
NA,are desirous that those who are frequently,39
NA,negligent should be expelled froih the,39
NA,service.,39
. Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I do not object,39
NA,"to the striking out of the word "" habitually""",39
NA,which has no doubt been inserted by the,39
NA,draftsman. I think the clause will be,39
NA,quite effective without the word. The re-,39
NA,tention of the word would be undoubtedly,39
NA,in favour of the employe and I do not object,39
NA,to matters being left more to the discretion,39
NA,of tlie commissioner.,39

Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ,Wha,40
NA,"legal definition of "" frequently"" ? AVhat",40
NA,credit would the honorajble and learned,40
NA,member expect a man to get ?,40
Mr CROUCH , I take i t tliat .the pro-,40
NA,vision is necessaiy. Any person who has,40
NA,experience of thS courts knows the way,40
NA,whicli a large number of public servants,40
NA,constantly refuse to pay their debts. The,40
NA,unfortunate position i n regard fco fche lot.,40
NA,creditors of pubhc servants is that the,40
NA,"Kin g cannot be garnisheed, consequently",40
NA,fche only way i n which one can get,40
NA,public servant is by means of a defraud,40
NA,summons. I know men i n the public,40
NA,service of Victorifi-an d I suppose i t is,40
NA,same i n other States-wh o have come up,40
NA,and acknowledged in their exaniination on,40
NA,a defraud summons that they have had i,40
NA,"eight or nine orders, every one meaning that",40
NA,the person was guilty of fraudulent conduct.,40
NA,A n order is made only because of work.,40
NA,"previous fraudulent conduct, for no one",40
NA,can have an order for imprisonment made,40
NA,"against him now, except on the ground of",40
NA,fraud. I t is a disgraceful state of,40
NA,things to exist. Ifc means that tradesmen are proposal.,40
NA,defrauded. Decent public servants do not,40
NA,"want this state of things to continue, beagree to it.",40
NA,cause they have extra work imposed urjon.,40
NA,tliem by the otlier men attending the courts.,40
NA,I t is a constant scandal . i n the public,40
NA,partments that some men do frequently vision to put in.,40
NA,neglect to pay their debts. I feel that I,40
NA,am on proper lines because I was asked last,40
NA,night by a number of public servants,40
NA,propose such a provision. I m o v e -,40

Mr MAHON ,Coolgardie) -Be?OYe-th e mittee divided-,40

NA,Minister whether he cannot see his way to,40
NA,make the matter a little clearer.,40
NA,heard of men habituolfy using intoxicating,40
NA,liquor to excess.,40
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , W e struck out the,40

Mr MAHON ,"Doe s that mean a man Cook, Mr Hume",40

NA,t is the should this be an offence 1,40
An HONOURABLE MEMBER ,Th e question,40
NA,is not when he begins but when he leaves,40
NA,off.,40
Mr MAHON , I t is not a question of,40
NA,when he begins or when he leaves off. I t is,40
NA,i n simply a question of whether a man's work,40
NA,is affected by tlie liquor he takes.,40
Mr BATCHELOR ,Som e men can take a,40
Mr M AHON ,AA e all I suppose have,40
NA,r,40
NA,our experience i n that respect. AVe know,40
NA,at a how far indulgence -affects our work;,40
NA,but what I would suggest is that we,40
NA,should not make i t a penal offence for a man,40
NA,the to take a glass of liquor after office hours,40
NA,even i f i t does go to his head. I would sug-,40

Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Yes .,41

NA,"William pointed, unless possibly i t may be the desire",41
NA,on the part of those i n authority to have,41

Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I think i t,41
NA,better to provide that there shall not be less,41
NA,"than three members of the board, so as to",41

Mr HUME COOK ,Ar e three members,41
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I do not think,41

NA,a matter for the discretion of the chief,41

NA,quite certain that tlie employes would have,41
NA,a representative among a number on the,41

NA,individual.,41
Mr SALMON ,Laanecoorie) -Tha t is,41
NA,the very reason I object tff the number of,41
NA,three being exceeded. I t was my intention,41
NA,to move later on that employes should be,41
NA,represented when a charge was made,41
NA,"62, against one of their number, but i t would",41
NA,be futile to appoint one of the employes of,41

NA,the completely swamped by adding a number of,41

Mr HUME COOK ,Bourke) - I hope,41
NA,all the Minister will not press this amendment,41
NA,"to a division. I f he does, and the amend-",42
NA,"ment he carried, the representation of the",42

NA,that the representation of the employes on,42

Sir WILLIAM LYNE , N o r i n New South,42

Mr BATCHELOR , I should like to,42
NA,Comhear honorable members' experience as to,42
NA,the how the provision works. I t seems to me,42
NA,that the man who is well enough off to employ,42
NA,the best lawyer has the advantage.,42
Mr MCCAY , A man may be represented,42
NA,by an agent.,42
Mr BATCHELOR ,Suppos e the honor-,42
NA,"able, learned, and gallant member for Cori-",42
NA,is nella appeared on one side and some agent,42
NA,"on the other, what chance would there be",42
Sir WIELIAMLYNE , A similar provision,42
NA,"been working i n three States, and. I",42
NA,would ask the honorable member for South,42
NA,secured Australia to let this clause pass.,42
Mr BATCHELOR , I f honorable mem-,42
NA,bers who have had experience can assure me,42
NA,this provision works well i n practice I will,42
NA,I understand go no furtlier.,42
NA,Sir WILLIAM LYNE;-Ther e is no objec-,42
Mr RONALD ,Southern Melbourne) -,42
NA,can assure honorable members that this,42
NA,provision does not work well. I t causes,42
NA,"and serious expense to men employed, on the",42
NA,railways who are charged with trifling,42
NA,offences and who have to employ an agent.,42
NA,Mv. DEAKIN - I t is optional.,43
Mr BONALD ,Exactl y j but when a,43
NA,man knows he is going to be opposed by,43
NA,"an agent on the other side, i t is not optional.",43
NA,Cases are never decided on their moral,43
NA,"merits, but on the mere fact that one side",43
NA,is not represented or not well represented.,43
NA,I hope the provision will be struck out.,43
Mr MAUGER ,Melbourne Ports) - I,43
NA,take a different view from that of the,43
NA,"honorable member for Southern Melbourne,",43
NA,and I take that view after some experience.,43
NA,I know two or three public servants whom,43
NA,the very charge against them has so unstrung,43
NA,"that they were utterly unfitted to appear,",43
NA,and I am quite sure that those cases would,43
NA,have had a different termination i f they had,43
NA,not been allowed to employ representatives.,43
NA,I have i u my mind the case of a young man,43
NA,who was completely exonerated on the,43
NA,"charge made, against him, but who, had he",43
NA,"been dependent on his own resources, would",43
NA,have got into trouble. This is a very wise,43
NA,"provision, decidedly of advantage to officers",43
NA,against whom charges may be made.,43
Mr PAGE ,Maranoa) - I can corrobo-,43
NA,rate the remarks of the honorable member,43
NA,for Melbourne Ports. I n Queensland tliere,43
NA,was a case somewhat similar to tliose cited by,43
NA,the honorable member. Had the man not,43
NA,been allowed to get legal advice and have an,43
NA,"agent to attend for him, I am sure he would",43
NA,have lost his case; but he was completely,43
NA,exonerated when the case was put i n a,43
NA,"proper light. Eor tliat reason, I think the",43
NA,"honorable meinber for South Australia, Mr.",43
NA,"Batchelor, ought to withdraw any opposition",43
NA,he may have to the clause. I n everyday,43
NA,"hfe, i f a man had to defend himself from",43
NA,"charges made against him, he would find",43
NA,"himself i n "" Queer-street"" very often;",43
NA,whereas even with only an agent to defend,43
NA,"him, he may come off with flying colours.",43
Mr SALMON ,Laanecoorie) - I hope,43
NA,"the honorable member for South Australia,",43
NA,"Mr Batchelor, will withdraw his opposition.",43
NA,I can assure him from personal experi-,43
NA,ence that many a man against whom,43
NA,charges were made has had to go down,43
NA,but for the advice and assistance re-,43
NA,ceived from those who were able to,43
NA,put the cases as they should be put.,43
NA,I speak now on behalf of the members of,43
NA,"the legal profession, not one of whom has",43
NA,addressed himself to this clause. I t is the,43
NA,first clause tliat has escaped their attention.,43
NA,"I t is entirely owing to their, unselfish con-",43
NA,duct that they have been prevented from,43
NA,telling honorable members of many in-,43
NA,"stances i n which, to their own personal",43
NA,"knowledge, great harm would have resulted",43
NA,to men through improper action on the,43
NA,part of their superiors had i t not been for,43
NA,the assistance rendered by the lawyers.,43
Mr TUDOR ,Yarra) -I n the light of,43
NA,the.evidence tliat has just been given us I,43
NA,tliink tliat the clause should go further. I,43
NA,hope that tlie honorable member for South,43
NA,"Australia, Mr Batchelor, will withdraw his",43
NA,"opposition, and that we shall provide not",43
NA,only that officers shall have the right to be,43
NA,"represented by counsel, but that the State",43
NA,shall provide the counsel to represene,43
NA,them. I f there is a danger tliat an innocent,43
NA,man may go under unless he has the,43
NA,"benefit of being represented by counsel, I",43
NA,think that the question of money ought not,43
NA,- to stand i n the way. I f i t is right to have,43
NA,"counsel, then the State should pay for i t .",43
NA,We should have a State defender.,43
Mr WILKINSON ,Moreton) - I have,43
NA,had some little experience i n regard to this,43
NA,"matter. I n fact, I have appeared as an",43
NA,agent myself. Not only is i t good for,43
NA,pubhc servants to have counsel appeal for 1,43
NA,"them, but the fact that counsel is so ap-",43
NA,pearing acts as a controlling influence upon,43
NA,the board of inquiiy. Within the last,43
NA,"three months I was asked to appear, on",43
NA,"behalf of one public servant, i n the State",43
NA,"of Queensland, and I know that the very",43
NA,fact that I had been nominated had the,43
NA,effect of causing a very much closer in-,43
NA,vestigation to be held than would otherwise,43
NA,have been tlie case. I would like to see,43
NA,the right given to any accused pubhc ser-,43
NA,vants to see the evidence of all those,43
NA,who are supporting the charge against him.,43
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , The honorable,43
NA,member will recollect that there is one of,43
NA,"the public servants on the Appeal Board,",43
NA,who will see all the evidence.,43
Mr MAUGER ,Does the Minister not,43
NA,think that tlie evidence should be supphed 1,43
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I do not think so.,43
Mr WILKINSON , I t is a very diffi-,43
NA,cult matter i n many cases to get at the evi-,43
NA,dence that has been supplied. The plea,43
NA,generally put forward is that i t forms,43
NA,part of official documents. But where a,43
NA,"man's position is jeopardized, I think he",43
NA,has a right to know everything that has,43
NA,"been mentioned against him. The clause,",43
NA,"as far as i t goes, is an admirable one, and",43
NA,I hope the honorable member for South,43
NA,"Australia, Mr Batchelor, will withdraw his",44
NA,opposition to i t .,44
Mr MCCAY ,Corinella) - I heartily in-,44
NA,dorse what has been said by the honorable,44
NA,member for Moreton with regard to the,44
NA,right of an accused puhlic servant to know,44
NA,what evidence is being brought against liim.,44
NA,I n all our criminal courts there is either a,44
NA,"preliminary inquiiy, at which the accused",44
NA,"learns the character of the evidence, or else",44
NA,"he is told what witnesses are to be called,",44
NA,and what they are to attempt to prove. TJie,44
NA,object of all systems of procedure i n civil,44
NA,cases is to let the parties come to an,44
NA,"issue, and have a general idea of each",44
NA,other's case. To put a public servant,44
NA,in the position of being told that he is,44
NA,charged with liaving committed a certain,44
NA,"offence, and of liaving to come before the",44
NA,board knowing nothing of tlie circum-,44
NA,stances-whe n tlie words of the charge may,44
NA,be wide enough to cover a score of sets of,44
NA,circu instances-i s to treat him i n a veiy,44
NA,unfair manner. He should be entitled,44
NA,to know not only what the technical,44
NA,"words of the charge' are, but something",44
NA,"more. ' Eor example, let us suppose that an",44
NA,officer is charged under clause 40 with being,44
NA,habitually negligent in the discharge of his,44
NA,duties. How can he know what he has to,44
NA,meet under those words ? They may cover,44
NA,"the whole term of his service, or they may",44
NA,"refer to some act that he has committed, or",44
NA,to something which he bas neglected to do.,44
NA,I n all fairness an officer is entitled to know,44
NA,the circu instances which constitute the,44
NA,"general accusation brought against him, and",44
NA,therefore he ought to have some reasonable,44
NA,knowledge of the facte that are alleged,44
NA,against him i n order that he may be pre-,44
NA,pared to meet them. A man may be charged,44
NA,"with doing a certain thing, and may be able",44
NA,"to call evidence to show that he did not do i t ,",44
NA,but he might not be able to call that evidence,44
NA,unless he knew beforehand what the charge,44
NA,was. I ask the Minister to think over this,44
NA,matter. On further consideration I am sure,44
NA,he will find that my suggestion is only con-,44
NA,sonant with the principles of fahplay which,44
NA,we find throughout the whole of our law.,44
Mr E SOLOMON ,Eremantle) - I hope,44
NA,that the honorable member for South Aus-,44
NA,tralia will withdraw his opposition to the,44
NA,"clause, because i t seems to me to be only",44
NA,just that an officer against whom a charge,44
NA,is made should have the right to be,44
NA,represented by counsel. There might be,44
NA,"technicalities in an Act which the officer, as",44
NA,"a layman, would not understand, and which",44
NA,would need the services of a lawyer or some,44
NA,educated man to unravel. I also think that,44
NA,there may be a certain amount of timidity,44
NA,on the part of an officer if he is called upon,44
NA,to appear personally before a board to give,44
NA,evidence i n such an inquiiy.,44
Mr BATCHELOR ,South Australia) -,44
NA,After the overwhelming evidence offered by,44
NA,"the non-legal members of the House, regard-",44
NA,ing this practice' of allowing accused persons,44
NA,"to be represented by counsel, I must cer-",44
NA,"tainly bow to their desire, and withdraw all",44
NA,opposition to the proposal.,44
Mr CROUCH ,Corio) - I purposely,44
NA,waited t i l l this matter had been discussed,44
NA,in order that I might suggest to the Minister,44
NA,the desirability of allowing any officer who,44
NA,is charged with an offence to have the in-,44
NA,quiry conducted privately. I do not know,44
NA,whether the Minister will consent to that.,44
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I f we are going to,44
NA,load tlie Bill up witli all sorts of twopenny-,44
NA,halfpenny matters i t will break down.,44
Mr CROUCH , I do not think that,44
NA,i t will break down. I believe i n pub-,44
NA,"hcity, but there are occasions when a",44
NA,man would be condemned by a report,44
NA,appearing in the press. He should have the',44
NA,right to demand that the inquiiy shall be,44
NA,"conducted i n private, i n which case the",44
NA,result only need be given to the world.,44
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I thinkthat,44
NA,might be done under regulations. But I,44
NA,would point out to the honorable and,44
NA,learned member that i t is sometimes abso-,44
NA,lutely essential'that an inquiry should be,44
NA,conducted i n public for the sake of,44
NA,tbe department. To give the right,44
NA,to an accused public servant to de-,44
NA,mand that the inquiiy shall be held,44
NA,privately is not quite the proper thing. I,44
NA,"admit that there' might be regulations,",44
NA,framed to allow of such an mquiry being,44
NA,held i n private i f the commissioner or,44
NA,Minister agreed to that course being adopted.,44
NA,But i t would not be wise to give an absolute,44
NA,right to the accused to say that the inquiry,44
NA,should not be open to the press.,44
Mr ISAACS , I n d i ) - I tliink that the,44
NA,Minister for Home'Affairs has taken the,44
NA,correct stand. We must not forget that these',44
NA,"are public affairs, and that the public have a",44
NA,right to know what is being done i n regard,44
NA,to their own business. There may be cases,44
NA,"which, from other considerations, ought",44
NA,to be conducted i n private. I t may be well,44
NA,that - power should be given to have,44
NA,inquiries conducted in private by the consent,45
NA,"of all parties interested, but to lay down",45
NA,the rule that an officer may demand an,45
NA,inquiry i n private would be to overlook,45
NA,the fact that we are dealing with public,45
NA,concerns.,45
Mr SOLMON ,Laanecoorie) - I under-,45
NA,stand that the desire of tlie honorable and,45
NA,learned member for Corio is to protect an,45
NA,officer i n the public service against whom,45
NA,"an offence is alleged, from suffering from",45
NA,revelations that might be made out-,45
NA,side of that service. The officer might be,45
NA,"exonerated within the service, but the very",45
NA,fact of a charge having been levelled against,45
NA,hun might militate against his standing out-,45
NA,side. I n cases of that sort there is no diffiprivate.,45
NA,culty at all with the press. The press have,45
NA,always shown themselves prepared to act,45
NA,with discretion on such occasions.,45
Mr RONALD ,Oh !,45
Mr SALMON ,Tha t is my experience,45
NA,at any rate.,45
Mr RONALD ,-I t is not the experience of,45
NA,any one else.,45
Mr SALMON ,Ther e are plenty of mem-,45
NA,bers of this House who know that that is their,45
NA,experience. Where a man has been im-,45
NA,properly charged with an offence and found,45
NA,innocent i t is veiy easy indeed to take mea-,45
NA,sures to prevent the publication of the pro-,45
NA,ceedings i f he so desires. On the other,45
NA,"hand there is a large number of cases, which",45
NA,as the honorable and learned member for,45
NA,"I n di has pointed out, should be inquired",45
NA,into in public. The matters involved are,45
NA,"of a public - character, and i t is - right",45
NA,tliat the public should have an oppor-,45
NA,tunity of judging. The fact of the public,45
NA,being given that opportunity would also,45
NA,act i n such a way as to protect the,45
NA,officer charged. I t would do away with,45
NA,the star-chamber business. I n the past,45
NA,there has been too much of private' reports,45
NA,in the public service. When I entered tlie,45
NA,"Education department in Melbourne, I found",45
NA,that there was the principle of secret reports,45
NA,"by inspectors, which reports the employes",45
NA,were never allowed to see except - when a,45
NA,"charge was made against them, and then",45
NA,only by applying to the Public Service Board.,45
NA,This system was carried out under regula-,45
NA,"tions, and has since been abolished. Some of",45
NA,the officers after its abolition unearthed,45
NA,reports about themselves of years' standing-,45
NA,reports of which they knew nothing. There,45
NA,is always a great danger to the public service,45
NA,"in having private reports given, and I think",45
NA,that the honorable member will be well,45
NA,advised i f he withdraws his amendment.,45
Mr TUDOR ,Yarra) - I beheve i n the,45
NA,whole of the public service administration,45
NA,being conducted in the open. There should be,45
NA,"no secret reports, and I believe that all in-",45
NA,quiries should be open to the press. I f an,45
NA,honorable member argues that these inquiries,45
NA,"should be open to the press and the public, -",45
NA,surely i t is not consistent to afterwards',45
NA,say that any officer has a right to a report,45
NA,which can i n any way be regarded as confi-,45
NA,dential. I f tun officer has a right to say that,45
NA,certain proceedings shall be regarded as pri-,45
NA,"vateand confidential, then the accused person",45
NA,has a right to say that the inquiiy should be,45
NA,I n laying down the principle that,45
NA,these inquiries shall be open to the press,45
NA,"and public, we also adopt the principle that",45
NA,the reports i n reference to the charge should,45
NA,"be accessible to the accused, so that he may",45
NA,be able to see what is alleged against him.,45
NA,The honorable member for Laanecoorie has,45
NA,referred to secret reports. There was a case,45
NA,recently in which a man was tried. ' Fortu-,45
NA,"tunately he got off, but tliere is no knowing",45
NA,"whether, if a private and confidential report",45
NA,"had gone i n against him, he would not have",45
NA,been judged upon i t . I am in favour of,45
NA,these inquiries being conducted openly.,45
' Mr KIRWAN ,Kalgoorlie) - I would,45
NA,hke the Minister i n charge of the Bill to,45
NA,consider the desirableness of making some,45
NA,provision whereby an officer wrongfully,45
NA,charged should be allowed any expenses tliat,45
NA,he might incur. I t is possible to conceive,45
NA,of a case i n which an officer might be put,45
NA,to considerable expense i n defending him-,45
NA,"self, and I think that i t would bo a grave",45
NA,injustice i f he were not to be allowed his,45
NA,traveUing and other expenses.,45
Mr OMALLEY ,Tasmania) -I t has,45
NA,often occurred that a man has been brought,45
NA,"before a board of inquiry, and although he",45
NA,has not been completely condemned he has,45
NA,been virtually condemned i n the service for,45
NA,"some time to come, and i t therefore seems",45
NA,to me that the Government ought to provide,45
NA,officers with counsel to assist them i n defend-,45
NA,ing themselves. I f the}' will not do that,45
NA,they ought to agree if the officer is acquitted,45
NA,to pay the expenses connected with his,45
NA,defence.,45
Mr HIGGINS ,I f the officer is convicted',45
NA,I suppose he should pay.,45
Mr OMALLEY , I f the officer is con-,45
NA,victed he will have to clear.,45
Mr HIGGINS ,The n he would,46
NA,nothing.,46
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Doe s not the honthe,46
NA,orable member think that matter might be,46
NA,"left to the recommendation of the commisnity,",46
NA,sioner and then to the Minister ? I have,46
NA,"had hundreds of cases in New South Wales, wish to do so.",46
NA,and I have never refused to pay the ex-,46
NA,penses where a person has been improperly,46
NA,-charged.,46
Mr OMALLEY , I f I were sure that,46
NA,the Minister for Home Affairs would be the,46
NA,deciding authority I would not hesitate for,46
NA,"one moment, but whilst I have faith i n",46
NA,men I have none i n others. AVe have,46
NA,experience of what may be done i n some,46
NA,cases with a man when he is i n a helpless,46
NA,"position, and we know that some people",46
NA,think that the right time to kick a man,46
NA,when he is down. We ought to do someI,46
NA,thing to help civil servants when they,46
NA,"in trouble, because tliey have not much",46
NA,money as a rule. I f the honorable member,46
NA,for Kalgoorlie will move on the lines I have,46
NA,"indicated, I will support him.",46
Mr MAHON ,Coolgardie) -I n view of,46
NA,the fact that a civil servant i n some remote,46
NA,part of' the Commonwealth might be importance,46
NA,summoned before a board i n Melbourne or,46
NA,"Sydney, then undoubtedly, i f he be found",46
NA,guiltless of a malicious charge lodged,46
NA,"against him by a superior officer, he ought",46
NA,should receive some compensation for his,46
NA,expenses.' I hope tlie Minister will take,46
NA,"a favourable view of this matter, because",46
NA,is quite possible for the head of the departaccused,46
NA,ment or a chief officer occasionally to have,46
NA,"a prejudice against a man, and even to go",46
NA,far as to lay a charge against him. W i t,46
NA,regard to tlie proposal that these inquiries,46
NA,"should be held with .open doors, I am not",46
NA,"inclined to * support that view, because cases",46
NA,we know very well that the sensacence,46
NA,tional newspapers will have their reabroad;,46
NA,porters at such boards of inquiry; and,46
NA,i f an officer should be charged with,46
NA,"disgraceful or improper conduct the evienemies,",46
NA,dence will go forth day by day to the,46
NA,"public, and give malicious and - vindictive",46
NA,people an opportunity to come forward.,46
NA,I n cases of this kind evidence could be with an open inquiry.,46
NA,manufactured against civil servants which,46
NA,should not be admitted at such inquiries.,46
NA,"I f a man is to be tried, he should be tried",46
NA,upon what the head of the department is,46
NA,"able to prove, and there should be no",46
NA,fishing inquiriesor any encouragement offered,46
NA,"pay to private enemies, who may be only too",46
NA,glad to take a man's character away. I n,46
NA,interests of the public servants them-,46
NA,"selves, and i n the interests of the commu-",46
NA,we should give the board the power to,46
NA,"hold these investigations i n private, i f they",46
Mr RONA LD ,Southern Melbourne) -,46
NA,I think that in considering this matter we,46
NA,have to remember that a man may be called,46
NA,upon to answer an accumulation of trifling,46
NA,charges which may represent the failings of,46
NA,"years, and that i t may be extremely difficult",46
NA,"for him to sift the charges to tlie bottom,",46
NA,some and to meet the evidence brought against,46
NA,"had him, unless he is furnished .with an",46
NA,epitome of i t . W i t h regard to recoup-,46
NA,ing officers the expenses which they have,46
NA,incurred i n defending themselves against,46
NA,"is charges which have not been estabhshed,",46
NA,think i t would be only fair to make,46
NA,"are some provision of tliat sort. Moreover,",46
NA,i t would offer some guarantee against,46
NA,"trivial charges being brought against officers,",46
NA,because i f the expenses had to be paid i t,46
NA,would make the heads of departments more,46
NA,careful in bringing charges against their,46
NA,subordinates. These two points are of vital,46
NA,as far as the civil servants are,46
NA,"concerned, and I hope the Government will",46
NA,see that provision is made for them. I n the,46
NA,event of an officer being found guilty i t,46
NA,to be provided that he should bear the,46
NA,expense himself. I think that the inquiries,46
NA,"should be quite open and above board, re-",46
NA,"i t serving, however, the right to the person",46
NA,to exercise his option as to whether,46
NA,the inquiry shall be held i n public or i n,46
NA,so private. We have the same alternative i n,46
NA,"h courts of which I have had some experience,",46
NA,and we have found i t an admirable pro-,46
NA,vision. Some men may elect to have their,46
NA,tried in public in order that their inno-,46
NA,may be established and proclaimed,46
NA,whilst others of a more sensitive,46
NA,-character may prefer to have the inquiry,46
NA,conducted i n private. Every man has his,46
NA,and some persons are always ready,46
NA,to come forward and vent their spleen,46
NA,"against others, and thus there is a",46
NA,certain amount of danger i n connexion,46
NA,"Then, again,",46
NA,there is the danger of unjustifiable,46
NA,comment i n the newspapers. AVe had a,46
NA,very good illustration of the disadvantages,46
NA,of this i n connexion with a recent case of,46
NA,breach of privilege arising out of comments,46
NA,upon a case which was sub judice. I f that,46
NA,matter had not been made public that case,47
NA,"- ""would never have happened.",47
Mr HIGGINS ,Northern Melbourne) -,47
NA,There are three points that become very,47
NA,important i n order that justice may,47
NA,"be secured in connexion with these' in-,",47
NA,quiries. So far as the publicity of the,47
NA,"inquiries goes, my experience is that i n",47
NA,99 cases out of 100 i t is far better to have,47
NA,"publicity, and the only restriction that has",47
NA,been found useful is the discretion given to,47
NA,Judges to order that there shall be no publi-,47
NA,cation of the evidence. I think this or,47
NA,a similar power might be given to the board,47
NA,of inquiry.,47
Mr DEAKIN ,Tha t is what we propose,47
NA,under regulations.,47
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I have an objection,47
NA,to give tlie option to the individual to say,47
NA,"that the inquiiy shall be private, but I have",47
NA,no objection to giving the discretion to the,47
NA,hoard.,47
Mr HIGGINS , I do not,47
NA,"he right to give the option to the individual,",47
NA,because i f i t is i n the interests of the com-,47
NA,"munity that there should be publicity,",47
NA,"quiry should be held i n public, notwithstandintend",47
NA,ing the feelings of the individual concerned.,47
NA,I strongly support the proposal that the,47
NA,accused person should be supplied with aU,47
NA,reports relating to his conduct.,47
NA,by sub-clause (2) the oflicer is to be,47
NA,"with a copy of -the charge, but i n addition",47
NA,to that he ought to know on what material,47
NA,"those who are acting, against him",47
NA,and he ought to be put i n the same position,47
NA,so far as knowledge is concerned as his,47
NA,accusers. I think i t would he well i f the,47
NA,board had power to issue a certificate as,47
NA,what costs and expenses should be allowed,47
NA,i n connexion with any cases brought before,47
NA,them. I can understand that there are,47
NA,some cases i n which a man ought to pay,47
NA,some of the expenses to which he has put,47
NA,"Crown, and on the other hand there are cases",47
NA,i n wliich i t would be egregiously unfair,47
NA,to put a civil servant to the expense o'f,47
NA,bringing witnesses from the far parts of,47
NA,the Commonwealth without aUowing him,47
NA,one penny towards his expenses. I t would,47
NA,answer the purpose if the Minister,47
NA,provide that the board might certify what,47
NA,costs and expenses should be allowed.,47
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Coul d i t not be put,47
NA,"in. this way, that the board should recomthat",47
NA,"mend, not that they should absolutely",47
NA,decide.,47
Mr HIGGINS , I propose that tliey,47
NA,should certify and leave i t to the Minister,47
NA,to allow the costs certified to i f he thinks,47
NA,desirable.,47
'* Mr ISAACS ,Indi) -Wit h regard to the,47
NA,"expenses of an exonerated officer, I think",47
NA,that power should be given under the,47
NA,B i l l to allow him all reasonable expenses.,47
NA,A man may be caUed upon to defend his,47
NA,whole life i n connexion with tlie charge,47
NA,"against him, and the more sure he is of his in-",47
NA,nocence the greater expense he may have to,47
NA,incur. I t is suggested that officers may be,47
NA,brought from one end of the continent to,47
NA,the other i n order that their conduct may he,47
NA,"inquired into, but I hope that nothing of",47
NA,"that kind wiU happen, but that we shall",47
NA,have local boards of inquiiy who will be,47
NA,able to obviate the necessity for bringing,47
NA,officers from long distances. A n officer,47
NA,who is dragged away from a remote,47
NA,part of the continent down to Sydney or,47
NA,Melbourne might -not be able to bring his,47
NA,think i t would witnesses with him.,47
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I f the honorable,47
NA,the inmember will allow this clause to pass I,47
NA,to submit provisions dealing with the,47
NA,three matters that have heen referred to.,47
Mr KIRWAN ,Kalgoorlie) - I tliink,47
NA,the that the Minister might let the committee,47
NA,I see that know whether he is going to do anything i n,47
NA,supplied regard to tlie question of expenses.,47
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I did so.,47
Mr KIRWAN , W e did not hear the,47
NA,"are working, honorable member say so.",47
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Ther e are three,47
NA,"points which have been referred to. First,",47
NA,there is the regulation that the board on ap-,47
NA,to lication can hold an inquiry in private. I,47
NA,propose to leave i t to their discretion.,47
NA,There may be reasons why i t should be held,47
NA,"privately, but no oflicer can demand a",47
NA,"private inquiry. Then, i n reference to the",47
NA,"the expenses, I propose that the board can",47
NA,recommend as to expenses and certify; they,47
NA,"cannot decide, but they can recommend.",47
Mr MAHON ,Who pays the expenses 1,47
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Th e board may,47
NA,make a recommendation i f they recommend,47
NA,were to at aU against the individual.,47
Mr MAHON ,Against tlie individual who,47
NA,laid the charge 1,47
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , N o ; I presume,47
NA,7,47
NA,where the expenses are paid i n the,47
NA,interests of the official they would be paid,47
NA,by the Government.,47
Mr MAHON ,Wher e the official lays the,48
NA,charge the Government pay the expenses ?,48
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Wher e the,48
NA,"official laid the charge, they could make any",48
NA,recommendation; hut I take i t that the,48
NA,practical working of this prpvision would be,48
NA,that if there was an inquiry held on a,48
NA,"charge by an official, and, if i t was proved",48
NA,that i t was a vicious or an improper charge to,48
NA,"make, the board would certify as to ex-",48
NA,"penses against the accuser or, if he could not",48
NA,"pay, the Government would have to indem-",48
NA,nify the employe. Suppose i t came out in,48
NA,evidence that an official made an improper,48
NA,charge,48
Mr A MCLEAN ,Bu t the board would,48
NA,not be likely to recommend costs against,48
NA,him.,48
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Tha t would be,48
NA,a matter for the department to deal with.,48
NA,Veiy likely the board would certify that,48
NA,the charge should not have been made at,48
NA,all.,48
Mr SALMON ,"I f so, then an official could",48
NA,be proceeded against under the first part of,48
NA,clause 40 for improper conduct: but surely,48
NA,the Minister would not penalize a man by,48
NA,asking liim to pay the costs of the inquiiy ?,48
NA,Very few officials would undertake to bring,48
NA,a charge i f that were done.,48
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I n the practical,48
NA,working of the provision I take i t that the,48
NA,department would have to indemnify the,48
NA,official.,48
Mr FOWLEH ,But the honorable member,48
NA,would not penalize the official who brought,48
NA,the charge 1,48
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I t would de-,48
NA,pend entirely upon whether i t was shown,48
NA,"that he should not have brought the charge,",48
NA,and that he had acted in a vicious manner.,48
NA,I f i t was done in the execution of his,48
NA,duty he ought to be protected; but if i t,48
NA,"was done, as has been done in some cases,",48
NA,"from a vicious motive, he ought to suffer",48
NA,"for it, ancl that would be a matter for the",48
NA,board to deal with.,48
Mr MCCAY , I t is a much more serious,48
NA,thing than the mere mulcting him i n costs.,48
Mr ISAACS ,H e would have to.be tried,48
NA,first if he made a vicious charge.,48
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Quit e so. W i t h,48
NA,reference to giving a copy of the charge,48
NA,"and the evidence, or any document referring",48
NA,"to the charge, i t seems to me there is a",48
NA,good deal of reason in asking that an em-,48
NA,ploye shall get i t if he requires i t . I want,48
NA,honorable members to allow these three,48
NA,matters to remain in abeyance until I get a,48
NA,new sub-clause drafted to deal with them.,48
Mr ISAACS ,Indi) -I n connexion with,48
NA,"reports being produced to an accused officer,",48
NA,a great distinction ought to be drawn be-,48
NA,tween the classes of reports. I f they are,48
NA,reports which have to be used against the,48
NA,"accused, of course he ought to see them;",48
NA,but i f they are confidential communications,48
NA,between the Minister and any officer of the,48
NA,"department, and are not going to be used",48
NA,"against the accused, i t would be a",48
NA,dangerous thing that any communication,48
NA,which was made confidentially by an offi-,48
NA,"cial to his Minister, at the Minister's re-",48
NA,"quest i t may be, should be unnecessarily",48
NA,made public. I t would be most detrimental,48
NA,to the proper carrying on of the department.,48
NA,But I quite agree that any document which,48
NA,is to be used against an officer should he,48
NA,made available to him.,48
Mr MCCAY ,Tha t is all any of us,48
NA,want.,48
Mr ISAACS , That is all that is,48
NA,wanted. There isone little thing in the matter,48
NA,of drafting to be mentioned. Tliere is pro-,48
NA,vision made that the Board of Inquiry is,48
NA,to consist of tliree persons. One is to be the,48
NA,"chairman, and any two of them are em-",48
NA,powered to exercise the powers of the,48
NA,board. These two may not include tlie,48
NA,chairman. Under clause 10 the chair-,48
NA,man is to have the same powers,48
NA,"as the commissioner or inspector, which",48
NA,will include the power to administer an,48
NA,oath. I t is only the chairman who has,48
NA,"tliat power, and if by any chance he should",48
NA,"be absent, I tliink i t will be found that there",48
NA,is no power to administer the oath. The Acts,48
NA,"Interpretation Bill, i f i t is passed in its",48
NA,"present form, will provide i n clause 35 that",48
NA,certain tribunals which have power to hear,48
NA,and determine matters may administer an,48
NA,oath. The board has no power to do any-,48
NA,thing but to form an opinion and report.,48
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I think there,48
NA,is a good deal in what thehonorable and,48
NA,learned member has said. I should like,48
NA,to get the BiU pushed as far forward as,48
NA,possible to-night. We may not get through,48
NA,"with aU the new clauses, but I wish to get",48
NA,the BiU placed i n the hands of the printer.,48
NA,"I t will take some time to get the Bill, as",48
NA,"amended, printed. I want to place i t i n -",48
NA,the hands of honorable members before it. is,48
NA,"taken any further, so that they .can see the'",48
NA,effect of what has been done. I f there should,48
NA,be any matters which we have overlooked i n .,48

NA,r,49

NA,to the whole amount of premiums,49

NA,premiums on his policy ; and,49
NA,(ii) for the increasing from time to,49

Mr HUME COOK ,Bourke) - I desire,49
NA,at this stage to raise a question of,49
NA,"portance, and that is, whether we shall",49
NA,mit officers joining the Commonwealth,49
NA,vice to assure their lives under this clause,49
NA,"with any company they choose, or, asi",49
NA,may be amended at the instance of the,49
NA,"honorable member for Tasmania, Mr.",49
NA,"Piesse, with certain prescribed companies.",49
Mr DEAKIN , I t is proposed to put the,49
NA,"word ""approved"" before the words "" l i",49
NA,"assurance company.""",49
Mr HUME COOK ,Whethe r we should,49
NA,"accept that suggestion, or whether,",49
NA,"propose, the whole of the assurance",49
NA,business of those who come into the Comrevenue,49
NA,"monwealth service, should be transacted",49
NA,the Government--tha t is the question.,49
NA,"order to test the feeling of the committee,",49
NA,I move-,49
NA,"That after the word ""Act,"" line 1, the following",49
NA,"words be inserted:-""Ever y officer on the",49
NA,firmation of his appointment shall effect with,49
NA,Government of the Commonwealth an assurance,49
NA,"on his life, providing for the following benefits.""",49
NA,The clause will then go on to read just,49
NA,printed. A t this stage I do not propose,49
NA,say anything about the provisions of,49
NA,"clause as they stand, except to point",49
NA,that in the first place the Government,49
NA,"pose that every probationer, before the",49
NA,"firmation of his appointment, is to assure",49
NA,hfe. That seems to me to be playing into,49
NA,"[27 JUNE, 1901.] Bill. 1757",49
NA,'the hands of assurance companies to an,49
NA,"unnecessary degree, because if a man",49
NA,were not appointed he would haA'e been,49
NA,"compelled to take out a policy on his life,",49
NA,"which, perhaps, he would not have done had",49
NA,prohe known that he was not going to be per- -,49
NA,appointmanently appointed. I think that to be,49
Mr DEAKIN ,Th e point is that he must,49
NA,i t out before he is appointed. I t is -,49
NA,one of the conditions of the appointment;,49
NA,on his but he need not complete until he is as-,49
NA,he attains the sured of his appointment.,49
Mr HUME COOK ,Perhap s that may,49
NA,sixty cover the objection I have raised. I think,49
NA,i t would be unfair to compel a man to take,49
NA,from or out an assurance on his life unless there,49
NA,public was a reasonable chance of his being per-,49
NA,equal manently appointed. I am not quite sure,49
NA,paid whether the provisions in sub-clause (c),49
NA,unare possible of attainment at a l l ; but we,49
NA,"the must wait, I suppose, to hear what the",49
NA,time of Governinent have to say on this question.,49
NA,be preWhat I desire the committee to deter-,49
NA,mine is whether the Government are to,49
NA,carry on an assurance business or,49
NA,some imwhether we are to permit private,49
NA,"peror mutual companies, as has been the",49
NA,"sercase in the past, to do tlie assurance",49
NA,work of the civil service. I . think i t is,49
NA,t quite proper for the Government to propose,49
NA,to render i t compulsory for every servant,49
NA,joining the Commonwealtli service to take,49
NA,out an assurance on his life. The object of,49
NA,"that provision, of course, is to do away with",49
NA,f e the necessity of an old-age pension system,49
NA,such as we have been used to in some,49
NA,of the States. I think i t is a much,49
NA,as I better provision than the finding of a,49
NA,sum of money out of the consolidated,49
NA,for paying pensions to civil servants,49
NA,by when they retire; and to that extent I,49
NA,I n think the proposal for assurance is accept-,49
NA,able. Inasmuch as the Government pro-,49
NA,"pose, rightly I think, to make i t com-",49
NA,pulsory there ought to be some sort of,49
NA,conguarantee to those who are thus compelled,49
NA,the to assure their lives that the amounts for,49
NA,"which they are assured, or the annuities",49
NA,"which tliey hope to receive, shall be paid to",49
NA,"as i t is them. Luckily, over the whole of this",49
NA,to Commonwealth most of the assurance,49
NA,the companies doing any considerable business,49
NA,"out are conducted on the mutual principle, and",49
NA,proI do not recollect any company which has,49
NA,conever failed to meet its obligations. I must,49
NA,"his be fair to that extent. A t the same time,",49
NA,cases have occurred in other parts of tlie,49
NA,1758 Public Service [REPRESENTATIVES.],50
NA,world where companies have not kept their',50
NA,"engagements i n this regard, and where",50
NA,persons being assured with them have not,50
NA,received the benefits which they ought to,50
NA,have received had the companies been better,50
NA,"- managed financially. I feel, therefore, that",50
NA,the principle of compulsion on tlie part of,50
NA,the servant ought to involve the principle,50
NA,of guarantee on the part'of the Government.,50
NA,I f we compel a man to assure his hfe we,50
NA,Ought to guarantee him the benefits wliieh,50
NA,we insist he sluill take for himself as part of,50
NA,his service with the Commonwealth. This,50
NA,"principle is partly recognised i n clause 49,",50
NA,which says-,50
NA,"(1) Where a person is unable to assure his life,",50
NA,or is unable to assure his life without a loading,50
NA,"ot five years or more beiug made upon his age,",50
NA,and in such hitter case is unwilling to assure his,50
NA,"life, he shall not thereby be disqualified for ap-",50
NA,"pointment or promotion, but a prescribed deduc-",50
NA,tion shall be made at prescribed times from such,50
NA,person's salary.,50
NA,(2) Such deductions shall be invested and,50
NA,accumulated in the prescribed manner by the,50
NA,commissioner or some officer or authority ap-,50
NA,pointed for the purpose by the Governor-Gene-,50
NA,ral.,50
NA,That introduces the recognition on tlie part,50
NA,of the Government of theh liability to per-,50
NA,sons joining the service who cannot get any,50
NA,assurance to see that they get something,50
NA,like the same reward when they leave the,50
NA,service as those who can secure an assur-,50
NA,ance. Clauses 44 and 49 are therefore,50
NA,"intimately related, and the recognition of",50
NA,tlie principle I am contending for is to my,50
NA,mind to be seen in clause 49. The Govern-,50
NA,ment appear in tbat clause to accept some,50
NA,responsibility in tliis regard. It is pretty-,50
NA,well known tliat in otlier parts of the world,50
NA,this system has been adoptedI believe,50
NA,that in the Germanic Confederation there is,50
NA,a system of State assurance hi connexion,50
NA,with the civil serviee. I am not familiar,50
NA,"with its details, and I certainly do not know",50
NA,very much about its working; but I am,50
NA,"told, on tlie authority of tliose who have",50
NA,"learned a little more about it than I have,",50
NA,"that it works exceedingly well, and my own",50
NA,reading and knowledge on the subject go to,50
NA,prove also that it is extremely satisfactory to,50
NA,both the Government and the civil servants.,50
NA,The British public service has adopted,50
NA,"the principle of State annuities,",50
NA,I believe in much more firmly than I,50
NA,do in the payment of a lump sum.,50
NA,a man getting a lump sum on retirement,50
NA,may be tempted into some speculation or,50
NA,"business and lose, just when he requires",50
NA,Mr Hume Cool:,50
NA,BiM.,50
NA,them the whole of the savings which he f o r,50
NA,years has been anticipating to live on. As a,50
NA,"matter of fact, instances of that kind have",50
NA,occurred constantly in our own experience.,50
NA,We know men who have come into a fair,50
NA,"sum of nioney by way of assurance, and",50
NA,who have put that money into some-,50
NA,"business or speculation, and have been left",50
NA,-,50
NA,practically penniless i n the evening of their,50
NA,lives.,50
Mr OMALLEY ,Would the honorable,50
NA,member prevent assurers mortgaging their,50
NA,annuities 1,50
Mr HUME COOK , I would prevent,50
NA,them dealing with the annuities in any,50
NA,way which would tend to take away,50
NA,from them the regular amount which they,50
NA,stipulated to receive on making the con-,50
NA,"tract. I believe in the annuity system,",50
NA,and for the reason that the men are,50
NA,benefited to a greater extent than by a,50
NA,lump sum of nioney. The proposal will not,50
NA,prevent men i n the service of the Govern-,50
NA,ment from contracting outside for the,50
NA,sake of theh wives and families for,50
NA,the payment of a large sum of money,50
NA,on their death or at some fixed period.,50
NA,We are all familiar with the system,50
NA,wisely adopted i n connexion with banking,50
NA,and other companies. I believe the Bank,50
NA,of New South Wales has a splendid system,50
NA,of annuities for the bank servants on retire-,50
NA,ment at a certain age. There are other,50
NA,"private companies, which I do not wish to",50
NA,"advertise, but which also adopt this",50
NA,particular method for retiring servants. I,50
NA,think we could not do better than take pat-,50
NA,tern and example from the very excellent,50
NA,results wliich these companies and corpora-,50
NA,tions have' achieved. As a last instance I,50
NA,may cite what I believe is.the South Aus-,50
NA,tralian experience. From what I know,50
NA,of that experience the Government some,50
NA,years ago guaranteed a fund of this,50
NA,kind by paying . into i t a sum of,50
NA,"Â£10,000, though I speak from memory",50
NA,and under correction. This fund is con-,50
NA,tributed to by the servants of the State,50
NA,npon an actuarial scale and along well-,50
NA,"known lines, and I believe tlie guarantee has",50
NA,never been asked for or required i n any,50
NA,direction. The public servants of the,50
NA,which State have achieved for themselves excellent,50
NA,"results, and altogether there does not appear",50
NA,Many to be the slightest intention of departing,50
NA,"from the system, the disposition being rather",50
NA,"to strengthen it, and, if possible, to make",50
NA,i t more extensive. Honorable members,50
NA,from South Australia will probably be,51
NA,able to speak with more authority than I,51
NA,"can on this question, but I believe the facts",51
NA,which I have stated broadly and generally,51
NA,will be found to be correct on closer scrutiny,51
NA,"and investigation. ""What has been done in a",51
NA,State might very well be done i n the Com-,51
NA,monwealth.. I f the experience of South,51
NA,"Australia, Germany, and other -places has",51
NA,"been so entirely successful, we here, just",51
NA,"- initiating a new system for a new nation,",51
NA,-may very well take advantage of the ex-,51
NA,"perience of other countries, and give to the",51
NA,servants of the Government the proper,51
NA,guarantee that they ought to receive and,51
NA,initiate a new system of insurance alto-,51
NA,gether. But I do not advocate the system,51
NA,purely for that reason. I am a believer i n,51
NA,monopolies of this kind being taken in hand,51
NA,by the State itself. That being so I might,51
NA,have advocated the proposal under any cir-,51
NA,"cumstances, but in view of the experience",51
NA,"of other places, and of the apparent success",51
NA,"which attends the system elsewhere, I am",51
NA,tlie -more emboldened to put this proposal,51
NA,forward in the hope of getting i t adopted,51
NA,at the initiation of the new state of affairs,51
NA,in connexion with the Commonwealth.,51
NA,Honorable members would probably remind,51
NA,"me, if I did not mtroduce the subject-matter",51
NA,"myself, of the New Zealand State Life As-",51
NA,surance department. I n that colony a very,51
NA,great advance has been made i n the matter,51
NA,of life assurance - I t has been very pro-,51
NA,"gressive in all matters of sociallegislation,",51
NA,in the matter of State life assurance I think i t,51
NA,has been much more successful than perhaps,51
NA,some lionorable members are aware. From,51
NA,the official records of various kinds that I,51
NA,"have been enabled to peruse, I find that the",51
NA,department was first founded i n 1870. From,51
NA,"that time up to the present some Â£8,000,000",51
NA,sterling has been received i n premiums,51
NA,from various persons assuring their lives,51
NA,witli this department of State. I find,51
NA,further tliat the total number of policies,51
NA,"issued by all the companies of New Zealand,",51
NA,inclusive of the State Assurance depart-,51
NA,"ment, is 75,692. Of that very great number",51
NA,"of pohcies, however, the Government depart-",51
NA,"ment has no less tlian 39,366, or consider-",51
NA,ably more than half. So successful has been,51
NA,"this particular department of State that, as",51
NA,the honorable member for Echuca has just,51
NA,"now pointed out to me, i t practically dis-",51
NA,courages the other compames.,51
Mr MCCOLL ,Th e department makes i t,51
NA,its business to do so.,51
Mr HUME COOK , I have nothing to,51
NA,say on that point at present. New Zealand,51
NA,"is, per unit of population, the most heavily",51
NA,assured country i n the world. I t would be,51
NA,idle and a waste of time to go into great,51
NA,detail as to other matters connected,51
NA,"with this department of State, but from",51
NA,the success of the institution there is,51
NA,very httle likelihood of its ever being put,51
NA,"on one side, and private companies and",51
NA,mutual companies taking its place. The,51
NA,people of New Zealand have learned to,51
NA,realize and appreciate the splendid guarantee,51
NA,which the Government have beliind their,51
NA,undertakings. To such an extent do the,51
NA,people appreciate the system that out of a,51
NA,"total of 75,000 odd policies there are",51
NA,"assured with the department nearly 40,000.",51
Mr HIGGINS ,"I n New Zealand, are",51
NA,others than public servants insured ?,51
Mr HUME COOK ,"Yes , I am speak-",51
NA,"ing generally of the department, which",51
NA,assures anybody. I find that i n the,51
NA,period since the founding of the department,51
NA,"there have been four divisions of profits, and",51
NA,"that altogether Â£1,250,000 has been paidiu",51
NA,bonuses to policy holders.,51
Mr MCCAY ,Reversionary bonuses 1,51
Mr HUME COOK , Reversionary,51
NA,bonuses. The only comment which either,51
NA,private companies or mutual companies,51
NA,make is that tlie bonuses paid by the New,51
NA,Zealand State department are not so great,51
NA,but or high as those paid by mutual companies,51
NA,in New Zealand o r - I speak under correc-,51
NA,tion-i n any case i n Australia. But tlie,51
NA,"answer to that comment is, and i t seems to",51
NA,"be quite effective, that i f the bonuses",51
NA,are not so high neither are the premiums so,51
NA,high. The premiums are lower in every,51
NA,"case, and there are not so many of the",51
NA,hampering conditions attached to the State,51
NA,policies as are attached to most of the,51
NA,policies issued by mutual or private,51
NA,companies. The concern is looked on,51
NA,"in a business-like way, and conducted on",51
NA,"sound actuarial lines, and is, so far as I am",51
NA,"able to judge, a most successful institution.",51
NA,The investments of the department i n New,51
NA,"Zealand are hnhted, and properly limited,",51
NA,"to municipal and national securities, and to",51
NA,that extent assurers are further safeguarded.,51
NA,These remarks give as briefly as I could,51
NA,"possibly give, without taking up more time",51
NA,"than is necessary, some indication of the",51
NA,success with which this department has been,51
NA,inaugurated and carried on in New Zealand.,51
NA,I do not know that we in the Common-,52
NA,"wealth of Australia, in the light of these",52
NA,"circumstances, and of the proved experience",52
NA,"of that colony, and of tlie older coun-",52
NA,"tries I have named, need have any great",52
NA,hesitancy in adopting this principle. It may,52
NA,be that there are reasons of expediency,52
NA,"which may be put forward, and"" which might",52
NA,upset the calculations and theories I am,52
NA,announcing. At the same time I shall,52
NA,require to be very fully satisfied on that,52
NA,head before withdrawing tlie proposal I now,52
NA,make. The only point which perhaps may,52
NA,weigh with the committee-and I have,52
NA,"been reminded of ""it by the honorable and",52
NA,"learned member for . Corinella - is, as",52
NA,to the amount of business,52
NA,could be done under my proposal.,52
NA,"Honorable members, if they look at. the",52
NA,"clause, will see that all those who are",52
NA,transferred to the Commonwealth from the,52
NA,"departments of the States will, so far as my",52
NA,"knowledge goes, be already insured with",52
NA,some co-operative companies; so that only,52
NA,those coming hi as new appointees will be,52
NA,affected by my proposal. The number of,52
NA,those new appointees will probably not be,52
NA,very great for some time to come.,52
NA,that appears to me to be one of the,52
NA,soundest reasons for adopting this pro-,52
NA,posal. Just because the number .will,52
NA,"not be very great, the scheme could",52
NA,be initiated on lines which will give,52
NA,some indication of how it could be extended,52
NA,"later on, and to what extent it could be",52
NA,developed. I would go further with the,52
NA,"proposal if opportunity allowed, and create",52
NA,"a State Life Assurance department, as",52
NA,"in New Zealand, so that those outside the",52
NA,"service as well as those inside might, if they",52
NA,"chose, assure tlieir lives with a guaranteed",52
NA,State department. But I cannot do that,52
NA,in a proposal connected with this Bill.,52
NA,do propose to do something of tlie kind,52
NA,under the form of a general motion which,52
NA,"is on tlie notice - paper, and which I",52
NA,.shall move when opportunity and con-,52
NA,venience permit. In submitting the pre-,52
NA,"sent amendment, as honorable",52
NA,"-will see, I am necessarily limited.",52
NA,"not think, however, that the present pro-",52
NA,posal ought to be the means of withholding,52
NA,"our hands, but on tlie contrary we may",52
NA,-take it that if the State once adopt the,52
NA,"-principal it can be easily extended, and",52
NA,possibly so far extended as to include a,52
NA,".State Life Assurance department,",52
NA,.tliose outside the civil service as well as,52
NA,Mr Hume Cook.,52
NA,those in i t . Since the proposal has been cir-,52
NA,culated quite a number of the servants of the,52
NA,"Commonwealth, who are already assured with",52
NA,"companies of one sort or another, have asked",52
NA,me whether i t would be possible for them,52
NA,to transfer their policies from private or,52
NA,mutual companies to the Commonwealth,52
NA,"Department, i f such a department were",52
NA,"constituted. I , of course, could give no",52
NA,%,52
NA,"answer to them on that head, but their",52
NA,"inquiry was an indication to me, at any",52
NA,rate that tliey were desirous of coming,52
NA,into a department which would be con-,52
NA,"just trolled, managed, and guaranteed by the",52
NA,"State, and that i f the principle were once",52
NA,adopted probably quite a number of per-,52
NA,"which sons would, i f such facilities were offered,",52
NA,eagerly embrace the opportunity. I have,52
NA,already said that I infinitely prefer the,52
NA,system of annuities to the giving of,52
NA,"a lump sum, and apparently the former",52
NA,"is to be the proposal i n the Bill, with cer-",52
NA,tain exceptions. As a last word on this,52
NA,"head, I would like to say that, from remarks",52
NA,made to me in connexion with the present,52
NA,"system, i t would appear that some alteration",52
NA,is necessary to prevent what looks like an,52
NA,But abuse. I have lieard i t asserted-an d I,52
NA,have no reason to disbelieve the statements,52
NA,made to me-tha t oflieers of departments,52
NA,and others connected with the State ser-,52
NA,"vice have, in"" some instances, made com-",52
NA,missions out of proposals for State in-,52
NA,surance by members ofthe staffs. I do,52
NA,not know that this is true. I have no,52
NA,"reason to say, from my own knowledge, that",52
NA,"i t is true, but I have heard i t asserted. I f",52
NA,"i t is true, that kind of thing ought, to be",52
NA,stopped.,52
An HONOURABLE MEMBER , I t is true.,52
Mr HUME COOK , I know nothing,52
NA,"myself personally, but I now hear i t asserted",52
NA,I that tlie statement is true. I f i t is not,52
NA,"true, no harm is done, but if i t is true, the",52
NA,system ought to be stopped. I n 1892 tlie,52
NA,"civil servants in Victoria, realizing to a",52
NA,large extent the disabilities under which,52
NA,they laboured i n respect to matters of,52
NA,"members this kind, put forward a very positive pro-",52
NA,I do posal for life insurance amongst themselves.,52
NA,The proposal met with a very great deal of,52
NA,support i n the service generally and,52
NA,"from outside quarters; but, unfortunately",52
NA,"for those who had the matter in hand, they",52
NA,so overloaded their scheme with con-,52
NA,"ditions in the shape of fidelity guarantees,",52
NA,assuring fire insurance premiums in connexion with,52
NA,"the houses and property of men i n the service,",52
NA,"and so on, so that the matter fell through.",53
NA,Upon tliis subject the Atje newspaper of material,53
NA,"6th January, 1893, had an exceedingly able are",53
NA,article. I do not propose to read the whole,53
NA,"of it, but with the permission of the a livelihood.",53
NA,committee I intend reading a short pasI,53
NA,sage to show how that journal viewed,53
NA,the proposal of life assurance guaranteed,53
NA,the State and supported by the members.,53
NA,the service. The article states:-,53
NA,Thei'e is no reason whyfcheproject submitted,53
NA,to the meeting of public servants held on Friday,53
NA,"evening, at the Olderfleet, should not be successment",53
NA,fully launched. The law. requires that all,53
NA,bers of the service holding positions ef trust,53
NA,obtain fidelity guarantee policies involving,53
NA,payment of a large sum each year in the Bhape of,53
NA,premiums: In addition to this compulsory,53
NA,outlay the greafc majority of the officials insure,53
NA,fcheir lives as a measure of precaution,53
NA,"to their relatives, besides making payand I",53
NA,"ments for protection against lire, sickness,",53
NA,"accident, and other disabilities of daily experience.",53
NA,The proposals drawn up by Messrs. Kelsall,53
NA,"MCOuinness, of the Customs department, and",53
NA,"Gidderson, offcheVictorian railways, suggest",53
NA,formation of an Insurance Association on the,53
NA,"mutual principle within the service, sofchatthe",53
NA,profits accruing shall be divided among the,53
NA,tributors instead of being dissipated over various,53
NA,corporations. The meeting accepted the,53
NA,"ion, and a committee of ten, inclusive offchethree",53
NA,"gentlemen named, was appointed to prepare",53
NA,definite scheme and report to a future gathering.,53
NA,"In respect to life assurance, nothing can be",53
NA,than a combination of the description,53
NA,"plated, provided ifc be conducted in accordance",53
NA,wifch competent actuarial direction. The principle,53
NA,of mutuality has been demonstrated to be,53
NA,"lable if properly worked ; as, however, the receipts",53
NA,"accumulate with rapidity infcheopening years,",53
NA,"and the claims are few, ifc is the easiest",53
NA,possible for amateur assurers to get hopelessly,53
NA,involved while believingfchafcthey stand in,53
NA,"position of undoubted security. To avoid risk, it",53
NA,will be necessary forfchefiguresto be exhaustively,53
NA,reviewed by a firm of actuaries whose reputation,53
NA,is beyond suspicion. If Government assist the,53
NA,"projected association by a guarantee of Â£-20,000,",53
NA,"as Mr Kelsall has suggested, its -operations",53
NA,"will, perforce, have to be placed under",53
NA,scientific supervision. Assurance against deatli,53
NA,can only be adequately carried on nowget,53
NA,"adays in conjunction with endownment asit,",53
NA,"surance ; and the hitter, as we pointed out",53
NA,bhe article to which reference was made at,53
NA,"meeting, materially helps in attracting the best",53
NA,class of lives. People in perfect health naturally,53
NA,prefer to look for the benefit arising from their,53
NA,"thrift in their life-time, and the promise of",53
NA,ment on attaining a specified age-enables them,53
NA,enjoy this prospect. I t is quite probable for such,53
NA,an outlook to have a beneficial effect on their,53
NA,vitality. The experience of the Australian,53
NA,Mutual Provident Society has shownfchafcfche,53
NA,mortality table improves in proportion as,53
NA,number of endowment policies gains on the num-,53
NA,ber of whole life' policies. The Public Service,53
NA,"Association, if it be formed, will have to enter",53
NA,fully on this branch of the business. Persons,53
NA,[112],53
NA,the employ of tlie State furnish admittedly good,53
NA,"for life assurance purposes, as they gain",53
NA,"their appointments by a process of selection, aud",53
NA,"not, or at least need nofc, be affected by the",53
NA,worries incidental to the ordinary struggles for,53
NA,t seems to me that if this proposal is,53
NA,"adopted, sometliing like the suggestion",53
NA,by contained in that article would have to be,53
NA,of incorporated with i t . The Government,53
NA,would have to set aside a certain sum of,53
NA,money i n order to guarantee the depart-,53
NA,in its earlier years. That would be a,53
NA,"memwise and proper step to take, and under all",53
NA,shall the ch-cumstahces a move in the right,53
NA,the direction. I am very grateful to the com-,53
NA,mittee for listening to me so patiently while,53
NA,discussing this subject. I have endeavoured,53
NA,"due to cut my - remarks as short as possible,",53
NA,"move the amendment, with",53
NA,the f u l l knowledge that quite a number,53
NA,and of the general public are very much,53
NA,"Mr enamoured of such a proposal, and that a",53
NA,the considerable section of this House approve,53
NA,"of the principle. I submit the amendment,",53
NA,"conperhaps in a somewhat crude form, with a",53
NA,desire to obtain a ful l expression of opinion,53
NA,suggestby the committee upon the principle,53
NA,a mvolved. I believe very strongly i n State,53
NA,"Life Assurance, and I see no other opening",53
NA,safer upon wliich I could get the matter discussed,53
NA,"contemin connexion with this Bill. I trust,",53
NA,"however, that if we carry my proposal, i t",53
NA,inviowill be the means of initiating a system,53
NA,w'hich will eventually-develop into a State,53
NA,"- Life Assurance Department, embracing",53
NA,thing members of the outside public as well as,53
NA,a those who are in the Commonwealth service.,53
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ,Went-,53
NA,worth) - I do not propose to say very much,53
NA,"at this stage of the debate, because I . think",53
NA,thisjs eminently a question upon which i t,53
NA,"might be reasonable to keep an open mind,",53
NA,I t is a matter upon which we ah desire to,53
NA,the fullest information possible. I take,53
NA,"however, tliat the insertion of this and",53
NA,iu other clauses proves that the Government,53
NA,fche had in the first place a desire to create,53
NA,some kind of fund for the maintenance of,53
NA,"civil servants i n their old age, and furtlier,",53
NA,"endowthat they had also the idea of a fund that,",53
NA,"to in case of the death of public servants,",53
NA,would help to reheve the necessities of their,53
NA,widows and children. I do not agree with,53
NA,the lionorable meinber for Bourke i n liis,53
NA,fche view with regard to annuities. I n New,53
NA,"South Wales we had a sort of fund which, I",53
NA,"believe for years was bankrupt, and one re-",53
NA,in sult was that when an officer -retired from,53
NA,the puhlic service-and they do not often,54
NA,retire until they are made to do so-he was,54
NA,naturally of an age when the possibilities of,54
NA,life were not very great. It seems to me an,54
NA,absolute cruelty to give a man who is 60,54
NA,years of age a pension - he may not,54
NA,live for more than five years-and then to,54
NA,leave his widow and family to tlie cold,54
NA,mercies of the world. In that case we were,54
NA,put in a very awkward position. We were,54
NA,"permitted to give the widow, in case she",54
NA,"Came before us in forma pav/peris, an allow-",54
NA,"ance. But the man who had saved a little,",54
NA,"hut not sufficient to keep him decently,",54
NA,Could not claim an allowance in forma,54
NA,pauperis. The system was thus practically,54
NA,offering a'premium to negligence. I take,54
NA,it that the object of the Government in this,54
NA,case is to introduce in the first place a,54
NA,system of endowment-tlie same system that,54
NA,is carried out in all assurance offices-by,54
NA,Avhich a certain amount is to be paid if a,54
NA,"man dies before a certain period, which",54
NA,amount goes to his widow and family if he,54
NA,"so wills it, whilst if he reaches a certain",54
NA,age he gets a lump sum to deal with,54
NA,as he desires. I take it tliat the object of,54
NA,the Minister in this new departure is to,54
NA,create to a large extent a desire in the,54
NA,minds of public servants to keep theirlives,54
NA,"properly assured, and to help generally the",54
NA,system of life assurance Avhich Avill do an,54
NA,enormous work in the future,54
NA,people of different countries. I see veiy,54
NA,little difference between the old system and,54
NA,the proposal of Government assurance for,54
NA,this particular purpose. I think that my,54
NA,honorable friend must have been largely led,54
NA,to his views by the hope that he would,54
NA,create a nucleus which Avould ultimately,54
NA,groAV into a State assurance fund. I dp not,54
NA,think Ave ought on a Bill like this to attempt,54
NA,to create a system of this kind. I do not,54
NA,know even that it has been so A ery success-,54
NA,ful as tlie honorable gentleman supposes in,54
NA,another State. But I should be veiy glad,54
NA,to give this system a fair trial.,54
NA,think it is an experiment which we may,54
NA,make wifch great benefit fco the service as a,54
NA,Avhole. It brings home in concrete form to,54
NA,a man tlie fact that he has a property or an,54
NA,assetwhich providesagainst the contingencies,54
NA,of the future. I feel there are one or two,54
NA,Aveak spots in the proposal to Avhich tlie,54
NA,honorable member has referred. I think it,54
NA,Avill be necessaiy to have a schedule of,54
NA,Offices approved by ' the Government.,54
NA,I should also feel that that involved this,54
NA,Sir William MCMillan.,54
NA,Bill.,54
NA,result: that i f by any chance one of those,54
NA,offices failed fche Government would be i n,54
NA,a very difficult position in dealing with those,54
NA,Avho. had insured in that office.,54
Mr SALMON ,The y would simply have to,54
NA,take i t up.,54
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , I believe,54
NA,that in such a contingency tlie Government,54
NA,Avould have to make the position right for,54
NA,"the individual servants concerned. That, is",54
NA,"to my mind, the great argument that may",54
NA,be used against the life insurance principle.,54
NA,"Still, I think that if the schedule is carefully",54
NA,"prepared, i t is a very remote contingency.",54
NA,"Certainly, we have to choose now between",54
NA,the proposal of the Government and a pen-,54
NA,sion fund created by the State. The pen-,54
NA,sion fund Avould need to have a large,54
NA,amount of money placed to its credit to put,54
NA,i t upon a sound actuarial footing. I do not,54
NA,agree with the honorable member for,54
NA,Bourke that there is an advantage i n the,54
NA,small number that Avill first come under the,54
NA,"provisions of the Bill, because the fact of our",54
NA,"going to outside offices, in Avhich there are",54
NA,.thousands and hundreds of thousands of,54
NA,"policy holders, Avill enable us to start at",54
NA,"once upon a sound basis, as if Ave",54
NA,had had for years a State assurance,54
NA,fund. I do feel more generally in tliis,54
NA,matter than the particular case might,54
NA,"indicate, because I am a very strong up-",54
NA,among holder of the principle of life assurance. I,54
NA,"believe i t is a system Avhich, i f properly",54
NA,"carried out, and i f the people are",54
NA,"indoctrinated Avith ifc, may save tlie",54
NA,country a very great many old-age,54
NA,pensions. I find that when once a,54
NA,man has taken out a policy of life assurance,54
NA,"and sees the benefit of it, when helooks at",54
NA,the reversionary bonuses which are declared,54
NA,"year after year, or at the quinquennial",54
NA,"periods, he has a desire to put his savings into",54
NA,T,54
NA,that particular kind of inA^estment. I am,54
NA,sure I shall have the sympathy of honor-,54
NA,able members Avhen I say that if many of,54
NA,I us had put our savings into that particular,54
NA,kind of instrument we would have been,54
NA,"better off to-day than Ave ai-e. Therefore,",54
NA,Avhilst I think that the question is very,54
NA,"arguable, I am hiclined to take i t as an",54
NA,experiment. Of course an experiment,54
NA,seems rather dangerous in laying the foun-,54
NA,dation of a principle which must be carried,54
NA,"on, probably for all time. Still I think that",54
NA,"i t is so sound in every Avay,. that i t so meets",54
NA,"But the conditions of the pubhc servant, and is",54
NA,"such an incentive to saving, that i t would be",54
NA,well if tliis House-whethe r i t requires modi-,55
NA,fications ornot I cannot say-woul d accept it.,55
NA,I do not mean life assurance under the,55
NA,State ; I do not mean a fund which is really,55
NA,a pension fund ; but the principle of every,55
NA,"man assuring his life, on entering the public",55
NA,"service, in a reputable office. Under a",55
NA,"scheme like this, he would, as in any other",55
NA,"condition of life, increase his assurance as",55
NA,"the years went on, and provide, not merely",55
NA,"an annuity, which would be practically the",55
NA,"interest on the endowment, for himself, but",55
NA,a fund by which he would be assured that,55
NA,his widow would be left comfortably off.,55
Mr SALMON ,Laanecoorie) - I quite,55
NA,agree with the honorable meinber for Went-,55
NA,"worth that i t would not be well, at this",55
NA,"juncture, to deal with the matter of State life",55
NA,insurance. The suggestion of the honorable,55
NA,"member for Bourke is that we should try, as an",55
NA,"experiment, a limited State life assurance,",55
NA,"in such a way, and under such conditions,",55
NA,that I felt perfectly certain no loss,55
NA,"could accrue to the State, whilst a",55
NA,greater sense of security would be given,55
NA,to those who participate i n i t . The honor-,55
NA,able member for Bourke referred to the,55
NA,scheme that was i n operation i n South,55
NA,"Australia, and the acting leader of the",55
NA,Opposition said he was not sure that that,55
NA,had been altogether satisfactory.,55
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , I was refer-,55
NA,ring to New Zealand.,55
Mr SALMON ,Wit h regard to South,55
NA,"Australia, where the system is limited to",55
NA,one public department fpr the present-th e,55
NA,Education department-i t has been i n,55
NA,operation for some years.,55
Mr BATCHELOR ,Tha t is a superannua-,55
NA,"tion scheme, but a system of life assurance",55
NA,has been in operation for about the same,55
NA,time i u the railway service.,55
Mr SALMON ," I t has been found that,",55
NA,although the Government gave a guarantee,55
NA,"when the fund was first started, no call",55
NA,"upon them has ever been necessary, and",55
NA,"' the fund is now absolutely self-supporting,",55
NA,and so safely and securely established that,55
NA,i t is able to stand alone. I n addition to,55
NA,that I am informed that i t is intended to,55
NA,extend the system to other branches of the,55
NA,"service, so that the whole of the State ser-",55
NA,vants may be brought under its provisions.,55
NA,I am one of tliose who believe that we should,55
NA,as far as possible provide for those who do,55
NA,"the work of the State, and that we should",55
NA,not liave the spectacle of men who have,55
NA,given the best years of their life to the public,55
NA,service being compelled i n tlieir old age,55
NA,to ask for charity. Under the scheme I,55
NA,have already spoken of the men themselves,55
NA,"contribute, and the whole of the funds are",55
NA,provided by those who work i n the depart-,55
NA,"ment, and they have the sense of security",55
NA,wliich is so necessary to the satisfactory,55
NA,working of life assurance business. Theacting,55
NA,leader of the Opposition allows at once that,55
NA,"if we had a schedule of approved offices, and",55
NA,"if any one of these offices became insolvent,",55
NA,there would be at least a moral obligation,55
NA,on the part of the Governnient to come to,55
NA,the assistance of those who had assured in the,55
NA,defaulting office; but we could obviate all,55
NA,that by the Commonwealth taking the,55
NA,responsibility from the very start.,55
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , I do not think,55
NA,we should get as good results.,55
Mr SALMON ,Wh y not 1 I t could be,55
NA,worked by the State at a great deal less ex-,55
NA,pense.,55
Mr MAUGER ,AVha t capital would be .,55
NA,involved at first?,55
Mr SALMON ,Th e amount of capital,55
NA,would depend upon the number of people,55
NA,who became assured.,55
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLIAN , Surely the.,55
NA,r,55
NA,honorable member could not expect to give,55
NA,the same scale of bonuses as the Australian,55
NA,"Mutual Provident Society, for instance ?",55
Mr SALMON , I am not suggesting,55
NA,that the Government should go into the,55
NA,business for the sake of making money.,55
NA,The only people who should derive any,55
NA,benefit should be those who insure their,55
NA,"lives. Further, the only benefits which",55
NA,should accrue should be in the shape of,55
NA,reduced premiums.,55
Mr MCCOLL ,Ther e would be no oppor-,55
NA,tunity of making profits such as would pro-,55
NA,"vide reasonably, good bonuses.",55
Mr SALMON , I sincerely trust that I,55
NA,"shall never see the State going i n foi"" an as-",55
NA,surance business conducted on those lines.,55
NA,The only reason why State assurance,55
NA,should be established is in order that people,55
NA,may liave opportunities of assuring their,55
NA,"lives more cheaply, and that is the only",55
NA,direction in wliich they should get the,55
NA,benefit. I think State assurance could be,55
NA,undertaken with regard to the officers of,55
NA,the State with more advantage than by,55
NA,"private companies, because there ought npt",55
NA,to be the same expense connected with get-,55
NA,ting the policies talcen up. No commissions,55
NA,"would have to be paid, and in addition to",55
NA,that the State would be absolutely certain,56
NA,"of receiving its payments, because there",56
NA,"would be no dropping out, and no claims",56
NA,"made upon the Government for "" time",56
NA,"pay."" The whole thing would be worked",56
NA,by deductions from the salaries paid,56
NA,Government officers. This matter of State,56
NA,life assurance has been sufficiently investinot;,56
NA,"gated, and the results, both here and on",56
NA,"Continent, have been such as to warrant",56
NA,us in taking tlie step I have indicated.,56
NA,should like to see the whole of,56
NA,wealth .servants assured .under a .system-,56
NA,"backed up by the Commonwealth, and",56
NA,safer and cheaper than any other system,56
NA,possible.,56
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Macquarie) -,56
NA,Whilst I feel that the honorable member,56
NA,for Bourke has raised a very important,56
NA,"question, I think i t would be very hard on is necessary.",56
NA,some of the public servants i f they were,56
NA,compelled to limit themselves to an assurthat,56
NA,ance company supported by the Governto,56
NA,ment. We all know the way in which,56
NA,some of these assurance companies are,56
NA,"worked, and the amounts of bonuses",56
NA,"to the members, and I am afraid that,",56
NA,to the limited number of persons who would,56
NA,be able to contribute' to the proposed as- - Mr MCCAY,56
NA,"surance fund, tliere would not be the same",56
NA,amount available for bonuses as is the case list.,56
NA,"with the private companies. I doubt, in",56
NA,"fact, whether those who invested in the",56
NA,State assurance fund would get any bonuses,56
NA,".at all. I n the first place, the fund",56
NA,will apply only to probationers and to,56
NA,"newly-appointed officers, and the number",56
NA,"of these will be limited. Therefore, not",56
NA,only would the scope of the proposed fund,56
NA,"be limited, but there would not be tlie same",56
NA,-opportunity for investments of funds.,56
Mr SALMON ,The y will not be .able,56
NA,".sweat their employes, any way.",56
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I think the,56
NA,Government might very well leave i t to,56
NA,their employes to judge as to the best means,56
NA,-of insuring themselves.,56
Mr FOWLER ,Why compel them,56
NA,insure at all ? Why not leave that to their,56
NA,own opinion 1,56
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I think i t is,56
NA,wise to compel Government servants to,56
NA,"insure, for the reasons stated by the honorto",56
NA,able member for Wentworth.,56
Mr MOCAY ,Doe s the honorable memtliat,56
NA,ber believe i n having an approved list,56
NA,offices ?,56
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,M y opinion is,56
NA,that the assurance companies ought to be,56
NA,registered and that there ought to be some,56
NA,to guarantee as to their stability.,56
Mr HIGGINS ,Woul d the honorable mem-,56
NA,to ber make the Government guarantee them ?,56
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,"No , I would",56
NA,but I tliink the accounts ought to be,56
NA,the gone into and audited in the same way as,56
NA,has been done in some other cases.,56
An HONOURABLE MEMBER ,Wher e would,56
NA,the Commonthe guarantee come from?,56
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Ther e is no,56
NA,r,56
NA,"necessity for a guarantee, and the Govern-",56
NA,ment would have no right to give a,56
NA,guarantee.,56
Mr OMALLEY , I f the Government,56
NA,forces the assurance offices to invest tlieir,56
NA,surplus funds i n State bonds that is all that,56
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , M y opinion is,56
NA,we should compel Government servants,56
NA,"assure, but we should not say ""Not-",56
NA,withstanding the fact that i t is a bad,56
NA,investment we are going to compel you to,56
NA,"paid insure in the State Assurance Fund.""",56
NA,owing I think that the Govemment employes,56
NA,should be allowed to insure where they like.,56
NA,- I thought the honorable,56
NA,member said he believed i n an approved,56
Mr SYDNEYSMITH , I believe in,56
NA,assurance companies having to certify tbat,56
NA,their accounts are i n accordance with,56
NA,their balance-sheets. I do not think,56
NA,i t would be possible to register assurance,56
NA,"companies, but we all know what has taken",56
NA,"place during the last few years, and I think",56
NA,i t would be a good thing if the accounte of,56
NA,these companies were certified to as being i n,56
NA,order. Whilst I quite agree with the ne-,56
NA,"to cessity for some assurance arrangements, I",56
NA,think i t would be a hard thing to compel,56
NA,the Government servants to assure i n the,56
NA,Government fund and prevent them from,56
NA,"going to societies which would, perhaps,,",56
NA,give them better. bonuses tlian the Govern-,56
NA,ment could do.,56
to . Mr MCCOLL ,Echuca) - I trust we are,56
NA,not going to be led into an academic dis-,56
NA,"cussion at this stage, because I do not think",56
NA,that the occasion is an opportune one. The,56
NA,remarks I had intended to make have been,56
NA,some extent anticipated by the honorable,56
NA,member for Macquarie. I do not think,56
NA,we can possibly look for success witli a,56
NA,of State assurance fund started just now. One,56
NA,i of the matters that the Commonwealth,56
NA,has power to take up is that of as-,57
NA,"surance, and the whole* question as to",57
NA,whether officers should assure with the,57
NA,State or not can very well he left open,57
NA,"to be dealt witli at some future time,",57
NA,especially as some considerable period must,57
NA,elapse before any number of officers could,57
NA,join an assurance fund. I f there is one,57
NA,tiling that the Australian people have reason,57
NA,to be proud of i t is their mutual assurance,57
NA,"companies, which passed absolutely un-",57
NA,scathed through the recent financial crash.,57
Mr MAHON ,The y have not gone on long,57
NA,enough.,57
Mr MCCOLL , They have gone on,57
NA,"for over half a century, and the longer they",57
NA,"have gone, the stronger they have become.",57
Mr MAHON ,Wha t valuations have been,57
NA,made of their securities ?,57
Mr MCCOLL ,I n some cases the best,57
NA,and strictest valuations possible.,57
Mr MAHON ,By whom 1,57
Mr MCCOLL ,B y the highest actuaries,57
NA,of the day. I do not wish to advertise any,57
NA,"companies, but i t is a fact that the Aus-",57
NA,tralian Mutual Provident Society have sub-,57
NA,mitted fcheir figures to the best actuaries of,57
NA,the day to ascertain that they were on a sound,57
NA,and stable basis.,57
Mr MAHON , I t is not to an actuary but,57
NA,"to a valuer, who knows the value of their",57
NA,"assets, that they should be submitted.",57
Mr MCCOLL ,Wher e necessaiy they,57
NA,have recast their figures in order to make,57
NA,them more complete and sound. These,57
NA,"premiums are not found by the State, but are",57
NA,deducted from the salaries of the officials.,57
NA,"I t is right, tlierefore, that for that invest-",57
NA,ment which they are compelled by the State,57
NA,"to make, they should get the best possible",57
NA,return. I n the case of assuring with the,57
NA,C overnment they cannot possibly expect to,57
NA,get a return i n tlie shape of profits for,57
NA,"many years; whereas, i n the case of pro-",57
NA,bably some half-dozen assurance companies,57
NA,the value of their policy will increase so,57
NA,"considerably that, perhaps in 20 or 25",57
NA,"years, i t will double itself. Why should we",57
NA,compel men to assure with the State and,57
NA,literally rob them of that additional profit,57
NA,which should come to them iu their old age,57
NA,and to their children ? One other advantage,57
NA,I think will come to the public i i i this,57
NA,matter. I t has been said that we should,57
NA,allow assurers to select their own oifiees.,57
NA,"We should give them that right, but at the",57
NA,"same time we should have a list, and",57
NA,the Government should see that they,57
NA,":E, 1901.] Pill. 1765-",57
NA,accept only policies i n assurance offices,57
NA,which they found on examination,57
NA,"were sound and stable, and the general",57
NA,pubhc would also have this benefit for-,57
NA,themselves. I agree to a certain extent,57
NA,with the previous speaker that the Govern-,57
NA,ment should keep a strict supervision over,57
NA,"all assurance companies, because we have to",57
NA,take the figures as they are given to us.,57
NA,We have fco take fche figures as they are,57
NA,"audited, and - the figures from their own",57
NA,actuaries; but possibly there may be behind,57
NA,all that some weakness in the office of wliich,57
NA,the members should be made aware. I ffche-,57
NA,State assurers are fco go into these mutual,57
NA,"offices i t will compel the Government, to",57
NA,"keep a stricter check on those offices, and",57
NA,so to fche whole pubhc they will be made,57
NA,even safer than they are.,57
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,The y do i t i n some,57
NA,cases i n America.,57
Mr MCCOLL ,The y do i t in America,57
NA,at the present time. I trust that we shall,57
NA,get a strict supervision both over assurance -,57
NA,companies and over banks as soon as we,57
NA,get our legislative machinery into working-,57
NA,order. I tliink Ave may accept the proposal,57
NA,of the GoA'ernment at the present time.,57
NA,We should not go so very far i n this,57
NA,direction but that Ave can retrace our steps.,57
NA,"We may fairly leave the whole discussion,",57
NA,"I think, until a more com'enient season.",57
Mr MAHON ,Coolgardie) - I intend to,57
NA,support the amendment. Honorable mem-,57
NA,"bers who have spoken against civil servants,",57
NA,being permitted to assure with the Common-,57
NA,"Avealth, have taken i t for granted that their",57
NA,"funds, Avhen invested i n outside companies,",57
NA,Avill realize greater bonuses and .larger-,57
NA,profits than they would do under the,57
NA,Commonwealth. I f these outside companies,57
NA,are earning so much more money than the,57
NA,Commonwealth could do Avith the same,57
NA,"funds, how is i t that the surplus moneys* of",57
NA,many of them are being invested i n Govern-,57
NA,ment and municipal bonds ?,57
Mr MCCOLL ,Ther e is not much weight,57
NA,in that.,57
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ,The y are re-,57
NA,serves.,57
Mr MAHON ,Wha t do these honor-,57
NA,able members mean by talking to us about,57
NA,"the actuarial valuations, about the books",57
NA,"and accounts, about the periodical audits ?. Of",57
NA,Avhat value is that to ascertain or get at the,57
NA,exact position of any of these companies?,57
NA,"We have heard that they have gone on, that",57
NA,none of them has come to grief like the,57
NA,"banking companies orfchebuilding societies,",58
NA,but why is that 1 I t is simply because,58
NA,there could not be a run upon an assurance,58
NA,company the same as there can be on,58
NA,bank. I f i t had been possible for these,58
NA,policy-holders to come in as depositors,58
NA,"do, and demand fcheir money, what would",58
NA,have happened ? Would we have a solvent,58
NA,assurance company ? We would know more,58
NA,about these assurance convpanies to-day than,58
NA,we do.,58
Mr MCCOLL ,The y have all passed,58
NA,-critical stage.,58
Mr MAHON ,Wha t is the use of talkout,58
NA,i n g to me about actuarial valuations ? Does,58
NA,not the solvency of these companies depend,58
NA,- on whether their mortgages will realize,58
NA,. 'amounts which have been advanced on,58
NA,"fchem 1 Is not fchat the real test, and",58
NA,-any one tell me that these societies have',58
NA,ever gone down to bedrock by getting an,58

NA,"-honorable members who want to compel securities,",58
NA,- -civil servants to assure i n these private,58

Mr SALMON ,Ho w would tlie honorable,58

NA,companies ?,58
Mr MAHON , I am not dealing,58
NA,"the American companies, and when we",58
NA,arrive at a decision as to tliose companies,58
NA,shall be prepared to give an expression,58
NA,my opinion. Is i t a preposterous thing,58
NA,-do ? I do not want to sound an alarmist's,58
NA,"note, but let i t be understood that there amendment.",58
NA,-are in Australia not merely' mutual,58
NA,"assurance companies, but actuaUy propriewith",58
NA,tary life assurance companies. Is i,58
NA,object of honorable members to put civil,58
NA,servants at the mercy of men who are view.,58
NA,drawing dividends from the earnings of,58
NA,-assurance companies ? What is to prevent,58
NA,-a proprietary assurance company from,58
NA,putting up its dividends from 10 to 20,58
NA,"cent., and so absorbing its profits or reserves",58
NA,as to become in a short time i n an unsound,58
NA,position ?,58
Mr MCCOLL ,Proprietar y companies,58
NA,scarcely any business at all i n the States,58
Mr MAHON ,"Th e honorable member,",58
NA,"I am afraid, has not exhausted the whole",58
NA,"subject. He would do well, I t h i n k - I do",58
NA,a not want to mention any names-t o look at,58
NA,the business of one industrial proprietory,58
NA,can assurance company i n this country.,58
An HONOURABLE MEMBER ,Th e Citizens.,58
Mr MAHON , I am not an authority.,58
NA,I do not profess to be an actuary or to,58
NA,understand the business of assurance ; I can,58
NA,only say that the volume of this company's,58
NA,the business has grown wonderfully during the,58
NA,last five or six years. When we are starting,58
NA,"to build up a new nation, I do not think",58
NA,i t is our duty to compel our civil servants,58
NA,to assure i n these private companies. The,58
NA,"the honorable member for Wentworth, I believe,",58
NA,admitted that i f there was any default on,58
NA,will the part of these assurance companies the,58
NA,State had a moral obligation to make i t good.,58
NA,inI f these companies are to offer any security,58
NA,what to civil servants we must have a periodical,58
NA,? Do examination of their mortgages and of tbeir,58
NA,"i n order to know how the}' stand,",58
NA,made by independent State auditors-me n,58
NA,will examine every document and every,58
NA,piece of paper representing a security wifch,58
NA,the companies. Look at the enormous ex-,58
NA,That pense !,58
Mr OMALLEY , W e ought to do that,58
Mr MAHON , W e may do that some,58
NA,"time, but i f we compel civil servants to as-",58
NA,sure i n these companies then we have a,58
NA,direct obUgation to do so. I must apologize,58
NA,"for taking up so much time, but I feel very",58
NA,"strongly on this matter, and I hope that the",58
NA,with committee will support the amendment.,58
Mr HIGGINS ,Northern Melbourne) -,58
NA,1 I think the last speaker has made some very,58
NA,of important and valuable observations. He,58
NA,to speaks with a good deal of knowledge of the,58
NA,"subject, and I cordially concur with the",58
NA,The honorable member for,58
NA,"life Echuca opposes it, but I am surprised",58
NA,his experience i n these matters he,58
NA,t the does not see his way clear to avoid the,58
NA,academic view and to take the practical,58
NA,The' difficulty is that he started,58
NA,these with the very.fine statement that we must,58
NA,not have an academic discussion. M y ex-,58
NA,perience is that whenever aman is saying,58
NA,"per what one does not agree with, one calls his",58
NA,"statement academic, while one's own state-",58
NA,ment is practical. The only question is what,58
NA,"is practical, and what is academic. The",58
NA,do proposal has been attacked i n two or,58
NA,"now. three points, but not one of those points is",58
NA,vulnerable. One attack was upon a statement,59
NA,"made by the honorable member for Bourke,",59
NA,that he preferred an annuity to a lump sum.,59
NA,The honorable member for Wentworth has,59
NA,said that he prefers a lump sum to an,59
NA,annuity. That may or may not be preferable.,59
NA,But that does not affect the proposal. The,59
NA,honorable member for Bourke accepts the,59
NA,suggestion of the Ministers in the Bill as,59
NA,to what shall be given- a lump sum or an,59
NA,annuity-hu t that is not a ground for attack-,59
NA,ing his proposal. I conceive that by the,59
NA,assistance of actuaries we could find a,59
NA,method by wliich we could. combine the,59
NA,"two, and hy which a man might feel that",59
NA,"he would get an annuity after 60, and that",59
NA,if his death should occur within a certain,59
NA,"limit, his family should get a lump sum.",59
NA,"Of course, the longer he lived for the",59
NA,"annuity, the less the family would get. I t",59
NA,is a matter on which I have not sufficient,59
NA,"knowledge to speak .with any authority, but I",59
NA,think i t would be well worth while to refer,59
NA,i t to actuaries and to experts to say,59
NA,whether we could not get a policy based,59
NA,"on these lines, giving the annuity with a",59
NA,promise of a lump sum in case the annuity,59
NA,did not run on for a certain number of 3'ears.,59
NA,The next point of attack was that State,59
NA,assurance is not a good business to under-,59
NA,"take. , Of course, the proposal at present is",59
NA,not State assurance for the outside public.,59
NA,As soon as that thing is proposed we can,59
NA,deal with i t . I think we ought to deal with,59
NA,theparticular proposal made here. A l l that is,59
NA,now proposed is that the State shall assure,59
NA,its own servants when i t makes assurance,59
NA,compulsory. AVe are proceeding step by step.,59
NA,"AVe say here to the civil servants, ""You must",59
NA,"assure."" "" I n what are we to assure V they",59
NA,ask. I t is admitted that there must be,59
NA,"recognised companies, that is, companies of a",59
NA,certain standard. I cannot see a way out of,59
NA,"the position, but that we must have certain",59
NA,companies recognised by the Government as,59
NA,being sound ones. I f we recognise a com-,59
NA,"pany and i t fail, the Government is almost",59
NA,"certain to be called upon, ad misericordiam,",59
NA,to pay the amount. AVe are almost certain,59
NA,to be called upon to practically guarantee,59
NA,the amount. I f we practically guarantee,59
NA,"the amount, cannot we go one step forward",59
NA,and assure the men ? That is the position.,59
NA,I need not go over what has been said,59
NA,"already, that ordinary assurance companies",59
NA,"have a very expensive management, under",59
NA,"which 60 per cent, of the first premium goes",59
NA,"to the agent, aad that from all the premiums",59
NA,afterwards collected large deductions have,59
NA,to be made.,59
Mr OMALLEY , I wish that were true.,59
. Mr HIGGINS , I am speaking of,59
NA,agents whom I know. The assurance,59
NA,companies have to keep up expensive,59
NA,"staffs, pay extensive commissions, have",59
NA,big offices to build and interest to pay,59
NA,"011 the cost of those offices, and surely the",59
NA,Government could easily work out a system,59
NA,by which i t could take less premiums,59
NA,from public servants than are required by,59
NA,"outside offices. As to safety, I am happy",59
NA,to say none of the assurance companies,59
NA,"have failed. A t the same time, we want to",59
NA,"give those men, whom we compel to assure,",59
NA,the best security possible. The assurance,59
NA,"companies rest on mortgages and Govern- """,59
NA,"ment securities, and I venture to say that",59
NA,if those Government securities had been,59
NA,taken away from some of the com-,59
NA,"panies during the recent crisis, they would",59
NA,certainly have gone as the banks went.,59
NA,The ultimate security for this country -,59
NA,is the people of the country and the,59
NA,"taxation they can pay-yo n could, not get",59
NA,a better security. I t is much better for,59
NA,"the Government servant, whom we force to",59
NA,"assure, to feel he is resting on the security",59
NA,"of his employer, which is the best security",59
NA,"within his reach, for the payment of the",59
NA,money when i t is due. I cordially support,59
NA,"this proposal, and hope the Minister will",59
NA,see his way to accept it.,59
Mr OMALLEY ,Tasmania) - I do,59
NA,not want i t to be understood I am opposed to,59
NA,"State assurance. I n fact, i f any one can",59
NA,show me that i t is a profitable invest-,59
NA,"ment, I will vote for i t . AVhat I want",59
NA,to try to impress on my honorable friends is,59
NA,"that if the 11,000 civil servants are the only",59
NA,people i n the Commonwealth worthy of pro-,59
NA,"tection, the other thousands, or millions,",59
NA,who have to invest their money in the as-,59
NA,"surance companies hazardously, must be",59
NA,taken as not worthy of consideration.,59
- Mr HUME COOK , I will follow this,59
NA,amendment with another proposal at a later,59
NA,stage.,59
Mr OMALLEY , I quite agree with the,59
NA,honorahle member for Bourke that the,59
NA,amendment is worth a good deal of consider-,59
NA,ation. I want i t distinctly understood that,59
NA,what I say here on this matter is without,59
NA,prejudice. I want that to be under-,59
NA,stood for the simple reason that I have been,59
NA,"twenty years an assurance man, and have",59
NA,made a fortune at the business. Having had,59
NA,"a little experience, I want to say tliat if",60
NA,worth tlie consideration of the Governnient,60
NA,"to give protection to 11,000 civil servants,",60
NA,surely honorahle members i n the State of,60
NA,Victoria all these years have not been doing,60

NA,citizens of Victoria.,60
Mr MAHON ,Le t us make a start now.,60
Mr OMALLEY , W i l l some honorable,60
NA,member explain to me how tlie first assurers,60
NA,for twenty years are going to get a profit ?,60
NA,We have no averages. New Zealand has,60
NA,gone into the business.,60
An HONOURABLE MEMBER ,Ho w did tlie,60
NA,honorable member's company start ?,60
Mr OMALLEY , I will not say a word,60
NA,about my company. I am going - to talk,60
NA,about this matter altogether from the point,60
NA,of view of the Commonwealtli of Australia.,60
NA,For myself I am here to do my duty to the,60
NA,people of the great State of Tasmania.,60
NA,The honorable member for Coolgardie quite,60
NA,rightly says that there are proprietary com-,60
NA,panies. I say that civil servants i n,60
NA,"general or i n particular, or people i n general,",60
NA,should not be thrown out h i the cold,60
NA,world without a certificate of protection,60
NA,by. the Commonwealth. But tlie Common-,60
NA,wealth will have to absolutely enter,60
NA,into tlie business and put their canvassers,60
NA,"on the road, and compete with public com-",60
NA,panies i f tlie Government want to get any,60
NA,averages.,60
Mr HIGGINS ,I f tlie people are com-,60
NA,pelled to insure we want no canvassers.,60
Mr OMALLEY ,"Onl y the' 11,000",60
NA,civil servants can be compelled to insure.,60
NA,AVe cannot step i n and make i t national,60
NA,compulsory assurance.,60
An HONOURABLE MEMBER ,"Yes , we can.",60
Mr OMALLEY ,"Ver y well then, we",60
NA,come back to first principles. I want to,60
NA,"know, will the State put up an immense",60
NA,sum at the start to earn the interest to pay,60
NA,the first policies? I t is all right to talk,60
NA,"these fabulous"" sums, but I find i t is an",60
NA,eternal hard thing to get hold of them.,60
Mr FOWLER ,Whaf c do private companies,60
NA,do when they start ?,60
Mr OMALLEY , A l l the honorable,60
NA,member for Bourke says I have lieard many,60
NA,"times on the question, and I am quite witli",60
NA,"him. The question is, is i t not the duty of the",60
NA,Commonwealth Parliament to guarantee,60
NA,every man i n the Commonwealth tliat he is,60
NA,safe when he has taken oiit assurance for his,60
NA,family. Let us start right and have a con-,60
NA,"troller of assurance. I n the United States,",60
NA,"i t is before a national bank can be started, 90",60
NA,"per cent, of tlie gold representing the note",60
NA,issue must be deposited in the United,60
NA,"States Treasury, so that when a bank crosses",60
NA,"the Jordan, and you have a note in your",60
NA,"pocket, you know that its golden redeemer",60
NA,liveth. Is the Commonwealth Government,60
NA,i n the position to start that way ? Let us,60
NA,have i n the Commonwealth of Australia,60
NA,"40, 50, or if necessary 100 actuaries who",60
NA,will be under the controller of finance. Let,60
NA,us i n the first place start to reorganize our,60
NA,banking system. Tliere is a precedent for,60
NA,"that, and I know i n British countries you",60
NA,never act until you find out whether your,60
NA,father or your grandfather has done the,60
NA,same tiling before you. The Premier of,60
NA,the great Canadian Dominion compelled the,60
NA,"banks to deposit 40 per cent, of their legal",60
NA,"gold reserve, and they had to take i t i n",60
NA,Canadian Legal Tender Notes. The money,60
NA,"is lying i n the vaults unutilized, arid of no",60
NA,"benefit to anybody. I t creates no industries,",60
NA,and does nothing except to guarantee people,60
NA,that i ffcheywantfcheirmoney they can come,60
NA,"and get it , and when people know they can",60
NA,get their money they do not want i t . L e t,60
NA,us start rightly i n Australia. Let us-,60
NA,"compel the banks not to pay 40 per cent,",60
NA,"but 50 per cent, of the Â£21,000,000 they",60
NA,have lying i n their vaults. That would,60
NA,"start us with Â£10,000,000 of money fco",60
NA,"commence with, and may be then we would",60
NA,"be able to start life assurance, because",60
NA,there would be something to earn some-,60
NA,thing. The Government have no more,60
NA,power to make money than has an ordi-,60
NA,nary man i n the street. Every dollar,60
NA,must be dug out of the earth and earned ;,60
NA,we would be all millionaires i f we could,60
NA,"make money. A l l we have to do on this,",60
NA,question is simply to bring the assurance,60
NA,companies under Commonwealth super-,60
NA,vision and send actuaries to calculate the,60
NA,"about reserves and expenses, and value the securi-",60
NA,ties.,60
Mr MAHON ,Tha t is the point.,60
Mr OMALLEY ,Th e actuaries ought,60
NA,to be satisfied with the balance sheets every,60
NA,"year, and a company that is unable to",60
NA,comply with the actuarial calculation or,60
NA,valuation should be turned out of the Com-,60
NA,monwealth. Let us bury them and go to,60
NA,their funerals at once. I am prepared to,60
NA,furnish second-hand coffins for them.,60
An HONOURABLE MEMBER ,Free ?,60
Mr OMALLEY , N o t exactly free. The,60
NA,members of every Legislature in this country,60
NA,are morally responsible for tlie family of every,61
NA,man who has insured his life in a company,61
NA,I t is.said that tliis guarantee cannot be given;,61
NA,"but i t is done i n Canada, i n the States of",61
NA,"New York, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts,",61
NA,and. almost every other State of the American,61
NA,Union. Surely i n tbe United States noth-,61
NA,ing has been done tliat we cannot do here.,61
NA,"Let us then begin aright, and compel every",61
NA,assurance company i n the Commonwealth to,61
NA,come undei' State supervision. Let the,61
NA,Minister have a list of the companies and,61
NA,tell the civil servants the companies i n which,61
NA,they must assure. These companies should,61
NA,then be compelled to deposit their legal re-,61
NA,serve in Commonwealth Governnient deben-,61
NA,"tures, and i t sbould be seen that these",61
NA,"reserves are sufficient to cover every policy,",61
NA,based on a reasonable calculation. That is,61
NA,"""all that could he done if we had Government",61
NA,assurance. The amount invested i n Com-,61
NA,"monwealth bonds, held by the Common-",61
NA,"wealth, should be equal to the amount owing",61
NA,"to the civil servants, and I am sure lots of",61
NA,splendid assurance companies could be found,61
NA,to come in and undertake the work. I will,61
NA,be prepared to move an amendment on the,61
NA,amendment to the effect that we should,61
NA,"adopt another system, giving us the benefit",61
NA,"of the companies established, and of com-",61
NA,"panies able to get averages, and then we will",61
NA,"not, perhaps, bankrupt the Commonwealth.",61
NA,There are not only averages in people but,61
NA,averages in countries in life insurance busi-,61
NA,"ness, so that losses met with in one country",61
NA,are made up somewhere else. The offi-,61
NA,cers of the Australian Mutual Provident,61
NA,"Society were wise to see that was the case,",61
NA,and that is why they have struggled to get,61
NA,away to other countries besides Australia,61
NA,with their business.,61
Mr FOWL ER ,Perth) - I have listened,61
NA,very carefully to the speech of the honor-,61
NA,"able membei' for the ""great State of",61
NA,"Tasmania,"" and I fail to see in any-",61
NA,"thing he has said, although I believe",61
NA,"he is an assurance expert, an argument",61
NA,to change me from my resolution to,61
NA,support the amendment of the honorable,61
NA,member for Bourke. I feel that i t is a,61
NA,necessary corollary to compelling civil ser-,61
NA,vants to assure that there should be a State,61
NA,assurance department. I f a great reserve,61
NA,of coin is required in the case of private,61
NA,"assurance companies, I do not consider that",61
NA,such a necessity exists i n the case of the,61
NA,State. We have the whole State security,61
NA,"behind a scheme of State assurance, and",61
NA,that I feel certain would be sufficieiit to,61
NA,commend i t to the civil servants and even,61
NA,to the general pubhc i f tlie scheme were ex-,61
NA,tended to embrace the latter. I do not,61
NA,tliink the scheme of State assurance can be,61
NA,described as an experiment - As the honor-,61
NA,able member for Bourke has already indi-,61
NA,"cated, we have instances of schemes of the",61
NA,nature being successfully carried on i n the,61
NA,various States.,61
Mr MAUGER ,An d by private proprie-,61
NA,tors.,61
Mr FOWLER ,Certainly . I f such a,61
NA,"scheme can be carried on in the States, I '",61
NA,do not see why we have fewer chances of its,61
NA,success i n the Commonwealth of Australia.,61
NA,There is another matter which I think,61
NA,worthy of consideration. The large expense,61
NA,of carrying on these private assurance com-,61
NA,"panies has already been commented on, and",61
NA,I believe that-expense amounts in some cases,61
NA,"to 75 per cent, of tlie profit.",61
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ,Thos e are tlie,61
NA,first premiums.,61
Mr FO WLER ,Tha t may be so. But in,61
NA,the case of civil servants there is no neces-,61
NA,sity for commission agents to go round to,61
NA,"secure the necessary business. Why, then""",61
NA,penalize the civil servants to the extent,61
NA,which is necessary in the case of those,61
NA,companies who have to send their agents,61
NA,among the general community? I hope,61
NA,the amendment of the honorable member,61
NA,for Bourke will receive the careful considera-,61
NA,"tion of the committee, and i f that careful",61
NA,"consideration be given, I am sure that the",61
NA,principle is one that many members will feel,61
NA,compelled to support.,61
Mr WILKINSON ,Moreton) -On e of,61
NA,the objections that has beenraised to the pro-,61
NA,posal of the honorable member for Bourke,61
NA,seems to me to be rather weak. Most honor-,61
NA,able members who objected to his proposal,61
NA,found fault with i t on the ground that those,61
NA,who require to insure at the beginning would,61
NA,be few i n number. But I would point out,61
NA,tliat i f we are ever to' institute a State,61
NA,Assurance Fund we shall have to face that,61
NA,"difficulty, because those who join at the",61
NA,beginning will have joined under a certain,61
NA,"set of conditions, and i t would be mani-",61
NA,festly unfair at a later stage to' alter tbe,61
NA,"conditions of their service. Consequently,",61
NA,whenever we institute a State assurance,61
NA,"system, we shall have to start with",61
NA,a small number of officers. I was one,61
NA,"who, in 1890, with the honorable member",61
NA,"far Maranoa, took a considerable part in",61
NA,"the matter of the assurance"" of raihvay",62
NA,employes i n Queensland. We had a big,62
NA,"fight over that, and we know the tempta-",62
NA,tion tbat came i n the way of members of,62
NA,that department. I can honestly say that,62
NA,bribes amounting to thousands of pounds,62
NA,were offered to those who had influence,62
NA,over the employes to induce them to join a,62
NA,certain society. That sort of temptation,62
NA,will always exist. We shall always find,62
NA,people who are not too scrupulous. I t,62
NA,is far better to have a State Assur-,62
NA,"ance Society, the business i n connexion",62
NA,"with which can be done openly, than",62
NA,to luy the department open to ne-,62
NA,potism and other evils which would,62
NA,inevitably arise under any other system.,62
NA,I go further than the honorable member for,62
NA,Bourke. I should like the insurance of the,62
NA,whole community to be undertaken by the,62
NA,"State. To my mind, i t is as much a matter",62
NA,of public utility as is the supply of water or,62
NA,gas to the people. The honorable member,62
NA,"for Tasmania,' Mr O'Malley, has told us",62
NA,that he has made a fortune out of assurance.,62
NA,We know thafc huge fortunes have been,62
NA,made out of that business. But when people,62
NA,assure they do so to provide for their own,62
NA,"future needs, and not to benefit others.",62
Mr VL SOLOMON ,Does,62
NA,membei' tliink that this comes within the,62
NA,range of our Constitution 1,62
Mr WILKINSON , W e claim to be,62
NA,able to legislate upon the matter of old-,62
NA,"age pensions, and we shall have to supply",62
NA,the means to enable any such system to be,62
NA,carried out. AVe therefore might as well,62
NA,tax the people to provide for their own old,62
NA,age. I shall certainly - support the pro-,62
NA,"posal of the honorable member for Bourke,",62
NA,believing i t to be a step in the right direc-,62
NA,tion. Though i t may be a small thing at,62
NA,"the beginning, ifc will continue to grow, and",62
NA,by the establishment of this system we,62
NA,shall do away wifch fche evilsfchafcwould,62
NA,otherwise develop into bigger evils as time,62
NA,passed. I am glad to see that the old-fash-,62
NA,ioned pension scheme has not been followed.,62
NA,Among the subjects upon which the Com-,62
NA,monwealth Parliament is empowered to,62
NA,legislate are assurance other than State,62
NA,"assurance, and as the assurance of public",62
NA,officers ancl employes will extend beyond the,62
NA,boundaries of any one State we are,62
NA,quite within our rights in legislating upon,62
NA,this matter. I hope that the proposal of,62
NA,the honorable member for Bourke will com-,62
NA,mand a majority in its favour.,62
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Macquarie) -,62
NA,I am afraid that in addition to the ob-,62
NA,"jections which I have already stated,",62
NA,there is yet another to the proposal of the,62
NA,"honorable member for Bourke, from a civil",62
NA,"servant's point of view."" Let us suppose that",62
NA,an officer joins the service of the Common-,62
NA,wealth who has already effected an assur-,62
NA,ance in some other company for Â£ 3 0 0 or,62
NA,Â£400. Under this clause he will be com-,62
NA,pelled to join the State Assurance Society.,62
Mr HUME COOK ,"No, he will not. Will",62
NA,the honorable member look at clause 43 1,62
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I understood,62
NA,the honorable member to say that he in-,62
NA,tended to establish a State Assurance Eund,62
NA,and to compel every public servant to,62
NA,have a j>olicy in that fund. The honorable,62
NA,"member said that if his proposal were carried,",62
NA,he intended to go one step further.,62
Mr HUME COOK ,Bu t that one step,62
NA,"further is to establish a State Life Assurance """,62
NA,"department, which would bring i n the out-",62
NA,side public.,62
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , Does the,62
NA,honorable member for Bourke intend under,62
NA,his further proposal to compel every officer,62
NA,to come under the State Assurance Fund 1,62
Mr TUDOR ,-Tha t is already provided for,62
NA,the honorable in clause 43.,62
Mr HUME COOK ,Wha t I propose is,62
NA,very simple. I propose that those who are,62
NA,"already insured, and who come under the",62
NA,"provisions of clause 43, shall retain their",62
NA,assurances with the companies as they now,62
NA,"exist, unless they voluntarily choose to sur-",62
NA,render their policies ancl come under the,62
NA,Government fund. But I wish to provide,62
NA,"that those who are not already assured, ancl",62
NA,"who come into the Commonwealth service,",62
NA,shall be compelled to come under the State,62
NA,"Assurance Fund. The further proposals, of",62
NA,"which I spoke, woulcl have the effect of",62
NA,establishing a State Life Assurance depart-,62
NA,"ment, whicli would allow the outside public,",62
NA,"in addition to civil servants, an opportunity",62
NA,to come in.,62
Mr MCCAY ,Corinella) - I confess that,62
NA,this is a matter upon which I have been,62
NA,trying during the debate to make up my,62
NA,"mind, bufc, like Captain Cuttle, I see so",62
NA,much to be said on both sides that I am,62
NA,unable to do so. On the one hand I have,62
NA,for a long time regarded a great many,62
NA,"financial operations, including life as-",62
NA,"surance, as being not only within the com-",62
NA,"petence of the State, but as matters",62
NA,which might very properly be undertaken,62
NA,"by the State. On the other hand, I think",63
NA,that these questions should not be dealt with,63
NA,piecemeal. The strongest argument against,63
NA,the proposal of the honorable member for,63
NA,Bourke is his own statement that this is not,63
NA,"a complete scheme, but that he intends to",63
NA,"follow i t up by a resolution, wliich obviously",63
NA,will accomplish nothing.,63
Mr FOWLER ,--I t is complete i n respect,63
NA,of this Bill.,63
Mr MCCAY ,T o be quite accurate in,63
NA,"language, i t is as much of the scheme as can",63
NA,"be put into the Bill, but i t is not a complete",63
NA,scheme. To complete i t would require a Bill,63
NA,which will need the assent of both Houses,63
NA,of Parliament. The passing of a resolution,63
NA,in this House is a very long way from,63
NA,obtaining the desired result by legislation.,63
NA,I am entirely i n sympathy with the idea,63
NA,contained i n the amendment; but I do not,63
NA,think i t is a matter of such urgency as to,63
NA,compel us to pass i t in this Bill during the,63
NA,"present session, because for many years",63
NA,to come there will be a very small,63
NA,number of. individuals affected by this,63
NA,assurance provision. The bulk of the,63
NA,public servants of the Commonwealth will,63
NA,"belong to the transferred departments, who",63
NA,are expressly exempted from the provisions of,63
NA,the Bill. Honorable members must re-,63
NA,"collect that a life assurance society, in",63
NA,order to be satisfactory to its members-,63
NA,even if i t be purely mutual-mus t be a,63
NA,living and growing body. A t a certain,63
NA,stage in its early life there comes a period,63
NA,when the liabilities begin to accrue; when,63
NA,the debts have to be paid; and unless i t,63
NA,then has an increasing business so as to,63
NA,.enable i t from its revenue to pay the debts,63
NA,"on the deaths, that society from a",63
NA,financial point of view is doomed.,63
NA,ask the honorable member for Bourke,63
NA,if lie anticipates that this ' scheme will,63
NA,"be self-supporting, ancl. will not require",63
NA,contributions from the consolidated revenue,63
NA,to enable i t to live. The honorable member,63
NA,may tell me that i t will be self-supporting,63
NA,"if we bring in the public, but we ma)'",63
NA,not be able to bring in the public. We,63
NA,have no guarantee that we shall get our,63
NA,system of Commonwealth life assurance.,63
Mr SALMON ,Th e lionorable member,63
NA,must not lose sight of the age of the pro-,63
NA,bationer and the time that must elapse,63
NA,before he can make a claim.,63
Mr MCCAY ,Bu t I - would point out,63
NA,thut even probationers die. The death rate,63
NA,may be very small. I do not suppose,63
NA,"however, that i t will be much less than the",63
NA,death rate of any first class life assurance,63
NA,society already i n existence. I t will not be,63
NA,so vastly improved a death rate as to make,63
NA,a difference to the fact that there will not,63
NA,be premiums coming in. I t will take a lot,63
NA,of premiums to stand even a moderate,63
NA,assault.,63
Mr SALMON ,Tha t i3 opposed to ex-,63
NA,perience.,63
Mr MCCAY ,M y own view is that the,63
NA,insertion of these provisions would be more,63
NA,likely to hinder the establishment of State,63
NA,life assurance than to assist it. There are,63
NA,other things which might very well be,63
NA,branches of the same subject i n a State,63
NA,"having only a limited range, so to speak,",63
NA,"such as our own fidelity guarantees, as-",63
NA,"suring our own properties, and working",63
NA,these iu connexion with the notation and,63
NA,"management of our loans, and applying",63
NA,them to the investment of locally floated,63
NA,"loans, etc.",63
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , A n d creating a,63
NA,fine big department.,63
Mr MCCAY ,"Yes , creating a depart-",63
NA,"ment which I , for one, am not afraid to an-",63
NA,ticipate. But I am frankly afraid of the,63
NA,responsibility which might be involved if we,63
NA,did not get the outside public to come in.,63
NA,"I t is hardly fair to the committee, to the",63
NA,"Parliament, or to the Commonwealth to",63
NA,settle a big issue like this in a debate on a,63
NA,"subject like a Public Service Bill, which is",63
NA,primarily devoted to the determination of,63
NA,very different questions. I am' still in a,63
NA,"state of flux, so far as my mind is concerned,",63
NA,"on the matter, but I submit these considera-",63
NA,"tions, with the hope that other honor-",63
NA,able members may be able to help me to come,63
NA,I to a decision as to which way I should vote.,63
NA,"1Â° have still an open mind in the matter,",63
NA,but there are difliculties which I think i t is,63
NA,the bounden duty of the supporters of the,63
NA,proposal to remove before they can expect,63
NA,my support.,63
Sir EDWARDBRADD ON ,Tasmania).,63
NA,-Whe n we were on the second reading,63
NA,of this Bill I expressed the opinion that the,63
NA,assurance of civil servants of the Common-,63
NA,wealth should be undertaken by the,63
NA,"Commonwealth itself, directly, ancl not",63
NA,"through the assurance companies; and,",63
NA,"further, tbat, as is provided in exceptional in-",63
NA,"stances under clause 49, so should i t be",63
NA,"provided in all instances, that is to say,",63
NA,that the Commonwealth should be re-,63
NA,sponsible for the granting of satisfactory,63
NA,gratuities and allowances to all civil servants,64
NA,coining within the scope of these particular,64
NA,clauses ox their death or retirement from,64
NA,the service. Inasmuch as these clauses,64
NA,cannot embrace all the servants who are,64
NA,transferred to the Commonwealth at the,64
NA,"present time, who are specially exempted",64
NA,"under clause 43, I do not think we need",64
NA,apprehend any great difficulties from death or,64
NA,"disaster for some years to come, or before we",64
NA,have built up a fund upon which those re-,64
NA,tiring or the dependents of those dying may,64
NA,rely witli the assurance that they will get,64
NA,"the relief intended to be provided, for them. I",64
NA,"can see no serious objection to, but on the",64
NA,other hand I can see every good reason,64
NA,"for, the State subsidizing a fund of that",64
NA,sort in order to provide for the comfort of,64
NA,its own servants. I hope that any prospect,64
NA,of difficulty will not daunt us or prevent us,64
NA,"from passing the measure which, I beheve,",64
NA,will be attended with incalculable good to,64
NA,the servants of the Commonwealth. We,64
NA,have i n some of the States provision of this,64
NA,"sort already, and provision has been made",64
NA,in some way or other for the great,64
NA,majority of the servants of the trans-,64
NA,"ferred services, and I think i t now becomes",64
NA,our bounden duty to see tliat provision is,64
NA,made for tlieir future. I am afraid I am,64
NA,in disagreement with some of those who,64
NA,"favour this State assurance idea, inasmuch",64
NA,"as I . would, limit i t strictly to making pro-",64
NA,"vision for our own servants, aiid would not",64
NA,go to tbe general public for assistance,64
NA,"in establishing the' fund, and thus make",64
NA,the Commonwealth Government a general,64
NA,assurance company. I wonld limit i t solely,64
NA,to the operations necessary to be conducted,64
NA,on behalf of our own servants.,64
Mr OMALLEY , : The Commonwealth,64
NA,could re-insure.,64
Mr BATCHELOR ,South Australia) -,64
NA,Tho'se of us who favour the proposal of the,64
NA,"honorable member for Bourke, are very",64
NA,"glad to see"" i t meet with the support",64
NA,of the honorable member who has just,64
NA,spoken. Thehonorable and learned member,64
NA,"for Corinella told ns he was i n a dilemma,",64
NA,"and that be had not quite made up liis mind,",64
NA,and his principal trouble seemed to be that the,64
NA,proposed assurance fund was to be started,64
NA,in a small way. He would be more in-,64
NA,clined to give i t support i f we were going,64
NA,in for a national scheme. I would point,64
NA,"out, however, that there is an opposite way",64
NA,"of looking at the matter, and that while",64
NA,perhaps i t might be somewhat risky starting,64
NA,"an experiment, embracing the whole com-",64
NA,"munity, on a very large scale, i t would be",64
NA,comparatively safe to start i t on a small,64
NA,scale i n the way now proposed. I have,64
NA,come to tlie conclusion that the proposal is,64
NA,good enough for us to start with. Some,64
NA,objection was taken to our discussing this,64
NA,matter i n connexion with the present,64
NA,"measure. But i t seems to me that ""this is",64
NA,just the measure to which our present dis-,64
NA,cussion naturally belongs.,64
Mr VL SOLOMON ,Excep t that we,64
NA,have not any actuarial information to guide,64
NA,us.,64
Mr BATCHELOR , The honorable,64
NA,"member will admit that the scheme, as pro-",64
NA,"posed by the Government, ancl as stated by",64
NA,"the Attorney-General, is one which the",64
NA,assurance companies will accept. I t is said,64
NA,"to be actuarially sound, and therefore we",64
NA,have that much to go on. I f the scheme,64
NA,"itself is actuarially sound, and the private",64
NA,"companies are prepared to accept i t , what",64
NA,should there be to prevent the Government,64
NA,from taking i t up ? We know that a con-,64
NA,siderable percentage of the earnings of the,64
NA,"companies goes i n the way of expenses, i n",64
NA,"payment of agents' commissions, directors'",64
NA,"fees, cost of buildings, and so on.",64
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLIAN , B u t we must,64
NA,have a large volume of business i n order t o,64
NA,make our profits and reduce our percent-,64
NA,age of expenses.,64
Mr VL SOLOMON ,.N o Government,64
NA,scheme could get near the profits of the,64
NA,A.M.P. society.,64
Mr BATCHELOR ,Tha t is no argu-,64
NA,ment at all.,64
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLIAN ,Doe s not the,64
NA,honorable member allow that life assurance,64
NA,depends upon a certain number of people,64
NA,assuring i n order to make i t sound.,64
Mr BATCHELOR ," I will allow that,",64
NA,and in his turn the honorable member for,64
NA,AVentw orth must admit that all companies,64
NA,T,64
NA,have had to start with a small number of,64
NA,"lives, and probably at first made lossesas",64
NA,the result.,64
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLIAN,AV e had an,64
NA,unlimited area to work upon.,64
Mr BATCHELOR ,Th e assurance com-,64
NA,panies have built up their business owing to,64
NA,"the gradual accumulation of funds, and to",64
NA,"more and more people joining them, and",64
NA,the same results will follow under the,64
NA,scheme that is now proposed. There will,64
NA,be such a large number of policy holders to,64
NA,draw' upon.,64
Mr VL SOLOMON ,Ther e will be a very,65
NA,limited number.,65
Mr BATCHELOR , The honorable,65
NA,meinber does not know what the limits of,65
NA,the Commonwealth service will be.,65
Mr VL SOLOMON , I am hopeful that the,65
NA,number of people to be assured will not be,65
NA,anything like the numbers assured by the,65
NA,private companies -,65
Mr BATCHELOR , I t is not at all,65
NA,unlikely that other services beyond those,65
NA,already transferred will be taken over by,65
NA,"the. Commonwealth, - and this fund will",65
NA,"probably prove the nucleus of a very"" large",65
NA,scheme into which the outside public may,65
NA,"be eventually drawn, i f necessary. We are",65
NA,telling the public servants that they must,65
NA,"assure their lives, and if we require that",65
NA,they shall assure their lives with some of,65
NA,"the private companies, i t argues that the",65
NA,Government must guarantee the companies.,65
NA,We have no right to say to our servants,65
NA,that tliey must assure unless we are prepared,65
NA,to give a guarantee that tlieir pohcies will,65
NA,be met. I f we do have to guarantee these,65
NA,"companies, i t seems to me that we shall",65
NA,"ultimately have the responsibility, and that",65
NA,"being so, I think we ought to do the work",65
NA,itself. I t would be idle to say that the,65
NA,"Government should bear all the losses, but",65
NA,"that if there were any profits, they should go",65
NA,into the hands of the private companies.,65
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I want to know,65
NA,where is the guarantee ?,65
Mr VL SOLOMON ,Ther e is nothing in,65
NA,tlie Bill about that.,65
Mr BATCHELOR ,Thehonorabl e mem-,65
NA,ber for Macquarie is thirsting for informa-,65
NA,tion. W i l l he read the Bill 1 For when he,65
NA,was speaking just now i t seemed to me that,65
NA,he did not know quite so much about i t as,65
NA,he might have done. There is no provision,65
NA,"for a guarantee, but there ought to be.",65
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Th e honorable mem-,65
NA,ber said there was a guarantee.,65
Mr BATCHELOR , I did not say,65
NA,anything of tlie kind. I said that the effect,65
NA,of compelling publie servants to join an,65
NA,approved assurance company argued that we,65
NA,should have behind that company a guar-,65
NA,antee. I f the Government are going to,65
NA,"approve of a company, tliey ought also to",65
NA,guarantee the public servant-wh o on the,65
NA,faith of their approval joins the company-,65
NA,that i t shall pay in due course. There is no,65
NA,getting away from the logical position-a t,65
NA,"least, I tlunk not. What is at the back of",65
NA,private assurance companies 1 A t the best i t,65
NA,is the credit of a section of a community.,65
NA,"However sound they may be, the only thing",65
NA,"at the back of tliem is the credit, of a sec-",65
NA,tion of the community. What will be at,65
NA,the back of this scheme if i t is carried out 1,65
NA,The whole community. Does any one mean,65
NA,"to tell me that that can be less sound, less -",65
NA,"stable, less of a permanent guarantee to the",65
NA,public servant than the credit of ' a por-,65
NA,tion of the community. The whole credit,65
NA,of this vast continent is pledged to re-,65
NA,payment i n the event of the Government,65
NA,taking up . the scheme and carrying i t,65
NA,out. Therefore i t is absurd for any one to,65
NA,"suggest tliat i t miglit not be popular, that",65
NA,public servants might be compelled to go in,65
NA,"against tlieir will, when, as a matter of fact,",65
NA,they could not have. a liigher or better,65
NA,guarantee. Whatever may be the fate of,65
NA,this amendment I hope that the honorable,65
NA,member for Bourke will persevere. I am,65
NA,"quite sure that he ison the right track,",65
NA,"tliat State assurance is coming along, and",65
NA,that instead of borrowing money privately,65
NA,"and paying interest, the community will see",65
NA,the sense of lending the money to itself.,65
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I cannot say,65
NA,that I have not been interested in the,65
NA,"debate, for i t has be'en most interesting. I",65
NA,quite disagree with the assertion that there,65
NA,"would be any difficulty, or that tliere would",65
NA,"be any loss, i n reference to tliis proposal.",65
NA,I t is quite different of course from bringing,65
NA,in a proposal to deal with general assur-,65
NA,ance. I .admit tliat if i n New Soutli,65
NA,Wales the actuarial reports had given,65
NA,a proper basis for what approaches the pre-,65
NA,"sent proposal, the Superannuation Fund",65
NA,would not be so insolvent as i t is. I admit,65
NA,that there is nothing to prevent tliis thing,65
NA,"from being done, but i t is a very large",65
NA,"question, which I do not wish to see decided",65
NA,"in a hurried manner, either i n a very small",65
NA,committee or after a short debate. I f we,65
NA,postpone the consideration of this part of,65
NA,the Bill after the interesting debate which,65
NA,"we have had, and whicli has thrown con-",65
NA,"siderable light on the question, i t will give",65
NA,us a little more time to consider what is tlie,65
NA,"best course to take. .My own feeling, up to",65
NA,"the present time, has been strongly i n favour",65
NA,"of the provisions of the Bill, but I am quite",65
NA,"prepared to consider fairly this proposal,",65
NA,and therefore I shall ask for a postponement,65
NA,of Part IV . until we deal with the other,65
NA,parts of the Bill. I have applied to various,65
NA,assurance companies for information regard-,65
NA,"ing this matter, but I have not had any",65
NA,.replies. I want to have that information,66
NA,before I deal with the question in reply to already-,66
NA,tlie arguments which have been used to-,66
NA,o . .,66
NA,night. I think I am justified i n asking,66
NA,"a postponement, because the debate on",66
NA,this amendment has taken a turn which I,66
NA,was scarcely prepared for i t to take. I,66
NA,not speaking in any hostile spirit to the,66
NA,"honorable member for Bourke. I want to for,",66
NA,"deal ""fairly with tlie whole question, and",66
NA,therefore I move--,66
NA,That clauses 44 to 49 be postponed.,66
NA,Mr HUME COOK .(Bourke) -Th e,66
NA,Minister for Home Affairs was good,66
NA,to intimate to me privately a moment,66
NA,"ago that he intended to take this course,",66
NA,and during the few moments that have been such provision being made.,66
NA,available to me I have asked several,66
NA,who have taken a prominent part i n the,66
NA,"bate what tlieir view is, and whether",66
NA,should not agree to the request. We have dealt,66
NA,agreed that the consideration of the matter,66
NA,ought to be postponed in view of the turn,66
NA,which the debate has taken. The proposal,66
NA,can lose nothing at all by being fully diswith,66
NA,cussed. We think i t may very well stand,66
NA,on its merits. We have no desire to take a civil servants.,66
NA,snatch vote or to do anything to embarrass,66
NA,"the Government, or to make i t appear",66
NA,we were desirous of forcing the issue. I,66
NA,is only fair that we should agree that tlie,66
NA,Government should have a chance to get,66
NA,the information they can.,66
NA,further consideration we may arrive at what,66
NA,I trust will be a wise decision. Under these,66
NA,"circumstances, I have no opposition to offer",66
NA,to the postponement of the clause ; and,66
NA,am glad to say that I speak for a number,66
NA,those who are deeply interested i,66
NA,amendment.,66
Mr PIESSE ,Tasmania) - I would like,66
NA,to draw the Minister's attention to what,66
NA,seems to me incorrect i n theproposals as,66
NA,assurance. There is not sufficient provision,66
NA,made for 'the case of an officer leaving,66
NA,"children, or a. widow who would perhaps",66
NA,have to earn her living and support her,66
NA,children. I think i t would be well if,66
NA,Minister could take the matter into his,66
NA,purview and see whether some such provision,66
NA,as the words I have here written down may,66
NA,be acceptable i n place of sub-clauses (Â«),66
NA,(6) of clause 44-,66
NA,(a) The payment to him on his retirement,66
NA,from the service on attaining the prescribed,66
NA,"or on account oi illness or infirmity, or to his legal",66
NA,"representatives, such a sum as may be",66
NA,scribed.,66
NA,That will provide for what is i n the Bill,66
NA,"Or, alternately, for the payment to the oflicer,",66
NA,. .,66
NA,"or to his widow* or children, in place of such sum",66
NA,for such annuities as may be prescribed.,66
NA,So that there may be an opportunity of pro-,66
NA,viding fpr those cases which are sometimes,66
NA,am the most distressing of any where the de-,66
NA,pendents left are not at all properly provided,66
NA,and i t is desirable that some such provi-,66
NA,sion should be made. I only throw i t out as,66
NA,a suggestion for consideration by the,66
NA,Minister.,66
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I am glad that,66
NA,enough tlie honorahle member for Tasmania,66
NA,"or two has referred to this matter, because",66
NA,I have been strongly in favour of some,66
NA,I f the,66
NA,of those amendment of the honorable member,66
NA,defor Bourke is carried when i t comes on,66
NA,"we again, o* course this matter will not be",66
NA,"with j but, if i t is not carried, I intend",66
NA,either to agree to the proposal of the,66
NA,"honorable member for Tasmania, or to make",66
NA,a proposal which will coincide very much,66
NA,"it, because I think i t is a wise thing",66
NA,to provide for those who may be left by,66
Mr HARPER ,Mernda) -Ther e is,66
NA,that another element which the Minister for,66
NA,t Home Affairs ought to take into account and,66
NA,get information about. A t the present time-,66
NA,all civil servants have to be guaranteed by,66
NA,Perhaps on various guarantee associations. I think,66
NA,that business could be very profitably com-,66
NA,bined with the assurance clauses in this,66
NA,Bill. Therefore I suggest that we should,66
NA,I have a guarantee fund to which public,66
NA,of servants would contribute instead of paying,66
NA,n the into outside guarantee societies.,66
Sir WILLIAM LYSTE ,Le t i t go.,66
Mr VL SOLOMON ,South Australia).,66
NA,- I do not desire to intervene with-any idea,66
NA,"to of blocking debate at this stage, or to",66
NA,prevent the Minister from postponing these,66
NA,any clauses until we have had more time to,66
NA,consider them. I am glad to see that he,66
NA,has recognised the importance of getting,66
NA,"the further information, and before the",66
NA,clauses are again considered I would ask,66
NA,"him to get from some department, or from",66
NA,"an outside source, some actuarial information",66
NA,"and that will enable us to understand, whether,",66
NA,in the case of the Government starting an,66
NA,"assurance fund, they will be able to assure",66
NA,"age, on tlie same terms as ordinary mutual com-",66
NA,"prepanies, and what liability the Common-",66
NA,wealth will incur in regard to its servants.,66
NA,I t is all very well to point to companies like,67
NA,"the A.M.P. and a few others i n Australia,",67
NA,"which, with the whole continent to deal witli,",67
NA,have succeeded i n making very fair profits,67
NA,"for their assurers, who are all interested i n",67
NA,"them. But will the Government, in starting",67
NA,an assurance fund to deal with the few,67
NA,hundred or few thousand servants as the,67
NA,"case may be, be i n a position from the",67
NA,actuarial stand-point to give the same ad-,67
NA,vantages as to premiums as do any of those,67
NA,large companies-no t proprietary companies,67
NA,established to make money for directors and,67
NA,bonuses for shareholders-bu t mutual com-,67
NA,panies which have been established through-,67
NA,"out Australia, and which have attained to",67
NA,a splendid position ? Before the committee,67
NA,agrees to introduce into the Bill provisions,67
NA,whicli will enable the Government to become,67
NA,"assurers of civil, servants, I think that some",67
NA,actuarial expert knowledge on the subject,67
NA,should be obtained and given to the House.,67
NA,I think i t is important we should be i n that,67
NA,position. On a casual glance I am afraid,67
NA,we should be involving the Commonwealth,67
NA,"in perhaps immense liability, and I ask the",67
NA,Minister to inquire very closely into the,67
NA,matter and give us the fullest possible in-,67
NA,formation.,67
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I shall be very service,67
NA,happy to do so.,67
NA,Clause postponed.,67
NA,Clauses 45 to 49 postponed.,67
NA,Clause 50 agreed to.,67
NA,Clause 51.,67
NA,(a) Where a de|3artment of the public serpliance,67
NA,vice of a State,67
NA,"to the Commonwealth, every officer of",67
NA,such department who is retained,67
NA,"service of the Commonwealth, or",67
NA,"(b) where ""any officer in the public service",67
NA,a State is transferred to the public,67
NA,"service of the Commonwealth, every",67
NA,"oflicer so transferred,",67
NA,shall preserve all his existing and accruing,67
NA,and shall be entitled to retire from office,67
NA,time and on the pension or retiring allowance,67
NA,which would be permitted by the law of the,67
NA,from wliich he was transferred if his service,67
NA,the Commonwealth were a continuation of his,67
NA,service with such State.,67
Mr TUD OB ,Yarra) - I believe that,67
NA,Victoria at the present time there are,67
NA,. tain transferred officers to whom credit will,67
NA,not be given for having passed the clerical,67
NA,"examination, but who, if they had remained",67
NA,"in the State of Victoria, would have",67
NA,credited with having passed that examinapension,67
NA,tion. ' I f the position of these officers,67
NA,"satisfactory under the Commonwealth,",67
NA,"they the right to go back to the State service,",67
NA,and resume the positions they were i n when,67
NA,they left ?,67
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I think there,67
NA,is something in the statement by the honor-,67
NA,"able member, and the statement has, I",67
NA,believe been made before. I f the honorable,67
NA,"member will allow the clause to pass, I will",67
NA,inquire into the matter. I f I find any,67
NA,occasion to doubt that these men will retain,67
NA,all the rights that they have or should have,67
NA,at the present time i n consequence of any-,67
NA,"thing done by the Public Service Board, I",67
NA,shall have an amendment drafted to meet,67
NA,the case.,67
Mr PIESSE ,Tasmania) - I m o v e -,67
NA,That the following new sub-clause be added to,67
NA,the clause:-,67
NA,(2) In all cases of the transference of an officer,67
NA,from the public service of the Commonwealth to,67
NA,whom or to whose dependants under the laws of,67
NA,his State there would on his retirement from its,67
NA,public service or as the case may be upon his,67
NA,deatli become payable any pension retiring al-,67
NA,lowance or allowance tei dependents the,67
NA,amount of such pension retiring allowance,67
NA,ov allowance to dependents shall be payable,67
NA,by the Commonwealth ; but no appointment,67
NA,ol such an officer to the public service oi the Com-,67
NA,monwealth shall be made until the Governor in,67
NA,Council of his State shall have agreed to pay to,67
NA,thc Commonwealth a part of such amount to be,67
NA,calculated on the proportion which his term of,67
NA,with the State bears to the whole term of,67
NA,"service, aud for the purpose of the calculation his",67
NA,salary shall be taken to be that paid to him by,67
NA,the State at the time of the transfer.,67
NA,Provided that such an appointment may be,67
NA,made if the officer concerned agrees to forego the,67
NA,proportion of such amount which would in com-,67
NA,with the foregoing provisions be payable,67
NA,has become transferred by the State.,67
NA,in the I f honorable members will turn to section,67
NA,84 of tlie Constitution A c t they will see,67
NA,of that provision is there made i n regard to the,67
NA,transfer of officers. There is very ful l pro-,67
NA,vision with regard to the transfer of officers,67
NA,"rights who are i n transferred departments, such as",67
NA,"at the the post-office and the Defence department,",67
NA,State which have already been taken over by the,67
NA,with Commonwealth. A l l that is necessary both,67
NA,to secure those officers their rights and to,67
NA,provide for the apportionment of the pay-,67
NA,i n ment of any retiring allowances is there,67
NA,cerprovided. But when section S4 goes on to,67
NA,deal with officers who are not i n transferred,67
NA,"departments, but who are taken from the",67
NA,civil service of any State with any rights,67
NA,"been to pension, i t does not say how the",67
NA,is to be apportioned between the,67
NA,"is not State, who is the former emploj'er, and the",67
NA,"have Commonwealth, who is the new employer.",67
NA,"To get over the difficulty, I prepared the",67
NA,"sub-clause which I have just read, and",68
NA,.which in effecb enacts tliat the rights of,68
NA,all oflieers taken over shall be preserved as,68
NA,the clause provides; but that their pensions,68
NA,shall be apportioned between the Common-,68
NA,"wealth and the State i n every instance, in",68
NA,the same way as the Constitution already,68
NA,provides i n regard to transferred officers in,68
NA,transferred departments.,68
Mr MCCAY , Is the new,68
NA,improve the position of the,68
NA,oflieers1,68
NA,Mr DEAKIN; The oflicer is absolutely,68
NA,safe in any case.,68
Mr MCCAY , Then this is to protect the,68
NA,CommonAvealth ?,68
Mr DEAKIN ,"Yes , against the State.",68
Mr PIESSE ,An d to provide that the,68
NA,arrangement as to pensions shall not be in,68
NA,doubt between the State and tlie Common-,68
NA,Avealth. I beheve that i n regard to this neAv,68
NA,sub-clause there is some feeling that i t,68
NA,"exhibits over caution, but i f that is the only",68
NA,"objection, I think Ave had better be a little",68
NA,"over cautious than leaA'e i t open, even in a",68
NA,"small number of cases, for the question to",68
NA,arise between the State and tlie Common-,68
NA,Avealth as to AVIIO is to pay.,68
Mr MCCAY ,Doe s the honorable mem-,68
NA,ber think the Commonwealth Avould take,68
NA,officers over unless i t Avas knoAvn who had,68
NA,to pay the pensions ? .,68
Mr PIESSE ,"""Wha t I want to provide",68
NA,is that whoeA^er administers the Public Ser-,68
NA,vice A ct shall have a proArision there,68
NA,shoAving clearly the understanding as to IIOAV,68
NA,pensions are to be provided.,68
Mr DEAKIN , I haA'e been indebted,68
NA,on a number of occasions to the honorable,68
NA,member for calling attention to matters i n,68
NA,Avhich the drafting of the measure may be,68
NA,improved. This is another instance i n,68
NA,"which, if we were required to deal with a",68
NA,"question for the first time, I should not de-",68
NA,sire to see i t stated more clearly than the,68
NA,"honorable member has stated i t . But, after",68
NA,"all, we have the reply Avhich the honorable",68
NA,"membei eAridently expects, that this propo-",68
NA,-,68
NA,"sition is not necessary, and can be justi-",68
NA,fied only by a desire for abundant caution.,68
NA,But there is something more to consider.,68
NA,"If, as the honorable member said, he",68
NA,has a doubt Avhether the Constitution pro-,68
NA,vides for the payment by the State of that,68
NA,portion of tlie' pension vvhich Avould repre-,68
NA,sent the officers' State service-i f he has,68
NA,any doubt as to Avhether that is enforced by,68
NA,"the Constitution, IIOAV will he strengthen",68
NA,our position by tliis proposal ?,68
Mr PIESSE ,W e are not bound to take,68
NA,the officer-i t is voluntary.,68
Mr DEAKIN ,.The n that puts the,68
NA,matter on the ordinary and familiar ground,68
NA,"of a voluntary contract on both sides, and",68
NA,the honorable member has done service in,68
NA,calling attention to the possible necessity for,68
NA,"sub-clause to an arrangement. I admit that, although",68
NA,"transferred from my point of A iew, and i n my opinion,",68
NA,r,68
NA,the addition is unnecessary. The matter is,68
NA,"plain as i t stands, and the obligation rests",68
NA,"'. undoubtedly on the State. Having, after",68
NA,the honorable member's amendment was,68
NA,"tabled, carefullyreconsidered the position, I",68
NA,am still of the same mind as I Avas when I,68
NA,"originally spoke, and when he kindly called",68
NA,attention to this possible interpretation. I t,68
NA,"seems to me that, although the Avords i n",68
NA,section 8 i of the Constitution Act i n regard,68
NA,to State obligations are not repeated when,68
NA,officers are taken over by themselves and not,68
NA,"with tlieir Avhole department, yet the inten-",68
NA,tion of the section is clear. I do,68
NA,not think we can add anything to the,68
NA,clause. I do not think we hav e pOAver to,68
NA,r,68
NA,add anything by a provision which Avill be,68
NA,binding on the State i n this regard.,68
NA,The honorable member's proposal might,68
NA,serve the purpose of still further en-,68
NA,forcing on the Executive the necessity of,68
NA,"making some such arrangement, and he",68
NA,has served that purpose by moving the,68
NA,amendment and calling attention to the,68
NA,matter i n the way he has done.,68
Mr HUME COOK ,Bourke) -Several,68
NA,of the civil servants AVIIO have been trans-,68
NA,ferred from the State service to the Com-,68
NA,monwealth anticipate tliat they may get,68
NA,some increase in their salaries in the service,68
NA,of the Commonwealth. The question agi-,68
NA,tating their minds is-on what basis will,68
NA,their pensions be paid; Will it be on the,68
NA,increased rate of wages paid in the service of,68
NA,"the Commonwealtli, or on the rate they Avere",68
NA,receiving Avhen transferred to the Common-,68
NA,wealth ? If pensions are to be paid on the,68
NA,"increased rate, I would like to ask, for my",68
NA,"OAvn information, who makes good the differ-",68
NA,"ence, the CommonAvealth or the State 1",68
Mr DEAKIN , I f the honorable mem-,68
NA,ber Avill look at the Constitution A ct he will,68
NA,see that there is not the slightest ground,68
NA,for apprehension. The Constitution plainly,68
NA,says that any such officer shall be entitled,68
NA,to the pension or retiring aUowance Avhich,68
NA,Avould be permitted by the laAv of the State,68
NA,if his services.with the Commonwealtli were,69
NA,a continuation of. his.services.with the State.,69
NA,No words oould possibly be plainer than,69
NA,"these. The pension i n the case of Victoria,",69
NA,"for instance, will be on the salaries the",69
NA,officers were receiving i n their last three,69
NA,years in tlieservice of -the Commonwealth.,69
Mr HIGGI NS ,Northern Melbourne) -,69
NA,The new sub-clause proposed by the honor-,69
NA,".able and learned member for Tasmania, Mr,",69
NA,"Piesse, simply means that i f a man were, for",69
NA,"instance, transferred from the Lands depart-",69
NA,ment of Victoria or Tasmania to the service,69
NA,"of tho Commonwealth, i t is made clear that",69
NA,the State is to .pay his .pension and not the,69
NA,Commonwealth.,69
Mr PIESSE ,.Th e State's proportion of,69
NA,the pension.,69
Mr HIGGINS , The honorable and,69
NA,learned member admitted that the point is,69
NA,clear in regard to officers of transferred de-,69
NA,"partments, but he thinks i t is not clear in",69
NA,the Constitution with regard to au officer,69
NA,whose department is not transferred. I have,69
NA,looked at the thing very closely and I,69
NA,think i t would be a mistake to accept this,69
NA,amendment. The Attorney-General has the,69
NA,"right view of section 84, namely, that tlie",69
NA,obligation will remain with the State and,69
NA,will not go to the Commonwealth. But I,69
NA,say also that i f the obligation .is not placed,69
NA,"by tho Constitution on tlie State, tlie Com-",69
NA,monwealth cannot impose that obligation.,69
' Mr PIESSE ,Th e .amendment is not to,69
NA,do that; the amendment merely says that,69
NA,we shall not take the officers unless we make,69
NA,the arrangement.,69
Mr HIGGINS ,The n the honorable,69
NA,and learned member wants to prohibit the,69
NA,"power, which is already i n the Constitution,",69
NA,of the Commonwealth-'Government to take,69
NA,over a man at its discretion.,69
Mr PIESSE , The Commonwealth Govern-,69
NA,ment .are to be at liberty to signify the oon-,69
NA,ditiona.,69
Mr HIGGINS ,Bu t if thc honorablcand,69
NA,"learned member'signifies the conditions, he",69
NA,"prohibits - conditionally,-and I do -not see we",69
NA,have the power to restrain by an A c t not,69
NA,"only the present Government, but future",69
NA,Governments from doing that which the,69
NA,Constitution says .they can do.,69
Mr MCLEAN ,Gippsland) - I find,69
NA,that in the departments transferred to the,69
NA,Commonwealth there are some young men,69
NA,who 'have passed the necessary examination,69
NA,entitling them to appointment in the,69
NA,"clerical division of the State service, but.",69
NA,[113],69
NA,who have not yet been .appointed to that,69
NA,division. W i l l these men ;be .entitled to,69
NA,receive appointments in the clerical division,69
NA,of the Commonwealth service without,69
NA,undergoing .a fresh examination?,69
Mr DEAKIN ,Yes .,69
Mr POYNTON ,South Australia) - I,69
NA,would like to direct the attention of the,69
NA,Attorney-General to this particular clause,69
NA,"iu its relation to clause-29, the consideration",69
NA,of which has been postponed. I f i t is un-,69
NA,derstood that the definition in clause 29 is,69
NA,"to be broadened, then -this clause -will also",69
NA,need to be. altered. .Lost night I moved an,69
NA,amendment having reference to the rail-,69
NA,way servico .,69
Mr DEAKIN ,"Tha t will be consequential,",69
NA,certainly.,69
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ,Went-,69
NA,worth) - I wish to draw the Attorney-.,69
NA,"General's attention to an anomaly whicli, I",69
NA,"am afraid, will give rise to a great deal o f",69
NA,"heart-burning i n the service, but for whicli I",69
NA,do uot quite see. a remedy. The clause pro- -,69
NA,vides that an officer transferred from the -,69
NA,service of a State shall have his existing,69
NA,and accruing rights preserved to him. I n,69
NA,New South Wales we have-a certain arrange-,69
NA,ment by which an officer pays so much -per,69
NA,annum to attain .a certain right at -the end,69
NA,"of his,service. I n Victoria -.the same right,",69
NA,is Tat tained without any payment at all.,69
' Mr DEAKIN ,No t since' 1880 in Victoria..,69
- Sir WILLIAM , MCMILLAN - I n one.,69
NA,"case there is a .scale on a -3 per cent,",69
NA,"basis, while.in another i t is 4.per oent. I t .",69
NA,seems to me that i t might'be right and,69
NA,generous on the part of the - Common-,69
NA,wealth to consider -whether some scheme,69
NA,could not be worked out by which this,69
NA,disparity .should cease' to exist -I think i t,69
NA,would make the public service more .easy,69
NA,:,69
NA,"and prevent much heartburning df a scheme,",69
NA,"were .adopted by which, where the -burden is.",69
NA,"at present heavier, i t might - be reduced to-",69
NA,on average.,69
Mr DEAKIN ,Ballarat - Attorney-,69
NA,General) - I understand that under the,69
NA,New South Wales law certain offioers. pay,69
NA,"4. per cent, towards a superannuation fund.",69
NA,"I n Victoria no .such..principle, obtains, be-",69
NA,cause .under the existing.law. the .State no,69
NA,longer provides -for retiring .allowances.,69
NA,The only public servants in Victoria,69
NA,who are entitled to retiring .aUowances or,69
NA,pensions are those who joined the service,69
NA,"before 1880. Of course, some of these",69
NA,officers remain .although more than twenty,69
NA,years have elapsed. I f any of them have,70
NA,been transferred to the Commonwealth they,70
NA,may be working side by side''with others,70
NA,-whose existing and accruing rights will be,70
NA,preserved to them only on the condition that,70
NA,they pay their 4 per cent. Since 1880 the,70
NA,"""Victorian Government have made arrange-",70
NA,ments for the life insurance of members of,70
NA,the civil service. The employes themselves,70
NA,pay towards thc life insurance.,70
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ,,70
NA,scale ?,70
Mr DEAKIN , I do not know that. To,70
NA,the best insurance companies tliey probably,70
NA,"pay 4 per cent., but to others they may pay",70
NA,more. A l l our Victorian.officers since 1880,70
NA,are providing for their own future. I t,70
NA,will only be in connexion with the long,70
NA,"sendee men, who joined tbe service",70
NA,"before 1880, tliat tho discrepancy which",70
NA,the honorable member for Wentworth has,70
NA,"spoken of, will arise. But even that is one of",70
NA,the discrepancies which i t may bc possible,70
NA,"for the commissioner in the course of time,",70
NA,when he has a view of the circumstances of,70
NA,".all the States, to harmonize.",70
Mr E SOLOMON ,Fremantle) -I,70
NA,would ask the Attorney-General,70
NA,clause provides merely for transferred,70
NA,officers 1 Assuming that officers had been in,70
NA,tlie public service of tho States perhaps for,70
NA,"eight or nine years, and were not entitled",70
NA,to a pension until they had been there ten,70
NA,"years, would any compensation be given to-",70
NA,them if they were not transferred to the,70
NA,"Commonwealth, but were dismissed from",70
NA,the service of the Government?,70
NA,any compensation whatever be given to,70
NA,them for loss of office? In thc event of,70
NA,.'any public servant not being,70
NA,will the Government consider the advisa-,70
NA,-bility of giving him some compensation for,70
NA,Joss of office 1,70
Mr DEAKIN ,Ballarat-Attorney -,70
NA,- General) -Tha t is provided for. I f the,70
NA,honorable member refers to section 84 of,70
NA,thc Constitution Act he will find i t is thero,70
NA,provided that-,70
NA,Any sucli officer who is not retained in the ser-,70
NA,"vice of tho Commonweallh shall, unless he is",70

NA,"ment in the public service of the State, be entitled",70
NA,"to receive from tho State any pension, gratuity,",70
NA,"or other compensatiou, payable under the law of",70
NA,the State on the abolition of his office.,70
Mr E SOLOMON , B u t I wish to,70
NA,point out that i t may happen tliat,70
NA,there is no compensation provided for undor,70
NA,the State law. W i l l thc Government regard,70
NA,the length of service that has been devoted,70
NA,"to the State, and take the matter of com-",70
NA,pensation into consideration irrespective of,70
NA,what the law may be upon the subject?,70
NA,"Otherwise, I believe that in some cases",70
NA,"officers would receive no compensation, even",70
NA,although they had been in the State service,70
NA,for several years. These cases I should like,70
NA,to be considered by the Commonwealth.,70
Mr DEAKIN ,S o far I have not heard,70
NA,On what of any such case as the honorable member sug-,70
NA,"gests liaving occurred, nor do I think i t is",70
NA,likely to occur. I f i t does i t is one of those,70
