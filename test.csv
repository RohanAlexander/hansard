 would ask the Attorney-General                if this
 clause provides         merely for transferred
 officers 1 Assuming that officers had been in
 tlie public service of tho States perhaps for
 eight or nine years, and were not entitled
 to a pension until they had been there ten
 years, would any compensation be given to-
 them if they were not transferred to the
 Commonwealth,        but were dismissed from
 the service of the Government?                  Would
 any compensation whatever be given to
 them for loss of office? In thc event of
.'any public servant not being            transferred,
