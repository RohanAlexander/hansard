# Analysis of Australian Hansard

This contains the scripts and related material that I am putting together for a text analysis of Australian Hansard. The data doesn't seem to be able to be included in this repo, but please get in touch if you are interested.

To start, download the XML files of Hansard from 1901 to 1980. Unpack them, and then run the get_data_from_xml_to_dataframe.R file to convert to a dataframe. 

Notes:

- Update Patrick Gorman's birthday
- Michael Danby to retire at next election - update that division at next election
- Emma Husar to retire at next election - update that division at next election
- ACT redistribution - from 2 to 3 seats - update those divisions at next election
