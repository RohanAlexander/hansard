          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. POYNTON</inline>(South Australia).Following up the questions which have been, asked in regard to the construction of a., telegraph line to Tarcoola, I wish to bring&#34;; certain facts under the notice of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, and will, in conclusion, ask a question. I find that a battery has been in operation on the field for something like a month, and that  the stone crushed amounts to 566 tons, fora yield of 1,164 ounces of gold. I understand,, further, , that it is expected that somethinglike - 1 10dwts.  of gold per ton will be&#39; extracted from, the tailings by the cyanide process. I might&#39;  also .inform the Minister that there,  tire  something like 2,000 telegraph poles at Oodnadatta, and that these would go a long way towards the construction of the telegraph line to that field, which is very much re-  -quired. I would ask the Minister whether the .Government, will hurry on the erection of this telegraph line as much as .possible. </para>

I think the information which has just been conveyed is very much like that previously  communicated to the House, but if it is fuller it will go further in supporting the purpose of the Government, which is to review the circumstances at the earliest possible moment ; and if they find that the work is warranted, to at once proceed with its construction. </para>

          <para>- In view of what passed in the Legislative Council of the State  of Victoria last evening, I would ask the Prime Minister when it may  j  be expected that the matter of the occupation of these buildings by tho Federal Parliament will bc finally settled <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Something like three months have passed without any definite agreement having been arrived at, and it -is quite intelligible, in view of the peculiar circumstances of the case, that the Victorian Parliament should feel aggrieved if any reasonable requirements of theirs are not met. This is a matter which I do not think should be allowed to drag on longer than is absolutely necessary. It is stated that the agreement between the Premier of Victoria and the Prime Minister has not yet been ratified, and I hope that some arrangement will be made at the earliest possible moment, and that as far as practicable the requirements of the members of the Victorian Parliament -will be met- </para>

            <para>- Under that correspondence - whatever may have happened since by way of any variation or desire of variation - this Parliament occupies this build- | ing. When it became a question of the vacation of these premises, certain difficulties arose which I fully explained to honorable members, and which, of course, resulted in some cases, in reluctance to vacate places which had been occupied for a series of years. As I explained to honorable members, that reluctance was only natural. As an outcome of that, some conversation took place between the Premier of Victoria and myself, at which the  Speaker  of the Victorian Assembly was present, and some other officer - I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins,</inline> who for some time occupied the position of Chief  Clerk  in this House. During that conversation, for the sake of avoiding friction, and for the sa,ke of doing what I knew this  j  Parliament would approve, so as to make the transition as light as passible to our <inline font-style="italic">confreres</inline> of the Victorian Parliament, there were certain matters which were tentatively agreed to by me. About the end of April, or towards the end of April, executive resolutions were passed by the Government of the Commonwealth asking to&#39; be permitted to .borrow from the Government of Victoria certain staffs attached to the Houses. These matters were assented to by executive minute on the part of the Government of Victoria a month or two afterwards - I think it was more like two months than one. I am trying to make- as succinct a statement of these facts as I can from memory. .There were other matters of detail that -were also arranged, and the agreement -was approved of, I think, hy the Executive Council of the State of Victoria, and tendered to me for the acceptance of the Commonwealth. In it I found what seemed to me to be matters, introduced by way of modification, which took the affair quite outside anything upon which there had been any personal agreement, and these were the subject of some consideration by the Federal. Cabinet.  There was -much intervening correspondence,  and before that consideration had resulted in any agreement with the Government of Victoria certain further terms were asked for by the Government of Victoria, including the entire control of the Library. It seemed to me that this created a situation that called for a conference between the Premier of Victoria and myself, and I accordingly asked him to meet me, which he did. He with very great gladness assented to the proposition that the Speakers and Presidents of the Federal and State Parliaments should meet in conference and endeavour to settle the matter, the understanding being that they should report to the Premier of Victoria and myself. At the same time I had considerable confidence that the deliberations of these high officers would enable us all to arrive at a satisfactory agreement. I was under the impression that that was to be carried out, but on asking again whether it was to be carried out or not, I received a letter - I will speak again from memory, as I have not the correspondence in front of me - in which the Premier of Victoria suggested that in lieu of that conference between the Speakers and Presidents, there should be a conference between the two Atorneys-General. My honorable friend, the Premier of Victoria, pointed out that the word &#34;settled&#34; had been used in reference to the proposed conference of Speakers and Presidents as if their deliberations were to settle the matter. My reply to that was that although I had expressed entire confidence that they would settle the matter, I had not proposed that the Governments should be absolutely bound by their recommendations, but that there should be a report from them, and that I was still willing that the matter should be submitted to their consideration. I made this statement to the honorable gentleman : That before I could agree to entertain any proposal that the two Attorneys-General should consider the matter between them, I wished to know definitely whether he withdrew from his acceptance of my former proposal, that the Presidents ; and the Speakers of the two Houses in each case should meet to consider the matter, adding that I was perfectly willing, as always, that that meeting should be for consideration and report to the respective . Governments. Within the last few days I have received a letter from the Premier of Victoria telling me that he does withdraw his adoption of that proposed arrangement, so that the matter now remains in this position - That whilst the points of difference are still outstanding there is a proposal from the Government of Victoria that the Attorneys-General of the respective Governments shall consider the matter. That is a question upon which I intend to take the opinion of Cabinet on the very first opportunity that the present press of business allows. But whatever has delayed the settlement of this matter, it is certainly not any action on the part of the Commonwealth, which has sedulously exhibited its desire all through that there should be an amicable arrangement. Notwithstanding the fact that the whole building was placed at its disposal and accepted with all that it contained, it has been ready to consent to modifications rather than that there should be friction between the two Parliaments and Governments. It is with reluctance that I make this statement, but the time has come for me to make it, and the time has come for the public of Victoria to appreciate the position under which the Commonwealth is labouring. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HIGGINS</inline>(Northern Melbourne)..I would suggest that the honorable member for Echuca should accept the suggestion of the Minister, because it is not convenient in an interpretation clause to make what is substantially a new enactment. If the clause as proposed be carried we have the statement of the Minister that the clause shall be recommitted. There are a few definitions which honorable members and the public may find it hard to understand the advantage of. For instance, the word &#34;feints&#34; is- &#34;Feints&#34; means - spirits received into the feints receiver. </para>
        <para class="block">I am not sure that that definition gives us very much more light on the subject, and it reminds me that when on one occasion there was a discussion in the House of Commons as to what were the duties of an archdeacon, the expert in ecclesiastical law replied to those who required information that an archdeacon was one who fulfilled archidiaconal functions. No doubt this definition of &#34; feints &#34; may convey light to some persons, but I should like to have some better explanation of it. </para>
