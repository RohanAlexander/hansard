Line 1691710
- Case 1
- Should be merged into the line above - it's a continuation and there's nobody else speaking in between. There's no reason for the statement to not be part of the statement in the line above.
- statement_type for 1691709 is talk.start and then statement_type for 1691710 is para. 


Line 1691722
- Case 1


Line 1691724
- Case 2
- Should be attributed to the person in 1691722, because it's a response to an interjection in 1691723.
- statement_type for 1691724 is para, statement_type for 1691723 is interjection and statement_type for 1691722 is para.


Line 1691738
- Case 1

Line 1691739
- Case 1, slight variant
- statement_type for 1691737 is talk.start, statement_type for 1691738 is para, and statement_type for 1691739 is para. 
- All three should be merged into one line.
- This slight variant on case 1 would be picked up by the same code running through twice, although probably faster to code it into the one run through.


Line 1691750
- Case 2, slight variant where the statement_type is slightly different.
- Should be attributed to the person in 1691748, because it's a response to an interjection in 1691749.
- statement_type for 1691748 is talk.start, statement_type for 1691749 is interjection and statement_type for 1691750 is para.


Line 1691770
- Case 3
- Should be attributed to the person in 1691769 as it's a quote and doesn't need to be its own statement, but would be best to add within quotation marks.
- statement_type for 1691770 is quote and for 1691769 is talk.start


Line 1691771
- Case 3, slight variant
- Should be attributed to the person in 1691769 as it's a quote and doesn't need to be its own statement, but would be best to add within quotation marks. The one above it is a quote.
- statement_type for 1691771 is quote, statement_type for 1691770 is quote, and for 1691769 is talk.start


Line 1691769
