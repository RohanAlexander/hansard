   The night that this report was released the     The following day the Treasurer went on to,55
Treasurer appeared on a. national radio pro-    say that these bills would be split. He made,55
"gram on the ABC, PM, saying that he had          some other remarks and it is those remarks",55

where risk might exist and whether there was     addressing. He was asked by a journalist,55
anything we could do to minimise that risk.      whether he felt somewhat betrayed by the,55
What kind of a disgrace is that? There had       Labor senators in this situation. I think that,55
been a constitutional cloud of doubt over this   question goes to the heart of what Senate,55
,55
committees are all about and the Treasurer's         than to suggest that they will come into this,56
"response goes to the heart of how he, and            place and simply, on all occasions, sing the",56
"probably other members of this government,           tune of their respective parties, whatever the",56
think Senate committees should behave. The           risk to the nation.,56
question was:                                           But that is apparently what this Treasurer,56
"Do you feel somewhat betrayed by Labor senators      expects. This petulant, failed Treasurer, who",56
"in this situation?                                   chose to package the bill in this way, some-",56
The inference being that Labor senators on           how believes that a Senate committee should,56
the other side of the chamber will always do         simply endorse what a bill says and that it has,56
in committees as they are instructed; that they      no business in questioning his choice to,56
have no regard for the truth; no regard for          package the bill in this way. The Treasurer is,56
what the proper story is that should be put          not that informed. He went on to say that,56
"before parliament; and, if there is any diffi-      only one sentence in the report includes any",56
"culty created in a report, then they will not        sense of wisdom. And I thought Senator",56

reports that make it easy for the Treasurer.         ing people I have ever met!,56
"That was the inference to be drawn from the             Mr Dawkins said, 'Only one sentence in the",56
"question and, of course, it was a very well          report includes any sense of wisdom'. The",56
placed question because the response was:            Treasurer can glean nothing out of the re-,56
"I could not, in polite language, describe how I feel port-all the work that has been done, all the",56
"about the members of that Committee, including       evidence that has been given by people who",56
those from my own party.                             are both wellintentioned and well-informed.,56
So the Treasurer is saying that the members          Some of them came to opinions that were,56

should have ignored the advice that they were        work had been done and all the Treasurer,56

that we are feeble-minded people who cannot        that the reaction of the Treasurer tells us,58
consider a number of issues at one time.           something. It teJIs us that the Treasurer is,58
   He completely bypassed the very important       under pressure and that he is a man who,58
point that what we do in this chamber with         behaves badly when he is under pressure. He,58
respect to bills and how we deal with them-       comes out on the attack rather than accepting,58

"the way in which we might amend them-is            find a resolution to the problem, believes the",58
quite clearly indicated to us by the constitu-    Senate should ignore what the constitutional,58
tion. We probably all appreciate that the way      restraints are on parliament and also believes,58
that we deal with them if we get it wrong is       the Senate should ignore the reasons why,58

important is that section 55 of the constitu-     pass legislation as he wants.,58
