 They may argue they represent a greater number of,61

 Again: .                                             that the detailed provision has obviously not,61

 That is Mr Kennett's view. And what indeed           drafting will depend upon that.,61
" does the opposition think about their state             What will be provided, on the model set out",61

So Mr Kennett obviously concedes the point           another indication of how basically peculiar,61
