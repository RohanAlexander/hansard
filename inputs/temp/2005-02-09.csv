   Senator Coonan-As this question deals with matters that are the responsibility of the,170
"Australian Taxation Office, I have asked the Commissioner for advice. The advice in relation",170
to the honourable senator's question is as follows:,170
(1) to (6) The secrecy provisions of the tax laws prevent the disclosure of information relating to the,170
     taxation affairs of a particular organisation to a third party. Any organisation that is dissatisfied,170
     with a decision made by the Tax Office not to endorse it as a public benevolent institution (PBI) is,170
     entitled to have the decision reviewed.,170
     On 4 June 2003 the Tax Office issued public ruling TR 2003/5 which discusses public benevolent,170
     institutions. The ruling states that a public benevolent institution (PBI) is a non-profit institution,170
"     organised for the direct relief of such poverty, sickness, suffering, distress, misfortune, disability,",170
"     destitution, or helplessness as arouses compassion in the community. The ruling also states that it is",170
     not sufficient that an organisation's operations be directed towards categories of people who could,170
     be in need of relief. Rather it must be for the relief of suffering and distress experienced by those,170
     people.,170
     The ruling goes on to say that the organisation must be at least predominantly for the direct relief,170
"     of such poverty, sickness, suffering, distress, misfortune, disability, destitution, or helplessness.",170
     TR 2003/5 is based on a collection of current judicial knowledge that has developed from many,170
     court decisions over a very considerable time frame. When deciding whether an organisation is,170
     predominantly for the provision of benevolent relief it is a matter of fact and degree. It is an objec-,170
     tive question which will involve the weighing of all relevant factors and both the organisation's,170
     constitution and its day-to-day activities are relevant.,170
"     As it is the character and purpose of the organisation that must be ascertained, a solely quantitative",170
     measurement would be inadequate. If an organisation has two or more objectives that are roughly,170
"     equal and only one involves the provision of benevolent relief, then the organisation could not be",170
     accepted as a public benevolent institution.,170

"(5) Taking into account the precautionary principle, can the Government guarantee that no adverse",171
"    human health effects result from living in close proximity to telecommunications towers; if so, why",171
    has the Government allocated further funding for on-going research into potential health risks from,171
    electro-magnetic emissions devices and phone towers.,171
   Senator Coonan-The response is based in part on advice received from Telstra. The an-,171
swer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:,171
(1) The decision to appeal the decision by the West Tamar Council is a matter for Telstra.,171
"    Although Telstra remains partially Government-owned, it has been an independent corporation",171
    since 1991. Telstra's Board and management are responsible for the day to day running of the com-,171
    pany's operations. The Government's role is to establish the legislative framework within which all,171
    telecommunications service providers (including Telstra) must operate. Consequently the Govern-,171
    ment is unable to intervene with respect to operational issues or disputes that arise from the con-,171
    duct of Telstra's daily business.,171
"    Approvals for most telecommunications facilities, including the majority of mobile telecommuni-",171
"    cations towers, are dealt with by relevant State and Territory authorities, usually at the local level.",171

"    tion, and are subject to the local planning processes.",171
    State or Territory legislation may make provision for appeals against a Council decision.,171
"(2) The location of mobile phone towers, including the consideration of alternative sites is a commer-",171
"    cial matter for Telstra to determine, consistent with the Tasmanian State planning legislation.",171
    Telstra advised that a mediation conference was held with concerned residents on 26 February,171
    2004. Telstra explained the sites it reviewed as options for the mobile phone tower and outlined,171
    the precautionary approach it used in selecting the Bindaree Road site as the best option for Tel-,171
"    stra's facility. Telstra also listened to site suggestions put forward by others at the meeting, but said",171
    that these options did not meet the mobile coverage objectives for the site.,171
(3) The Government's framework for the telecommunications sector seeks to achieve a reasonable,171
    balance between individual local and broader regional and national interests. Through its reform of,171
"    the telecommunications sector, the Government has sought to encourage competition to give Aus-",171
"    tralians greater access to a wide range of high quality, low cost telecommunications services. Ap-",171
"    provals for the installation of most telecommunications facilities, however, are dealt with at the lo-",171
"    cal level. In particular, State and Territory legislation covers the installation of mobile phone tow-",171
    ers. This arrangement ensures that the rollout of modern telecommunications networks is encour-,171
"    aged, while taking into account individual communities' local concerns and interests.",171
"    It is impractical for the Government to legislate at a micro-level all telecommunications activities,",171
    both due to the technical nature of the industry and the cost. Encouraging good industry practice,171
    through self-regulatory mechanisms such as industry codes of practice and technical standards is an,171
    important strategy.,171
    The Government has encouraged the telecommunications industry to develop and implement the,171
    Australian Communications Industry Forum (ACIF) Deployment of Radiocommunications Infra-,171
"    structure Code (the Industry Code), that provides for additional consultation arrangements for low-",171
    impact facilities and some improved methods for addressing concerns about electromagnetic en-,171
    ergy (EME) emission levels for all radiocommunication facilities installed under Commonwealth,171
    and State and Territory laws. The Industry Code requires carriers to have regard to ‘community,171
    sensitive locations' such as residential areas when locating telecommunication facilities.,171

,171
(4) Placement of a telecommunications tower within the constraints of the relevant state planning leg-,172
"    islation and the industry code, is a commercial matter for carriers.",172
    Regulatory arrangements do not discourage carriers from installing their infrastructure on towers,172
"    belonging to other carriers, or on public infrastructure such as electricity towers. Indeed, carriers",172
    are required to consider opportunities for co-locating new telecommunications facilities on any ex-,172
"    isting tower or public utility structure, and it is the Government's long-standing policy to encour-",172
    age carriers to co-locate where possible.,172
(5) The Government recognises there is some concern in the Australian community about the possibil-,172
    ity of long-term effects on health of exposure to electromagnetic energy (EME) emissions used in,172
"    mobile telephony. The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA),",172
"    within the Health and Ageing portfolio, sets the standard for public occupational limits of exposure",172
    to radiofrequency emissions.,172
"    The ACA, in conjunction with ARPANSA, has recently launched an information package on EME",172
    and mobile phones. All the information in the package can be accessed through the website at,172
    http://emr.aca.gov.au.,172
    The Government has provided $4.5 million over four and a half years for the Radiofrequency Elec-,172

(4) Has any settlement been reached between Telstra and each of the original complainants in relation,172
    to the communication problems which were the basis of the inquiry.,172
   Senator Coonan-The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:,172
(1) Telstra has advised that it paid the fees of the two arbitrators and of the financial and technical re-,172
    source units assisting the arbitrators. Telstra has advised that it had a considerable number of inter-,172
    nal staff engaged in responding to the various Freedom of Information Act requests and directions,172
    from the arbitrators that Telstra produce documents. Telstra also engaged the services of external,172
    solicitors and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu to assist in the preparation of Telstra's defences. As the,172
"    arbitrations occurred between 1994 and 1999, Telstra advises that it has been unable to estimate the",172
    amount expended on these various activities.,172
"(2) Telstra has advised that the claims of the sixteen COTs, including the ‘original' COTs ( Mrs Garms,",172
"    Mrs Gillan, Mr Schorer and Mr Smith), were resolved by arbitrator's award or negotiated settle-",172

     damages or the setting aside of that award.,173
(4) Telstra has advised that the basis of the claims by the COTs was financial loss suffered by them as,173

(1) Why do employees have to wait until the October after the end of each financial year to find out,173
     whether or not their employer has made superannuation contributions.,173
(2) Why can employees not opt to have their employer pay superannuation contributions monthly or,173

   Senator Coonan-As the question deals with matters administered by the Australian Taxa-,173
"tion Office, I have asked the Commissioner of Taxation for advice. The advice in relation to",173
the honourable senator's question is as follows:,173
(1) From 1 July 2003 employers have been required to report to their employees the amount of super-,173
     annuation contributions made on their behalf within 30 days of the final contribution being made,173
     for all employees for that quarter. It is proposed to remove this reporting obligation from employers,173
     from 1 July 2005 as many employers report more frequently by including information pertaining to,173
     superannuation contributions on payslip advices.,173
     The obligation to include superannuation information on pay slips is contained throughout various,173
     Australian workplace legislation as well as State and Federal awards. As a result of the widespread,173
"     requirements to report superannuation contributions on payslips, combined with the requirement",173

(1) I am aware that 3rd Generation (3G) mobile telecommunications towers are currently being in-,177
     stalled throughout Australia. The location of these facilities is a commercial decision for carriers,177
"     which must comply with the appropriate Commonwealth, State or Territory legislation.",177
                                      QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,177
,177
(2) I am aware of the conclusions of the UK independent Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation,178
    report released in January 2004 titled ‘Health effects from Radiofrequency Electromagnetic,178
    Fields'.,178
    The report also concluded that the weight of evidence now available does not suggest that there are,178
    adverse health effects from exposures to radiofrequency fields below guideline levels.,178
"    In relation to mobile base stations, the report concluded: “Exposure levels from living near to mo-",178
"    bile base stations are extremely low, and the overall evidence indicates that they are unlikely to",178
    pose a risk to health.”,178
(3) The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) has the primary role,178
"    of advising the Government and providing information to the public, on issues related to radiation",178
    protection and developing standards for public occupational limits of exposure to radio frequency,178
    emissions. The Australian Communications Authority (ACA) has introduced regulations that make,178
"    mandatory, for radiocommunications transmitters, the electromagnetic energy (EME) emissions",178
    limits set out in a standard developed by ARPANSA. The ACA is also required to conduct random,178
"    audits to ensure licensees and suppliers are complying with the new EME regulations. Additionally,",178
    under the Australian Communications Industry Forum (ACIF) Deployment of Radiocommunica-,178
"    tions Infrastructure Code (the Industry Code), the public can request, at any time, that a carrier",178
    provide information on radiation levels around telecommunications facilities.,178
    Local Councils have control under relevant State or local planning schemes for all telecommunica-,178
    tions installations except those – generally low-impact facilities – covered by Schedule 3 to the,178
    Telecommunications Act 1997 (the Act). The location of these facilities is a commercial decision,178
    for carriers and is a matter between the carriers and the owner/occupier of the land on which the fa-,178
    cility is installed.,178
    Carriers seeking to install low-impact facilities are required to comply with rules of conduct set out,178
    in the Act and the Telecommunications Code of Practice 1997 (the Code). There are strict rules,178
"    governing what can be installed, where new infrastructure can be installed, notification require-",178
    ments and how carriers must behave. Compliance with the Act and the Code are standard carrier li-,178
    cence conditions. Alleged breaches of carrier licence conditions should be reported to the ACA.,178
    Only a court can make a determinative ruling on the interpretation of the Telecommunications,178
    (Low-Impact Facilities) Determination 1997 (the Determination) and whether a facility complies,178
    with the legislation. This is because installations that are not low-impact facilities must comply,178
    with the relevant State and Territory planning legislation. The ACA cannot investigate a claim that,178
    a facility is not a low-impact facility because it has no jurisdiction to investigate breaches of State,178
    and Territory legislation.,178
(4) The Government's framework for the telecommunications sector seeks to achieve a reasonable,178
    balance between individual local and broader regional and national interests. By facilitating com-,178
"    petition, the Government has given Australians greater access to a wider range of high quality, low",178
    cost telecommunications services. Approvals for the installation of most telecommunications facili-,178
"    ties, however, are dealt with at the local level. In particular, State and Territory legislation covers",178
    the installation of mobile phone towers.,178
    In a limited number of circumstances carriers have immunity from State and Territory laws and can,178
    install telecommunications facilities under Commonwealth law. One of the main such instances re-,178
    lates to the installation of low-impact facilities covered by Schedule 3 to the Telecommunications,178
    Act 1997 (the Act). Carriers seeking to install low-impact facilities are required to comply with,178
    rules of conduct set out in the Act and the Telecommunications Code of Practice 1997 (the Code).,178
"    There are strict rules governing what can be installed, where new infrastructure can be installed,",178
    notification requirements and how carriers must behave.,178
                                      QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,178
,178
"    It is impractical for the Government to legislate every detail of the telecommunications industry,",179
    both due to the technical nature of the industry and the cost. Encouraging good industry practice,179
    through self-regulatory mechanisms such as industry codes of practice and technical standards is an,179
    important strategy.,179
"    To this end, the Government has encouraged the telecommunications industry to develop and im-",179

    ments and some improved methods for addressing concerns about electromagnetic energy (EME),179
    emission levels for all radiocommunication facilities installed under Commonwealth and State and,179
    Territory laws. The Industry Code requires carriers to have regard to ‘community sensitive loca-,179
    tions' such as residential areas when locating telecommunication facilities.,179
    The Industry Code has been registered by the ACA under the Act. The Industry Code is therefore,179
    mandatory and the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) can enforce the Industry Code,179
    and take action when carriers are in breach of the requirements under the Industry Code.,179
(5) Local Councils have control under relevant State or local planning legislation for all telecommuni-,179
    cations installations except those covered by Schedule 3 to the Telecommunications Act 1997 (the,179
    Act). Schedule 3 does not exempt the installation of mobile phone towers from State or local plan-,179
    ning legislation.,179
    The Australian Communications Authority (ACA) is responsible for regulating telecommunications,179
"    and radiocommunications, including promoting industry self-regulation. The ACA is also responsi-",179

     record what purpose the licence is used for.,180
     The ACA has further advised that it keeps records of the location of transmitters for Spectrum Li-,180
     cences. The ACA has further advised that it does not record whether the transmitters are for 3G,180
"     purposes, who owns the facility and whether the facility is installed and in operation or whether it",180
     is installed on Commonwealth land. Nor does the ACA maintain a record of all places where chil-,180

     communities supported by RASS was around 230 and as at 1 January 2005 the number of commu-,191

"     2005 – 06 and 2007 – 08 as communities can apply at any time and if they are eligible for RASS, if",191

"     (a) In late January 2004, the Department of Transport and Regional Services (DOTARS) invited",191
     tenders for new contracts for RASS services to eligible communities. Tenders received indicated,191
     that the quantum of RASS funding at that time was not sufficient to service all eligible communi-,191
     ties. The 2004-05 Budget provided additional funding of $7.7m for the scheme over the next four,191
     years. The January tender was terminated and a new tender commenced. This new tender was ad-,191
     vertised on 22 May 2004 and closed on 15 June 2004. Evaluation of the tender bids was detailed,191
