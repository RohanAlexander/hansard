    Senator Ellison-The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honour-,147
able senator's question:,147
(1)   In the Attorney-General's portfolio there are two executive agencies: CrimTrac and the Insolvency,147
      and Trustee Service Australia.,147
(2) CrimTrac,147
      (a) 1 July 2000.,147
"      (b) The CrimTrac agency was established to implement the Federal Government's commitment,",147
"          prior to the 1998 election to provide $50m over 3 years to establishing CrimTrac, a national",147
          crime information system. The election policy stated that ‘CrimTrac will allow police forces,147
          across Australia to speedily access and share information to solve crimes and catch criminals.',147
"          It further promised that CrimTrac would include details on fingerprints, domestic violence and",147
"          apprehended violence orders, firearm licences, stolen vehicle information; and DNA; and a",147
          national child sex offender database.,147
          The CrimTrac initiative and the establishment of the CrimTrac agency has the support of all,147
"          Australian Police Ministers, through the Australasian Police Ministers Council and an Inter-",147
"          Governmental Agreement exists, governing its ongoing activities.",147
          The CrimTrac Agency replaced the National Exchange of Police Information (NEPI) a former,147
"          national common police service on 1 July 2000, and has a significant program to modernise",147
          and revitalise systems formerly provided by NEPI and create new CrimTrac systems for more,147
          effective police information sharing.,147
      (c) The cost to the Commonwealth was negligible as the cost of the transition project to close,147
"          down the previous organisation, NEPI, in Sydney and to establish CrimTrac was approxi-",147
          mately $2m but was funded by the jurisdictions with remaining NEPI funds.,147
Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (ITSA),147
      (a) 1 July 2000.,147
      (b) ITSA was established as an independent executive agency because its activities are essentially,147
          operational and thus not naturally aligned with those of the rest of the Attorney-General's De-,147
"          partment, which has a policy focus. Separation of ITSA from the Department was seen as one",147
          of a series of measures to re-affirm the Department's identity and influence in government as a,147
"          policy Department. Moreover, independence enables ITSA to focus on its particular role of",147
          administering and regulating the personal insolvency system in Australia and giving effect to,147
,147
           the statutory role of the Official Trustee under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 and the Cus-,148
"           toms Act 1901, and other special trustee services to Government agencies.",148
      (c) At 9 February 2001 the cost of establishing ITSA as an independent agency totalled approxi-,148
"           mately $195,000. That amount does not include the cost of acquisition of some information",148
"           technology hardware, software and communications necessary for ITSA to handle its own IT",148
           requirements independently of the Attorney-General's Department. The transfer of IT respon-,148
           sibilities is not expected to be completed until June 2001 and full set-up costs are not yet,148

(4) CrimTrac,148
      Not applicable.,148
Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia,148
      Establishment costs have been funded from within existing resources.,148
(5) CrimTrac,148
CrimTrac was established to enhance Australian law enforcement with intelligence-based policing be-,148

    Senator Hill-The Minister for Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander,149
Affairs has provided the following information in response to the honourable senator's ques-,149
tion:,149
ATSIC provides annual operational funding to a network of 25 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander,149
"Legal Services (ATSILS), who provide legal aid and a range of associated culturally appropriate serv-",149
"ices in 96 service sites, the majority of which cover remote Regional Australia where mainstream Legal",149
Aid Commissions/Community Legal Services generally do not have a presence.,149
"ATSIC provides the funding from its annual global appropriation. In the 99/00 ATSIC Annual Report, at",149
"page 76 under ATSIC's Output 222 Legal and Preventative Services, there is an extensive outline of the",149
performance of the ATSILS and associated initiatives of other organisations funded under this output.,149
"As of 1 July 2000, ATSIC has revised its external Program/Output reporting structure and the future",149
reporting of the legal aid output element will be found in Annual Reports under the new Advancement,149
of Indigenous Rights and Equity Output group.,149
Locations of ATSILS offices and sub offices as well as ATSIC funding to ATSILS from 1998/99 to,149
2000/01 for the provision of legal aid services are at Attachments A1A6. Funding for subsequent years,149
has not as yet been determined as the ATSIC Board is not due to formulate next year's estimates until,149
April 2001 for the Minister's subsequent consideration after the government's budget is handed down in,149
May.,149
The current funding levels will be increased as a result of the recent Treasurer's announcement (Press,149
Release No 22 of 31/3) to provide additional funding to Aboriginal Organisations who are affected by,149
the amendment to the FBT legislation with respect to the capping of salary packages by Public Be-,149
nevolent Institutions. Officials from various agencies are currently formulating the mechanics of calcu-,149
lating and disbursing this additional funding. It is expected however that such extra funding for the last,149
quarter for 2000/01 will not be actually released to organisations until early in the 2001/02 financial,149
year. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services have been informed of these arrange-,149
ments.,149
It is also foreshadowed that current 00/01funding levels (adjusted for FBT impact) to ATSILS are ex-,149
pected to remain the same except for an annual inflator adjustment.,149
"Under the 99/00 Output 222, the total expenditure by ATSIC was $58.787m. Of this the ATSILS re-",149
ceived $37.159m for the provision of legal aid services. In addition to the funding of 25 ATSILS to pro-,149
"vide legal aid, ATSIC also funded:",149
"       - Two Legal Services Secretariats to advocate on broader Law and Justice issues,",149
"       - Two Deaths in Custody Watch Committee,",149
"       - Five Aboriginal Justice Advisory Committees,",149
"       - The establishment of twelve Family Violence Prevention Units, and",149
       - Various Prevention Diversion and Rehabilitation initiatives including the successful Night Pa-,149
           trols in some Aboriginal communities.,149
"In regard to outsourcing, ATSIC's Program funding for a range of service delivery (including legal aid)",149
is generally provided to Indigenous-owned community organisations. Consequently these organisations,149
are in essence third party service providers and therefore ATSIC contends that its service delivery is,149
already outsourced (to third party service providers).,149
As the funder of third party service providers ATSIC continually strives to achieve efficiency and en-,149
"hanced quality of services being delivered to its constituency. In 1996, the ATSIC elected arm of NSW",149
determined that the provision of legal aid services in NSW should be ‘Regionalised' thus providing,149
greater accountability to the Regional Councils by the ATSILS. At the same time ATSIC took into ac-,149
count general government policy in regard to outsourcing and contestability considerations. This re-,149
sulted in a state-wide tender process for the provision of culturally appropriate legal aid services to In-,149
digenous people in NSW.,149
The tender assessment resulted in six Aboriginal organisations being selected to provide legal aid serv-,149
ices. They continue to do so to the present time and are likely to do so in the immediate future. The,149
,149
ability to provide culturally appropriate effective services and cost efficiencies were two primary crite-,150
ria in the assessment of the tenders which included responses from mainstream legal firms.,150
To date the NSW competitive tendering arrangements for the provision of regionalised legal aid serv-,150
ices has not been expanded to other States. However the continued operational financing of all ATSILS,150
is subject to a rigorous annual assessment of submissions from applicants to ensure that the legal aid,150
providers have the corporate governance and administrative capacity and infrastructure to provide qual-,150
ity and culturally appropriate legal aid services to Indigenous people. This process in itself is a form of,150
competitive consideration for the provision of culturally appropriate services.,150
ATSIC's priority at this stage for existing ATSILS has been to implement a range of reforms which in-,150
cludes the adoption by ATSILS of national minimum and Best Practice service standards and associated,150
"quality service initiatives. ATSIC has reported regularly to Cabinet on these reforms, which are consis-",150
tent with and in some cases exceed reforms to the mainstream legal aid sector introduced by this gov-,150
ernment.,150
More details on the progress of reforms being effected to ensure enhanced quality service delivery by,150
"the ATSILS can be found in ATSIC's 99/00 Annual report, pages 76-90. As foreshadowed in the report,",150
ATSIC has undertaken a study of the contestability continuum.,150
"To date only one existing Indigenous legal aid provider has been formally advised that outsourcing, i.e.",150
"a contestable tender process, may be considered in future. This is the Aboriginal Legal Rights Move-",150
ment in South Australia. Natural Justice and Administrative Law principles require that ATSIC give,150
current providers adequate notice of such possible consideration.,150
This consideration in South Australia is a direct result of the South Australian ATSIC elected arm,150
wishing to consider all options for the provision of legal aid services to its constituency.,150
"If a tender process is determined for South Australia the existing provider, ALRM, would be able to",150
submit a tender.,150

February 2001:,156
(1)   Is the Minister aware that a proposed hostel development approved by Hobart City Council on 6,156
      February 2001 threatens nesting and feeding sites of the endangered swift parrot?,156
(2)   What other species or communities are threatened?,156
(3)   What action will the Minister take to protect this important habitat?,156
    Senator Hill-The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:,156
(1)   I am aware of the decision by Hobart City Council to sell land on Mount Nelson for the purpose of,156
      an aged care hostel. I am advised that the land supports a stand of Eucalyptus ovata which is an,156
      important food tree for the endangered swift parrot. These feed trees are within 500 metres of nest,156
      sites for the parrots.,156
"(2)   There are no endangered ecological communities in the area. On the information available to me, I",156
      am not able to advise whether the proposed development is likely to affect any nationally threat-,156
      ened species.,156
(3)   The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 provides that an action that,156
"      has, will have, or is likely to have a significant impact on a nationally threatened species (or an-",156
      other matter of national environmental significance) requires approval from the Federal Environ-,156
      ment Minister.,156
      My Department has written to Hobart City Council advising them of the provisions of the Act.,156
"      However, sale of the land by itself would not require my approval. When and if a firm proposal is",156
"      made to develop the site, the proponent will need to refer the project to me if it is likely to have a",156
      significant impact on the Swift Parrot (or any other matter of national environmental significance).,156

"    Senator Ellison-The Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the",157
following answer to the honourable senator's question:,157
(1)   Employer satisfaction with graduate skills has been an issue for universities for some time. In the,157

      The Government has approached this in two ways.,157
      -   All universities are required to prepare Quality Plans for the annual profiles discussions. These plans are ex-,157
"           pected to include a description of graduate attributes, feedback from employers on the quality of graduates, and",157

    Senator Hill-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the,158
honourable senator's question:,158
The Minister for Defence provided advice on those issues which fall directly under his portfolio respon-,158
sibility:,158
Note - I have 3 changes to - Senator's question - senator's question:,158
(1) (a) Yes. This undertaking was part of the package of nuclear disarmament measures agreed to,158
           by all Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) parties at the 2000 NPT review conference.,158
           In his media release on the review conference the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated “I par-,158
           ticularly welcome the unequivocal commitment of the Nuclear Weapon States to the total,158
           elimination of their nuclear arsenals”.,158
"       (b) The Government places a high priority on further progress towards nuclear disarmament, but",158
           accepts the political reality that reductions in nuclear weapons – leading to a world free of,158
           them – will only be achieved through a series of incremental and reinforcing steps.,158
           The Government is committed to full implementation of the outcomes of the 2000 NPT Re-,158
"           view Conference, including the package of nuclear disarmament measures. At the 2000 UN",158
"           General Assembly, Australia was pleased to support the Algerian NPT resolution, the “New",158
"           Agenda” resolution, and the Japanese nuclear disarmament resolution (which we co-",158
"           sponsored), all of which helped lock in the NPT review conference outcomes.",158
           The Government believes that for the present the primary responsibility for nuclear disar-,158
           mament lies with the two states with the largest nuclear arsenals – the United States and,158
           Russia.,158
           The Government will continue to make clear to the United States and Russia its expectation,158
           of further action towards the elimination of nuclear weapons. The Government also wel-,158
           comes and encourages unilateral nuclear disarmament action taken by the smaller nuclear,158
           weapon states.,158
           An effective non-proliferation regime is essential to further progress towards nuclear disar-,158
           mament. The Government will continue its active support for the vitally important reinforc-,158
           ing steps through which all countries can contribute to an environment favourable for nu-,158
           clear weapons elimination.,158
,158
            Australia is a strong supporter of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and,159
"            will continue to work to secure CTBT entry into force. In late 2000, Australian posts over-",159
            seas made a further round of representations to key countries urging early signa-,159
            ture/ratification of the CTBT. Australia took the lead in tabling the CTBT resolution adopted,159
            by an overwhelming majority at last year's UN General Assembly. Australia is taking an ac-,159
            tive role in arrangements for a high-level conference to be held in New York in September to,159
            promote CTBT entry into force.,159
            The Government will continue to press for an immediate start to negotiation of a Fissile,159
            Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT) to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear weap-,159
            ons. Pending a start to negotiations the Government is working on a number of issues that,159
"            will arise in the context of negotiating an FMCT, including an approach to verification. The",159
            Government will also continue its efforts to achieve universal application of the Additional,159
            Protocol developed to strengthen the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards sys-,159
            tem.,159
      (c) No. It would be premature to speculate on the impact national missile defence (NMD) could,159
            have on progress towards disarmament. The United States is yet to take firm decisions on the,159
"            type of missile defence system it intends pursuing, but has made it clear that it is committed",159
"            to consulting its allies and other key states, notably China and Russia, on its missile defence",159
            plans.,159
      (d) The Government is not prepared to speculate on hypothetical situations.,159
(2)   (a) The Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap has supported and continues to support arms control,159
            and treaty verification initiatives. We expect these critically important functions will remain,159
            regardless of the progress of NMD development. See also response to 1(c).,159
      (b) See response to (2)(a).,159
(3)   There have been many discussions at both the Ministerial and officials level with the US over the,159
      years on Australian participation in ballistic missile early warning. There have been no discus-,159
      sions between the Australian Government and the new US Administration on possible Australian,159
      participation in NMD and TMD programs.,159

      (b) No. The funds referred to are for the procurement of SBIRS research equipment for Defence.,159
      (c) No changes are under consideration.,159
      (d) See response to (5)(c).,159
      (e) The ballistic missile early warning function supported by the Relay Ground Station Pine Gap,159
            is not in violation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Given the undeveloped nature of the,159
"            program, commenting on SBIRS Low is speculative.",159
      (f) (g) and (h) The Government will not speculate on hypothetical situations.,159
"(6)   (a) The Government has discussed these, and other security issues, in regional as well as bilat-",159
"            eral dialogues. The Defence Minister, Mr Reith also discussed NMD during his recent visit",159
            to China.,159
"      (b) and (c) Australia has a strong interest in healthy bilateral relations with China, and with con-",159
            tinuing to manage any differences in a sensible and forthright way. We have urged China to,159
            avoid contributing both to vertical and horizontal missile proliferation and other activities,159
"            which may undermine strategic stability. However, differences over missile defence and",159
            matters relating to force modernisation and the strategic balance are essentially for China to,159

    Senator Ellison-The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honour-,167
able senator's question:,167
(1)   The Attorney General's Department including Australian Protective Service currently has 133,167
      vehicles in its fleet.,167
(2)   Forty Five new vehicles have been leased in the 2000-01 financial year to date and it is expected,167
      that a further 19 will be leased during the remainder of the year. Details of make (vehicle descrip-,167
,167
      tion) size (vehicle category) and kilowatts of the vehicles (horsepower is no longer a commonly,168
      used measurement for vehicle power) are detailed in Attachment A.,168
" (3)  61 new vehicles were leased during the 1999-2000 financial year. Details of make, size and kilo-",168
      watts of the vehicles are detailed in Attachment A.,168
 (4)  Two vehicles in the Attorney-General's Department fleet are fuelled by liquid petroleum gas,168
"      (LPG). The remainder run on either petrol or diesel, with the exception of one, which is a dual fuel",168
      vehicle.,168
 (5)  The Attorney General's Department does not use its own LPG or CNG refuelling stations,168
" (6)  The Department utilises monthly Fleet Profile and usage reports to monitor fuel usage and also,",168
"      through DASFLEET, offers driver training courses to improve driver efficiency and fuel con-",168
      sumption.,168
 (7)  The fuel efficiency ratings for all the vehicles in the Department's fleet are included in Attachment,168
      A. The Australian Greenhouse Office has advised that commercial and four wheel drive vehicles,168
      weighing 2.7 tonnes and higher are not subject to fuel efficiency ratings at this stage.,168
 (8)  The annual energy report produced by DASFLEET is used to compare actual fuel consumption,168
      and kilometres travelled against the fuel efficiency rating for each vehicle. In most instances they,168
"      compare favourably. In instances where this is not the case, action is taken to address the problem",168
      on an individual basis.,168
 (9)  Because of the fluctuations in the price of petrol and LPG it is difficult to determine what opera-,168
"      tional savings, if any, would have been achieved during the 1999-2000 financial year if all the ve-",168
      hicles had been run on LPG. Any savings made would have been offset by higher lease rates,168
      which apply to gas converted vehicles. I understand that CNG is still being developed and is not,168

honourable senator's question:,180
(1)   The Government has welcomed recent positive developments in the Bougainville peace process.,180
      Australia has made a significant contribution to advancing an agreement on the principles of a ref-,180
      erendum to determine the political future of the province by offering some informal guidance to,180
      assist the parties. Most recently the Government facilitated the convening of one of the largest,180
"      gatherings to date to discuss weapons disposal and autonomy, through hosting a meeting between",180
      the parties to the peace process in Townsville in February. Although the Townsville talks did not,180
"      result in an agreement, they were an important step towards an eventual settlement on Bougain-",180
"      ville, and saw a considerable narrowing of the differences between the parties.",180
      Australia appreciates that the issues are complex and that reaching and implementing a settlement,180
      agreement will take time. Australia will accept whatever settlement arrangements the parties ne-,180
      gotiate.,180
      Australia's contribution to the peace process on Bougainville is highlighted by the work of the,180
      Peace Monitoring Group in helping to bring normality to the island.,180

(2) and (3) The Government of Papua New Guinea has been working towards the establishment of an,181

Childcare Rebate was only available as a retrospective payment on presentation of receipts for care,183

(1) (a) Available data on Childcare Rebate customers relates to those families who have claimed the,183

    Senator Alston-The Minister for Arts and the Centenary of Federation has provided the,184
following answer to the honourable senator's question:,184
"(1)   Yes, the relinquishment of the Archives' repository in the Adelaide suburb of Collinswood repre-",184
      sents the first in a program that will see the National Archives move from the majority of its re-,184

      sesses its collection to identify and dispose of records of no continuing historical or administrative,184
      value. The Archives applies modern archival appraisal techniques to make decisions about what,184
"      records need to be kept to satisfy the needs of accountability, the community and government",184
      business.,184
"      Of all government records created, the National Archives presently keeps between five and ten per",184
      cent. Equivalent institutions in countries with which the Archives compares itself - New Zea-,184
"      land, Canada, the UK, the USA and a number of European countries - usually retain between one",184
      and five per cent.,184
      It is expected that administrative material from the 1960s to 1980s transferred to the Archives,184
"      without adequate evaluation will be disposed of, after consultation with the appropriate agency.",184
,184
      The Archives does not set quotas or targets to quantify how much of the collection is no longer,185
      retained.,185
"      Resources saved from the storage, documentation and care of material appraised as having no on-",185

(3)   There will be no job losses in these States in the foreseeable future as a result of relocations of,185
      National Archives of Australia premises.,185
"(4)   The National Archives of Australia's Service Charter, which is available on the Archives' website,",185
      details the standards of service that apply to those seeking access to the Archives collection. For,185
"      those unable to visit an Archives reading room to undertake their own research, the Archives is",185
      committed to answering inquiries about material in the collection within 30 days. If a response,185
      will be delayed beyond 30 days inquirers are advised of the reasons for the delay. All researchers,185
      who contact the Archives by phone or email are informed of the 30-day response time. In 1999-,185
"      2000, 96 per cent of 73 846 inquiries received were answered within 30 days.",185
(5)   All reference inquiries received nationally by the National Archives are currently being forwarded,185
      to Canberra for registration and allocation to the office holding the relevant records. The Archives,185
      is trialing the central registration and allocation of reference inquiries to assess whether this allows,185
"      the Archives to respond to an increasing number of reference inquiries in the most efficient, equi-",185
"      table and consistent manner. Once registered, reference inquiries are sent to the office holding",185
      relevant records for response.,185
      Researchers do not necessarily know which of the eight offices of the Archives hold records rele-,185
"      vant to their research. With all reference inquiries coming to a central address, they can be",185
      matched to the holdings of a particular office and sent to that office for reply ensuring that the re-,185
      searcher receives a complete response to their inquiry rather than being directed to contact another,185
      office.,185
(6)   All reference inquiries received by the National Archives are registered on a computer database on,185
      receipt. The database records which office or offices are responding to each inquiry or a part of it.,185
"      Archives reference staff, wherever located, can access this database and readily determine if other",185

"(7)   The central receipt and processing of reference inquiries aims to provide an efficient, equitable",185
      and consistent level of service to all persons seeking to access the Archives' collection. All in-,185

    Senator Hill-The answer to the honourable senator's questions is as follows:,185
(1) to (4) Bougainville is in a unique situation among the PNG provinces in that it has to share its budg-,185

(4)   The environmental impact in Tasmania will be minimal as the harvest is restricted to salvage op-,199
      erations in cases where the tree ferns would otherwise be destroyed by normal forestry activities.,199
      The impact in destination countries is considered minimal as the tree ferns are primarily exported,199

            Department has followed this up and been advised that investigations have not yet been fi-,208
            nalised.,208
(2)   (a) One of the requirements for approval as a business sponsor is that the business is operating,208
            lawfully in Australia. Sponsors are required to provide a certificate of their business regis-,208
"            tration, company extract or equivalent as evidence of satisfying this requirement.",208
      The registration of companies and their directors falls within the Corporations Act 1989 and Cor-,208
      porations Law. The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) is responsible for,208
"      administering this Act, including monitoring and enforcement. Under section 201B of the Corpo-",208
"      rations Law, persons must not act as a director (or manage a company without Court consent) for",208
"      five years if they have been declared bankrupt or if convicted of offences under company law,",208
      such as insolvent trading or breach of duties as a company director. Directors must also be over,208
      18. Bankruptcy information is maintained by the Insolvency Trustee Service Australia (ITSA) on,208
"      the National Personal Insolvency Index (NPII). As the watchdog of the Corporations Act, ASIC is",208
      responsible for taking action against persons acting as directors where the company is in liquida-,208
      tion or where fraud is suspected.,208
"      Associations (as opposed to companies) are registered with relevant State government authorities,",208
"      rather than ASIC. For associations to be registered, they are required to lodge financial docu-",208
"      ments, such as annual statements and details of office holders. The SVTA is currently registered",208
,208
    with the NSW Department of Fair Trading. Their records show that SVTA has been registered,209
    since 1983.,209
"    In the absence of conflicting advice, officers of my Department accept a current business registra-",209
"    tion certificate, or equivalent, as proof that the sponsor meets registration requirements to lawfully",209
    operate as a business. My Department has contacted the NSW Department of Fair Trading seeking,209
    their advice on the checks they make regarding office holders of associations registered in NSW in,209
"    general, and any adverse information they hold regarding Dr Janarthanan.",209
    (b) Departmental databases were checked as part of the sponsorship approval and revealed no,209
          adverse information on the sponsor. Regulation 1.20D(2)(d) of the Migration Act requires,209
"          that, for a sponsorship to be approved, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Af-",209
          fairs (DIMA) decision-maker must be satisfied that “nothing adverse is known about the,209
          business background of the applicant”. Where there is doubt regarding the ability of the pro-,209
"          spective sponsor to meet this criterion, current policy states that the decision-maker should",209
          make direct checks on the employer's standing with bodies including ASIC (and ASX and,209
          ATO).,209
"(3) On 28 February 2001, officers of my Department interviewed separately the Indian workers and",209
"    members of SVTA. As a result of the information obtained, my Department wrote to the NSW",209
    Department of Industrial Relations seeking their views on whether there had been a breach of in-,209
"    dustrial relations laws, in this case believed to be the Building Tradesmen (State) Construction",209
    Award and the NSW Industrial Relations Act 1996. My Department also wrote to the ATO seeking,209
    their advice on whether taxation laws may have been breached.,209
    My Department has also contacted the Country South District Office of WorkCover NSW over,209
"    this matter. They have been supplied with details of the complaints, and are conducting investiga-",209
    tions into possible breaches of occupational health and safety (OH&S) and workers compensation,209
    laws.,209
"    Although relevant agencies have yet to confirm actual breaches occurred, given admissions by the",209
"    sponsor, my Department wrote to the sponsor on 8 March 2001 advising them that it appeared",209
    they had breached their sponsorship undertakings in relation to the 8 workers. They were re-,209
    quested to provide a response within 35 days as to why their sponsorship status should not be re-,209
    voked under s137B of the Migration Act 1958. No reply was received within the 35-day limit. My,209
    Department is now considering options for resolving this case.,209
"(4) (a) Although over 30,000 overseas workers come to Australia each year on long-stay temporary",209
"          business visas (subclass 457), only 12 cases of alleged exploitation have come to the De-",209
"          partment's attention in 2000/01, either as a result of regular monitoring activity, or reports",209
"          from unions and others in the community. For January and February 2001, DIMA Business",209
          Centres undertook 39 site visits and cancelled 97 visas. DIMA is currently compiling moni-,209
          toring data for March 2001.,209
    (b) All employers who sponsor overseas workers sign an undertaking that they agree to meet,209
"          certain responsibilities in relation to overseas employees they sponsor, including financial",209
          responsibility for obligations to the Commonwealth (such as payment of tax and superannu-,209
"          ation), compliance with Australian industrial relations laws and conditions of employment,",209
          and responsibility for medical and hospital costs.,209
"    My Department processes around 10,000 business sponsorships a year. Enforcement of laws and",209
    other statutory requirements including those relating to employment is similarly the responsibility,209
"    of the relevant government agency. Where possible breaches of industrial relations laws, OH&S",209
"    requirements and other legislative breaches are identified, these are referred to the relevant",209
"    agency. To assist in this, my Department undertakes targeted monitoring of employers, including",209
"    site visits, to provide additional assurance that employers are honouring their sponsorship under-",209
    takings. My Department also works closely with the community and unions to ensure overseas,209
"    workers are only employed when they have an appropriate work right, and that employment is in",209
    accordance with Australian awards and conditions.,209
"(5) In July 2000, I announced a review would be conducted into the Temporary Residence Program",209
    (including the 457 visa category) to examine ways to further streamline entry and enhance integ-,209
    rity of this program. Public submissions to the Review were invited through advertisements in the,209
"    national press, and a discussion paper was forwarded to a range of stakeholders, including em-",209
,209
"      ployers and major users of these visas, employer organisations, unions, relevant Government de-",210
"      partments and other interested groups. Almost 100 submissions were received, including from",210
"      unions such as the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU).",210
      The review will be finalised soon and I will be making announcements on the outcome of this re-,210
      view in due course.,210
(6)   The state of the labour market is taken into account in the 457 visa category. Procedures under this,210
      category are designed to strike a balance between the needs of business in Australia to quickly,210
"      bring in overseas personnel with skills and experience that are not readily available locally, while",210
      safeguarding job opportunities for Australian citizens and permanent residents.,210
      Labour market testing is required under the 457 category unless the position to be filled is consid-,210
"      ered “key”, is on the Migration Occupations in Demand List (MODL), or is for less than 12",210
"      months. “Key” activities are those that are essential to the business operations of the employer,",210
"      and include specialist skills. The Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small",210
      Business (DEWRSB) develops the MODL to identify and target skilled occupations that have a,210
      continuing Australia wide labour shortage. The MODL takes a longer term view of the Australian,210
"      labour market, rather than reacting to short term fluctuations.",210
"      In addition to labour market testing requirements, to be approved as a business sponsor of over-",210
"      seas temporary workers, the business must demonstrate that:",210
      -    they are lawfully operating in Australia;,210

            nology; and,210
      -    they have a satisfactory record of compliance with immigration laws.,210
      These arrangements have worked well. Over 85 per cent of visa category 457 entrants are granted,210
      to people to fill professional and managerial positions. The expanding ICT industry alone accounts,210
      for a quarter of these visas.,210

       Senator Minchin-The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer,220
  to the honourable senator's question:,220
  (1)     A registered entity providing a taxable supply must charge GST to its customers. This amount less,220
          any input tax credits must then forwarded to the Australian Taxation Office.,220
          The liability for collecting GST rests with each registered business entity along the supply chain.,220
          Registered suppliers do not bear the cost of the GST because it is passed on in the price of their,220
          goods and services.,220
"  (2)     Government entities are no longer able to claim an exemption from tax, as they could previously",220

(1)   It is the ACCC's firm policy not to disclose the names of complainants as to do so would preju-,221
      dice the operations of the ACCC as an effective law enforcement agency. The majority of the,221
      ACCC's investigations of potential contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 are initiated as,221
      a result of persons contacting the ACCC and providing information about potentially unlawful,221
"      conduct. If the ACCC was to disclose the names of complainants, it is likely that in future persons",221
      would be significantly less inclined to contact the ACCC and provide details of potentially unlaw-,221
      ful conduct for fear of publicity or possible retribution.,221
(2)   No.,221

"             to Mr Hassett's formal interview, the ACCC specifically interviewed 21 commercial inter-",221
             ests or business people in this matter and made inquiries with a number of other parties.,221
      (b) For a complaint to be a matter that is likely to lead to ACCC involvement in seeking a reso-,221
"             lution, enquiries need first to be made by the ACCC to determine if the alleged conduct was",221
             an isolated instance or if it was part of a wider pattern. The ACCC's enquiries quickly un-,221
             covered further alleged contraventions of the Trade Practices Act by Commercial and Gen-,221
"             eral Publications, and based on this the ACCC determined that the allegation warranted full",221

             was a sufficient evidentiary basis before contacting him and alleging contraventions of the,221
             Trade Practices Act.,221
(5)   The ACCC is very concerned about the practice of ‘telephone blowing' and has taken action under,221
      the Trade Practices Act against a number of persons and businesses engaging in this form of con-,221
"      duct, which usually involves asserting a right to payment for placement of an advertisement in a",221

(1) How many places under this program are currently allocated to the Northern Territory.,221
,221
(2)   How many places are allocated to each town or community in the Northern Territory.,222
(3)   What is the annual CDEP funding to each town or community in the Northern Territory.,222
    Senator Hill-The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) has pro-,222
vided the following information in response to the honourable senator's question:,222
"(1)   As at 1 April 2001, 8,262 (or about 24%) of the 34,175 Community Development Employment",222
      Projects (CDEP) scheme participant places available nationally are allocated to the Northern Ter-,222
      ritory.,222
(2)   ATSIC Regional Councils allocate CDEP places to CDEP Organisations. Some CDEP Organisa-,222
      tions in the Northern Territory provide CDEP services to a single town or community whilst others,222
      are set up to provide services to several towns or communities. In some cases several CDEPs will,222
      service a single town or community.,222
"      As a consequence, I am unable to provide you with the number of places allocated to each town or",222
"      community in the Northern Territory. However, I am able to provide you the attached table which",222
      illustrates the number of places currently allocated to CDEP community organisations operating in,222
      the Northern Territory.,222
"(3)   For reasons outlined in my answer to your 2nd question, I am unable to provide you with annual",222
      CDEP funding to towns and communities of the Northern Territory. In the attached table you will,222
      find the 2000-01 current funding allocations for each CDEP organisation operating in the Northern,222
"      Territory. CDEP funding consists of two components, CDEP Wages and Oncost funding. The final",222
      amount of funding for CDEP wages will depend on the daily number of participants each CDEP,222
      had on their project throughout 2000-01. The amount shown for CDEP Oncost funding represents,222

following answer to the honourable senator's question:,224
(1)   The Commonwealth makes a significant contribution to support the work of schools in improving,224
      the learning outcomes of all young Australians and will provide approximately $311 million in,224
      2001 under the Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes Programme. In 2001 the,224
      Northern Territory share of this funding is expected to be approximately $5.38 million.,224
      The Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes Programme was introduced in 2001,224
      and combines funding formerly provided under the Commonwealth's literacy and numeracy and,224
      special education school support fixed and per capita programmes. The objective of the pro-,224
"      gramme is to improve the learning outcomes of educationally disadvantaged students, particularly",224
"      in literacy and numeracy, and the educational participation and outcomes of students with dis-",224
"      abilities, including students with an intellectual disability.",224
      State and Territory government and non-government education authorities are responsible for the,224
      detailed administration of this funding. They have the flexibility to decide which students and,224
      schools have the greatest need for support and to direct funds accordingly.,224
,224
      In addition to funding provided under the Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes,225
"      Programme, the Commonwealth will provide $82,000 to the Northern Territory under the Special",225
      Education – Non-government Centre Support Programme. The objective of this programme is to,225
"      improve the educational opportunities, learning outcomes and personal development of children",225
      with disabilities who need services provided at or in connection with non-government centres.,225
(2)   No. The Commonwealth funding is supplementary. State and Territory Governments have primary,225
      responsibility for school education and it is expected that they would be providing funding to sup-,225
      port the education of students with a disability.,225

      this answer.,225
      The Northern Territory Department of Education is the sole agent for administering funding pro-,225

      $0.44 million for the Association of Independent Schools of the Northern Territory.,225
(4)   The financial and educational accountability and reporting requirements for education authorities,225
      administering Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes Programme are as for Com-,225
      monwealth Programmes for Schools more generally.,225
      Funding agreements between the Commonwealth and education authorities specify that funds,225
      must be spent in accordance with programme guidelines and contain accountability and reporting,225
      requirements.,225
      Financial accountability requirements are for a Financial Accountability certificate signed by an,225
      authorised person to be provided by 30 June of the year following the programme year for which,225
      the funds were provided.,225
      Educational accountability is largely met through participation in the preparation of a national re-,225
      port on the outcomes of schooling (the Annual National Report on Schooling in Australia or,225
"      ANR), including the provision information for inclusion in the ANR addressing the performance",225
