"before Friday, but the Government has          away. Senator Murphy can complain as",33
"suddenly realised that there is still a part   much as he likes, notwithstanding the",33

"whatever it can of the rule of law and it      not take away existing rights, and that is",33

in the name of crunching the unions. It        anybody to give me any definition of 're-,33

But the Government is teaching some very       Senator Murphy talks about there being a,33

      Some specific points have been made to            Commissioner. It is not a question of a,59

"lar provision-no t exactly identical-t o              difficult. It is an unreasonable, slanted,",59
that in the present legislation. In the pre-         unfortunate attitude which gives expression,59
sent legislation a senior commissioner has            to that sort of view. Obviously any reason-,59
the obligation under section 27 to allocate           able person would regard these provisions,59
the work of the commissioners and concil-            as a genuine effort to promote the pro-,59

   Senator GREENWOOD- I suggest that              That is the broad pattern which existed,71
what I have to say is by way of justifica-    in the 1970 amendments. The Opposition,71

engaging in limitations of work. The Gov-     ceeding or adjourned sine die with liberty,71
ernment believes that it must be firm but      to re-apply. The existing provisions have,71
restrained in the approach which it adopts     not resulted in the dreadful consequences,71
to these matters. It is firmly wedded to the   which we all remember were prophesied all,71
"principles of sanctions, but it recognises     night at a certain period when we debated",71
that every reasonable opportunity should       them; nor will the provisions which are,71
be given for the processes of conciliation     now being proposed have any of the dire,71

   When an application for a bans clause,71

to have the matter resolved with good will     regarded as criticism that the presidential,71
and in the interests of everybody con-        member has been given the powers.,71
,71
"    One change which is involved is that,       ( Mr MCMahon) has said, and as I am",72
"whilst the presidential member is to be         authorised to say, if fines are imposed they",72
 given discretion as to bow he goes about       will be collected. We heard from Senator,72
dealing with applications under proposed        James MCClelland some comment about,72
