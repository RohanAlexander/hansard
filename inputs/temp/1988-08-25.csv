"gration administration is about distinguishing         relationships, and the quality of life of people",166
as between one individual applicant and an-           already in this country. He would have us,166

"more than distinguishing between individual            son it was put on in the first place, was to",166
applicants. Immigration policy is about                make a clear statement to the international,166
"drawing distinctions between categories of             community from this Parliament, from both",166
