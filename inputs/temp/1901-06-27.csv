- I should like to say a few words upon this        Senator Sir JOHNDOWNER (South,39
clause 54. The whole position appears to        Australia) - I have listened to a great part,39
me to lie within a very small compass.          of this debate and thought very seriously,39
"The question is whether what we are under-     over the question, which I knew would",39
"taking to'do is a constitutional act or the     inevitably be debated at length, and which",39
reverse.     As I read the Constitution we      immediately and prejudicially concerns one,39
have no power to legistate directly on such     of the States of the union. We have had,39
"a subject as gambling. That being so, I do      some remarkably able and eloquent speeches",39
"not see how by indirect means we can            from two honorable senators opposite,",39
under the broadest interpretation of the        Senator Clemons and Senator Harney. I,39
"Constitution, and with a desire to do what      am sure we all feel very proud to have",39
"is right, try to effect indirectly that which   gentlemen amongst us who can argue",39
we cannot constitutionally effect directly.     a matter of tliis kind with so much,39
That is the crux of the whole question. I f     fairness aad eloquence.              I have felt,39
"the Government can show us, or show to me,      impressed with what the honorable senator",39
