govern all public exercises of the right to free        anything other than the creative imagination of,36

of our minds the emotion that is inevitably             apply these principles in practice should anyone,36

perience in trying to apply it. I think the most         that has created much of the confusion and com-,36
grap-ic way of expressing the maze-like com-           plexity that is evident in the language of this Ordi-,36
pleXity of this Ordinance is to look at the diagrams    nance. There are difficulties about it conceptually,36
"or charts prepared by Mr Robin Handley for the          in principle, that we spoke of yesterday.",36
,36
   There are obvious practical difficulties about      everyone knows where he stands. What that single,37

this kind.                                             What we need is a law which covers those prob-,37
"    It has been said by Senator Lewis today that the   lems and deals with them, not a law which tries to",37
kinds of discussions that have taken place in re-     deal with those problems in the extraordinarily,37

"various contending groups, mini-groups and",37
potential groups were in fact a triumph for the            That brings me to the last of the categories of,37
procedures contained in this Ordinance. They           objection I have-objections to the breach of the,37
were in fact an indication of just how much sense      peace provisions. In these breach of the peace,37
"the compulsory conference notion had about it.         provisions contained in clause 24, we have the nub",37
"But I remind Senator Lewis, who has come into          of what could be a sensible statement of the law of",37
the chamber and is nodding his head sagely at the      public assembly insofar as it bears upon the kind,37
"summary I have just given of what he had to say         of behaviour which should be outlawed and, in",37
"earlier, that the consultations which took place        particular, insofar as it bears upon the situation of",37
"this week and, more particularly yesterday, were        provocation on the one hand matched by response",37
 not those provided for by the statutory terms of       on the other. The trouble with clause 24 as it is,37
 this Ordinance. They are entirely voluntary out-      drafted at the moment is that it is much too crude,37
 side the framework of this Ordinance because           and blunt an instrument. As it is drafted it has ab-,37

 Commissioner's decision is basically made as to        free speech.,37
 who gets in and who stays out. One can equally,37
" well, of course, have these sorts of consultations        One cannot have a law drafted as this one is",37
 that have taken place without any of the lunatic       which operates simply to allow the police to move,37

"    What we need is not this peculiar, inventive        priority to the interests, however irrational, well-",37
 notion of a limited participation assembly. Nor do     founded or well-justified in principle those,37

" wearing a hat as a participant, as a spectator or as   having anything to say in this area and the law",37
 part of the mainstream contingent who were first       allowing a power of arrest is if the law is much,37
 in the field; they could be wearing the hats of        more carefuly drafted than this one is. As I said,37
 those who follow along behind.                         yesterday-I just want to spend a moment saying,37
"    Whatever their status, capacity or role in the      a little more carefully what I mean-that law",37
" assembly, there should be a single law laying out      needs more criteria in it than clause 24 has at the",37
 the ground rules of appropriate behaviour so that      moment.,37
,37
"   Clause 24, at the moment, is in two parts. First,              Senator EVANS-Yes, but do not let us con-",38
it says that anyone who acts with an intention to              fuse matters. The second situation is where a,38

"provision which says, in effect, that anyone who,              of this banner, can see what is likely to happen by",38

   One just has to go beyond that and add some                 unreasonable?,38
additional criteria. The criteria that I and the Op-             Senator EVANS-I think that is totally un-,38
position have suggested are simply the following:              reasonable because it gives no weight,38
"firstly, likelihood of the behaviour causing a                 whatsoever-can Senator Lewis not get into his",38
"breach of the peace; secondly, actually causing a              thick-muscled bucolic head-to the interests of",38
breach of the peace-cannot be just a figment of                free speech and to the right· to assembly of those,38
"some police officer's creative imagination; and,               whose behaviour is not necessarily, intrinsically or",38
"thirdly, the behaviour being of such an objective              objectively offensive but just happens to offend",38
character that it would cause a hostile reaction               someone who is peculiarly prone to so being,38
 not just from the particular person who was                   offended.,38

 that the people causing the high costs are not          not caused a problem are being asked to solve it in,51
