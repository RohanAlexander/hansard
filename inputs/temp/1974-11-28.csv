 times to be less than savoury. So I do not believe   having come through this experience recently,60
 that we should shift the emphasis from the           myself. It did not hurt me personally to resign,60
 individual to the organised party in the recogni-   from a State Parliament and stand for a Federal,60
  tion of the electoral machinery. I think that is a  position. At no time were we as a party fearful of,60
  very big mistake and it is one ofthe major draw-   not winning that position. But it does seem to me,60
  backs of this Bill.                                 to be an injustice that a person involved in a,60

" which I approve and for which reason I will sup-    least safely, whatever experience he or she has to",60
  port the second reading of the Bill. I support the  the Federal Parliament on behalf of a State. I can,60

  hospitals. I support also the control of misuse of   Parliaments in a different way from members of,60
,60
the Public Service or members in any private ac-                   I would also reject any thought of altering the,61
tivity. To me it is an inhibition which is distinctly           full preferential system for the lower House vot-,61
harmful to a State because it prevents State ex-               ing. Whilst it is necessary to do something about,61

"tainly inhibits it. In a practical sense, it prevents           towards the system of first past the post voting",61
it. I would certainly vote against a clause which               which the Labor Party will introduce in,61
"attempted to extend that provision to the Terri-               Australia, as soon as it controls both this House",61

this debate I will certainly move an amendment                      Whilst this may be a big Party Bill-i t seems,61
to try to delete that whole clause. I think we                  that the Opposition regards it as such or sees the,61

     I believe that the deposits required of candi-            the Government on individual issues. No doubt,61
dates are too high. Compared to the deposit paid                 there would be some variation in emphasis but I,61
"in the United States and other countries, I think               can see no variation in general consensus as",61
we are going too high. This tends to fall in with               expressed by anyone on this side of the House on,61

 Senator Missen. The Australia Party probably do                  and speak about optional preferences. If we want,61

have compulsory voting? We have it to try to           and the infringement of the electoral legislation,62
make sure that everybody in Australia records          at various elections. But I do not think that mem-,62
their opinion by voting for a Party which they         bers of this Government and their supporters,62
want to lead this country and which they think         have been altogether lily-white in the practices,62
will be of benefit to the people. If we want com-     they have indulged in during various elections. I,62

preferences? It is rather interesting that this legisto secure votes. In my area of Mackay if it came,62

that if the Government felt that it was going to       fastest racehorse in the malpractices stakes we in,62
get the best deal on compulsory preferences we         the Liberal Party would not be in the race. That,62
would not have this legislation before us now.         puts it very simply and might make honourable,62
    I make no bones about saying that the Labor        senators realise who is the champion in this,62

,110
telegram. That is Senator Cavanagh's prop-                  sought to be given that there has been some form,111

"Premier of a State, or the secretary ofhis depart-          how could he have been getting around quite as",111

"and the law, I will make proper inquiries about              absurd even to suggest that these people are not",111
that. Senator Cavanagh has just explained to me              entitled to send telegrams if they wish to do so.,111
that he has 20 telegrams. He thinks that the                 Are people to be deprived of the right to make,111
