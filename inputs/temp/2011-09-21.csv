against an inquiry into the rape of an            became about climate change and now it is,33

that moment. At that moment they just             this tax is not going to change the,33
became like everybody else. So now we see         temperature one iota. What I will give the,33
the continuation of this duplicitous type of      Greens credit for is that they are about to,33
arrangement of the feigned and faux nobility      bring about a new creed that it is immoral to,33
that they try to exude and then the reality of    be provident and now we have this new,33

"   Interestingly, earlier this year, on 18       nuclear accident of this kind will lead to",118
"April, the Secretary-General of the United       contamination and will have massive health",118
"Nations called for a global rethink of nuclear   and also food security impacts, as we have",118
energy and safety. After the Fukushima           seen with the level of contamination of food,118
"disaster, people around the world began to       in the immediate area of Fukushima. In",118
really think about the implications of a major   relation to the achievement of the Millen-,118
"nuclear disaster. I note that, in recent days,   nium Development Goals, Senator Abetz",118
the former Japanese Prime Minister came out      quotes that the IAEA suggests that the,118

with in the first days after the disaster and    Development Goals. We totally agree.,118

"needed to know in thinking about and             are talking here about costs and risks, and in",118
making those kinds of plans. But think about     fact it is distributed energy produced by,118
it for a moment: imagine a situation in a        renewable energy that has a much greater,118
"developed country, such as Japan, where          opportunity and chance to be able to relieve",118
somebody has to think about moving 30            poverty. I put it this way: in the UNDP,118

"he said, it would mean that Japan would          will require the cost per megawatt hour of",118
cease to exist and operate as a nation-state     electricity to be less than three per cent of,118
during a period where you are trying to          per capita income. Since the majority of,118
manage that kind of disaster. It is worth        those in need of energy live in countries,118
actually considering that.                       where annual per capita incomes are under,118

"$1,000, the need is for technological options  not cool them, there was no water to be able",119
"in the range of $30-$50 per megawatt hour.     to do it, and also they could not dispose of",119
With nuclear you are not going to get it       the hot water into river systems which were,119
"anywhere under $100, if not more as we go      already depleted. At about the same time we",119
into the greater risk parameters that you are  had exactly the same situation in Europe. For,119
"going to have to pay for if you are going to   example, in the summer of 2003 during those",119
try and develop nuclear energy. So what we     record-breaking heatwaves millions of,119
should be doing is opposing the idea that you  people across France and Italy suffered,119
"would try and drive nuclear energy, central-  through extended power shortages after the",119
ised systems requiring governments to          French network of 19 nuclear power plants,119
"underwrite them in terms of cost, posing       had to reduce their operations. Seventy per",119
"difficulties for local communities. Instead,   cent of France's electricity comes from",119
you would support Australian technology in     nuclear power. Italy also purchases about a,119

and exciting area of solar. It is now          providers. During the heatwave those,119

"   On climate change, there is this ridiculous Europe most rapidly embracing renewable",119
"assertion that nuclear energy is required to   energy technology, because they recognise",119
address climate change. It is actually the     that in extreme weather events nuclear is no,119
"opposite. In this report it states that the    good, the reactor has to be shut down.",119
assumptions that need to be reviewed are          So let us get this very straight: rather than,119
"regarding the types of accidents that are      being a solution to climate change, nuclear is",119
possible. The report says that an assessment   actually significantly undermined by climate,119
of those accidents was way too modest and      change. The coalition does not want to,119
"that they need to look at the possible effects address climate change, but we are going to",119
of climate change in relation to nuclear       have more extreme weather events in,119
"energy. That is because nuclear cannot take    Australia, more high-temperature days. It is",119
the heat. We have seen right around the        completely unsuitable technology in this,119
world in the last decade several occasions     country. But I do want on the record that,119
where nuclear reactors have had to be closed   Senator Abetz reiterated that it is coalition,119
"down because of extreme heat conditions,       policy to build nuclear reactors in Australia.",119
which will be increasing as the rate of        He still has not said where he would build,119
climate change accelerates.                    them-,119
   Let me give you a few examples. In July        Senator Bernardi: That's not true.,119
2010 in Alabama we saw the shutdown of            Senator MILNE: Senator Abetz said,119
nuclear facilities to the point where it cost  that. Just a few minutes ago he said that as,119
that energy agency or energy department $50    far as he was concerned the Labor Party is,119
"million, all of which had to be paid for by    not wanting to support nuclear reactors,",119
"customers in Tennessee, when they had to       clearly the Greens do not, and he was hoping",119
close down the reactors because they could,119
,119
that that would be rethought. It is coalition     standing in front of the geothermal tech-,120
"policy and Senator Abetz has made it clear.       nology company in South Australia, where",120
"In the face of climate change, getting nuclear    one exploded recently. Let us call this for",120
"reactors is so ridiculous, and in face of the     what it is. It is another scaremongering tactic",120
disaster that has been Fukushima it is strange    by an extreme green movement that is,120
that anybody could be talking about               seeking to exploit a tragic circumstance and,120
promoting nuclear energy. There we had            a very dangerous circumstance-I will,120
Ziggy Switkowski doing just that. He did not      acknowledge that-for their own base ends.,120
"go and stand outside Fukushima, though, did       There is no doubt that what happened in",120
"he, when he was busy talking about the low        Japan was bad. It was a disaster for the",120
level of risk. He should have gone straight       Japanese people but we have to look at the,120
"there if it were so low-level risk. But no, it is fact that this reactor was built on old",120
the Japanese people who are suffering             technology-40-year-old technology. Clear-,120
because of this.                                  ly it was built in the wrong place and without,120
   I hope that at this meeting in the United      due consideration of the earthquake risk and,120
Nations tomorrow they will not only               the tsunami risk that it was placed under. All,120
consider this but look at the IAEA and say        of these things can be overcome if you can,120
that this organisation needs to split its         overcome an irrational fear of nuclear,120
"responsibilities for looking at nuclear proli-   energy. But, of course, the Greens specialise",120
feration and for its promotion of nuclear as a    in irrational fear to pursue equally irrational,120
"technology. They need to split the regulatory     policy agendas. Senator Ludlam, as I said,",120
"authority from the promotion, and that is one     has not quite succumbed to that as yet.",120
of the very positive things that should come         But the Greens clearly want a baseload,120
out of this meeting tomorrow.                     power system built on the most unreliable of,120
"   Senator BERNARDI (South Australia)             technologies, which is renewable energy",120

Ludlam has had a longstanding and serious         for Australia's base power needs. And it is,120
"interest in, and opposition to, nuclear energy.   startling to hear Senator Milne defend the",120
He has not yet succumbed to the hysteria and      provision of electricity to people all over the,120
hyperbole that we just heard from Senator         world when the Greens and Senator Milne,120
Milne. Senator Milne was on about how             herself want to basically shut down our,120
"nuclear was unreliable, and I can only            baseload power generation capacity in",120
presume that her endorsement of renewable         Australia. Make no mistake: this is part of,120
energy has conveniently overlooked the fact       the Greens policy agenda. They do not want,120
that the recent high winds in the UK forced       to see any new coalmines. They do not want,120
them to close down the wind farms there           to see any more coal fired power stations.,120
because they were at risk of collapse and         But this is only part of their extreme policy,120
catching on fire and actually overpowering        agenda.,120
the electricity grid. I also note that Senator       Might I remind this Senate that Senator,120
"Milne criticised Dr Switkowski for not            Bob Brown, the Leader of the Greens,",120
standing in front of the Fukushima nuclear        actually wanted and has previously called for,120

"also note that Senator Milne has not been         rapidly removed from the Greens website,",120
,120
but I still have the press release. Senator Bob  consistent with the global desire to reduce,121

reality.                                         all over the world conveniently overlooked,121
   We know that the hypocrisy of the Greens      the fact that the nuclear industry in,121
has been demonstrated over and over again. I     somewhere like France supplies a lot of,121
remember when Senator Bob Brown was              western Europe with their electricity needs.,121
"quoted as saying: 'People do not make large      Indeed, you would not have the opportunity",121

in mind favour in return.' I wonder what you     without France's provisions.,121
get when you take the largest corporate             We need to be aware of what the real,121
political donation in the history of this        agenda is here. It is not about the national,121

"ions-it is just a coincidence, we know-that      about provisioning, protecting, defending or",121
when Senator Bob Brown rose and asked a          preparing ourselves for the requirements of,121

combat capability through the use of Reserves and deployable contractors; and (b) have any one-off,156
"savings been made; if so, where are these savings to be found.",156
   Senator Chris Evans: The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the,156
honourable senator's question:,156
"   (a) In general terms, when considering the contribution of Reserves or contractors to â€•combat",156
capabilityâ€– Defence will seek to maximise the strengths and capabilities of each particular element in,156
"order to meet the demands of operational force generation, sustainment and rotation requirements.",156
Reserves and contractors will be utilised where most appropriate to ensure our combat capability meets,156
"national security requirements. Therefore, the immediate cost of combat capability is not necessarily",156
reduced through the use of Reserves or Contractors.,156
   (b) There have been no 'one off' savings in relation to the use of reserves on operations for the period,156
1 January to 30 June 2011. In general terms a Reservist will cost more than a full-time soldier for the,156
