                                              I shall bring the honorable senator's,42
 introduction.    The old system of de-      remarks under the notice of the Minister,42
 livering letters should not be abolished,42

f o r Defence.       Regarding the .remarks,43
of Senators Gardiner and Hoare-al -,43
though the Acting Postmaster-General,43
has already replied- I should like to,43
point out that I am one of the so-,43
called victims of this regulation. But I,43
 frankly confess that I am not suffering,43
 as a result.        Senator Hoare has been,43
" wrongly informed, as the regulation does",43
 not provide that the box must be fixed,43
" to the gate. I f i t does, I am offending,",43
 as my box is fixed to the front fence.,43
 Under the old system a letter carrier,43
" knocked at the door or rang the bell, and",43
 waited until the resident answered. Under,43
" the new system, he puts the letters in tha",43
" box and blows a whistle, and the person",43
 concerned walks f r o m his door to the,43
 fence to get his mail. Contrast those,43
 conditions with those of Central Aus-,43
tralia.     I have i n mind a deputation,43
that waited upon me at Newcastle,43
"""Waters, where .a man helping to develop",43
 that country informed mc that he received,43
" his mail once in six months, and had to",43
 ride 30 miles each way to obtain i t . He,43
 only asked that he should get a delivery,43
 once in three months. I f there were any,43
 money to spare I should give that man a,43
 mail service once in three months rather,43
 than spend i t in saving city peoplo the,43
 trouble of walking f r o m their f r o n t door,43
 to the f r o n t fence.,43
     Senator DUNCAN  - A letter carrier,43
 told me that this regulation should have,43
  been enforced years ago.,43
     Senator PEARCE -Senato r Gardiner,43
 contrasted the position of a man with a,43
  box on his f r o n t fence with that of a,43
 business firm on the eighth floor of a,43
 building. I n those huge buildings there,43
  would probably be five or six firms on one,43
"  floor, and i f the letter carrier did not",43
  deliver to each floor i t would necessitate,43
  a row of boxes on the ground floor ex-,43
" tending, perhaps', along the whole front-",43
 age of the street. The probability is that a,43
 letter carrier would deposit more letters,43
  on one floor of a huge building than he,43
  would deliver in e. street in a residential,43
 suburb. We should have some sense of,43
 proportion.        I really believe that the,43
 hardship is very much exaggerated. Tha,43
 Acting      Postmaster-General       (Senator,43
 Crawford) has made a note of the com-,43
" plaints, however, and w i l l give them, con-",43
 sideration.,43
     Question resolved i n the affirmative.,43
