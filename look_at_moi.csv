TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL 1990
"Bill presented by Mr Duffy, and read a first time."

Second Reading Mr DUFFY (Holt-Attorney-General) (9.01)-1 move:
That the Bill be now read a second time.
"The purpose of this Bill is to amend section 50, the mergers and acquisitions provision, of the Trade Practices Act to overcome an omission which has become apparent in the coverage of the provision, and to make several other improvements."
"Section 50 prohibits acquisitions of shares or assets which result in a corpo- ration either obtaining, or substantially strengthening, a position of dominance in a substantial market in Australia. In de- termining whether a position of domi- nance or strengthened dominance would result, the section permits the aggregation of market shares of companies that are related to or associated with the acquiring corporation. The section defines an asso- ciated body corporate in terms of one body corporate being in a position to exert a substantial degree of influence over another."
"I have in recent months discussed with the Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, Professor Baxt, his concerns that an aspect of the judgment in Trade Practices Commission v Australian Iron and Steel and Ors-the New Zealand Steel case-disclosed a deficiency in the merger provision. The case itself was settled, but in the course of a judgment on some as- pects of the case, the court expressed its views on the meaning of the words 'di- rectly or indirectly' in subsection 50 (1). This.subsection prohibits a corporation from directly or indirectly acquiring shares or assets in a body corporate if a position of dominance would result."
"The Court interpreted the word 'indi- rectly' as applying only to a situation where an acquisition was made by an- other entity as agent for the corporation. In other words it would not be an indirect acquisition by the corporation where a subsidiary or associated company ac- quired assets or shares in a target com- pany in circumstances where it could not be said it was acting as agent for its con- trolling company. Accepting this interpre- tation, the question then is what action,"

"4894 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990 Australian Embassy, Indonesia"

"if any, could be taken under section 50 to prevent an acquisition which might be structured through a subsidiary or an as- sociated company. Where the subsidiary or associated acquiring company is itself a trading, financial or foreign corporation, action can be taken directly against it, with the market positions of all associated and related companies, including the holding or controlling company, taken into account in determining dominance. How- ever where the acquisition is by a body corporate that is not a corporation action cannot be taken against it using the aggre- gation provisions. The insertion of the new section 50 (1AA) will plug this gap."
The Government is taking the oppor- tunity to put forward some other amend- ments to the section to improve its internal consistency. An infringement takes place where as a result of an acqui- sition the relevant acquirer would be or would be likely to be in a position of dominance or strengthened dominance. However the concept of likely effect is not consistently applied in the section and the amendments will remedy this. Also the section is not consistent in its reference to associated companies and again the Bill addresses this.
"The Government believes these amend- ments are desirable to ensure that Austra- lian competition law as embodied in the Trade Practices Act continues to be effec- tive, and that any window of opportunity available to exploit any weakness in the Act is firmly closed. The Bill is expressed to come into operation from today. I con- sider it appropriate that some retrospec- tive effect be given to the measure, to ensure that advantage is not taken of the gap before the Bill becomes law."
"I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill, and commend the Bill to the House."
Debate (on motion by Mr Jull) ad- journed.

"CONSTRUCTION OF AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY COMPLEX IN JAKARTA,"
INDONESIA Reference to Public Works Committee Mr BEDDALL (Rankin-Minister for Small Business and Customs) (9.05)-1 move:
"That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, for consid- eration and report: Construction of an Australian Embassy complex in Jakarta, Indonesia."
The proposal to be referred to the Com- mittee is for the construction of a per- manent chancery to replace the present inadequate chancery and recreation facil- ities. The construction will be on the recently acquired site at Jalan Rasuna Said in the Jakarta central business district. The site is in a prestige area close to a number of other diplomatic missions and Indonesian Government departments.
The present five-storey chancery build- ing at Jalan Thamrin was opened on Aus- tralia Day 1967. The services in the building are reaching the end of their economic life. A large shopping and hotel complex has recently been constructed be- side and behind the chancery such that our grounds and building are overlooked by the new development.
The growth of Australia's relationship with Indonesia has resulted in a substan- tial increase in the Embassy's. staffing over the intervening period since we first occupied the present chancery. Conse- quently more than half of the Embassy staff are housed in expensive leased office accommodation. There is an urgent need for a new chancery to accommodate all the Embassy functions in a country which is arguably one of our most important neighbours. The main elements of the proposal are:
"a four level chancery building; recreation facilities to replace similar facilities at the present chancery site; and staff and visitor car parking. The design of the buildings has regard to climate and local building practice, and"

"is based on simple construction tech- niques. Australian Construction Services will produce an initial concept design on which selected construction firms will tender for completion of the documenta- tion and construction. The opportunity has been given to Australian building con- struction firms with substantial interests in Jakarta to prequalify for the project. Local materials and building technology will be utilised wherever possible but where imported materials and equipment are required, emphasis will be given to importing items of Australian origin. The estimated cost of the proposed work in- cluding consultants' fees is $13.2m at July 1990 prices."
I table outline plans of the proposed work and commend the motion to the House.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
"NURSING HOMES Form of Agreement Message received from the Senate inti- mating that, in accordance with subsec- tion 40AAl3j5) of the National Health Act 1953, the Senate has approved the form of agreement between residents and pro- prietors of approved nursing homes, pre- sented to the Senate on 18 September 1990, with amendments.

Motion (by Mr Staples) proposed:
"That, in accordance with subsection 40ABB (5) of the National Health Act 1953, the House ap- proves the form of agreement between residents and proprietors of approved nursing homes as amended by the Senate, and conveyed in Senate Message No. 140 of 17 December 1990."
"Mr BRAITHWAITE (Dawson) (9.10)- In speaking to the amendments from the Senate to the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill, I will just go through the process that this agree- ment has been through. Honourable members may recall that at this time last year the coalition moved an amendment to have this agreement and the charter come back to the House for resolution whereas it had been proposed in the orig- inal legislation that they come back as disallowable instruments. I understand that this was the first time that this par- ticular mechanism had been used in this House since Federation in 1901. The process that this has been through shows the wisdom of our proposal not only in this case but in other cases where it might be used because, had this agreement come back in the form of a disallowable instru- ment, we would have been presenting to the industry and residents a document which had been appallingly drawn up and"

"which was inconsistent in many ways. I think the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) would agree with that-apparently the Minister does agree-because in this process the Gov- ernment has offered 30 amendments to the agreement, quite apart from the 50 or so amendments that we had and about 40 amendments that the Australian Demo- crats had. So, had this come through as a disallowable instrument, the Opposition would have been forced into either ac- cepting the agreement or disallowing it in full. One can only contemplate what that would have done to the aged care indus- try and to our reputation."
"This has meant that the Department of Community Services and Health and the Minister have had to go into a form of consultation not before seen in this coun- try. In addition, I advise the House that the Opposition itself has spent probably 200 to 300 hours in staff time, my time and that of other shadow Ministers in trying to look at this document realisti- cally and to present a document which we believe will be better received by the in- dustry than the current one. I quote to the Government and to the Minister from Senator Walsh who, in one of his regular articles in the Australian Financial Re- view, suggested that this type of agree- ment and charter would be a lawyer's dream given the potential costs of litiga- tion if one tried to put in a formal agree- ment and charter things that are often contained in common law-this one goes beyond that. It was very important to heed his words."
"We hope that the amendments cur- rently proposed by the Senate will alle- ~iate a lot of those problems. The Opposition was not able in the Senate to take forward all of our amendments in the way that we would have liked. There are quite a few here. I admit that some are substantive but many of them. are basically to clarify the agreement to pre- vent potential litigation. One can only imagine, with the state of the economy today and the situation with business in Australia today, the potential for things to be sent to litigation which could oth- erwise be resolved reasonably. We believe"

4900 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

these matters should be resolved up front by presenting an agreement which can be signed and documented. In many in- stances we still believe that the amend- ments that we proposed clarified the document. There were other substantive matters on which we disagreed with the Democrats and with the Government.
"Although agreeing to the amendments that have come from the Senate, I will move that words be added to the motion. Subject to that being agreed to, we will support the document in total. I move:"
That the following words be added to the- motion:
""", subject to the following amendments being agreed to:"

Mr SPEAKER-Is the amendment sec- onded?

Mr Jull-Yes.

"Mr BRAITHWAITE-Because of the time factor, while I might come back and deal with some of the less substantive matters that the Minister would be aware of and that I spoke of earlier, there are more substantive matters to be dealt with and we seek an assurance from the Gov- ernment and from the Minister as to the manner in which some of these items will be approached."

We note that the Minister has agreed

to the request of the Australian Catholic

Bishops Conference on the subject of sex-

ual relationships in establishments to the

"effect that, if a nursing home is run by a"

"religious order, it has the right to insist"

on its own ethics and code of conduct in

order to maintain what it believes is the

tion of it religious b<;>dy might be placed

"in the interpretations. Failing that, we be-"

lieve that the scope is there to confine

"this interpretation to a very narrow base,."

In these amendments we propose that the provi- sion be extended to cover charitable and like organisations. Then-and only then- will we overcome the confusion that could arise later on."

"There have been surveys made, one in Victoria three years ago which some would say is out of date. I suggest that the posi- tion has probably deteriorated since the date of the survey. A survey of doctors conducted in Victoria suggested that while euthanasia is illegal it was actually carried out by some doctors on many occasions."

"Can the Minister assure me that his definition of a religious body-although it is not in the Act-will go so far as to incorporate the establishment of which I am a council member, which is not run"

I just want to give an up-to-date assess- ment of that. In the Canberra Times this morning there was an article about charges to be brought against doctors in connec- tion with deep sleep therapy. Three doc-

the provision beyond the very narrow interpretation that now exists.

"The suggestion that the Minister has placed before the Catholic bishops is that,"

"The most substantive amendment, while the practise is illegal throughout"

"which was argued in the House and also by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, is that relating to euthanasia. It is a matter of insisting again that a code of behaviour of an order would predominate in the choice that one would make in selecting one's own doctor. I em- phasise here that at no stage is it contem- plated by the Catholic bishops or by us that a resident's choice be limited to a doctor of the choice of the establishment."
I understand that already this is prac- tised by the order that runs St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney. It is part of its code of ethics that any doctor that practises within the hospital must agree to certain principles and that code of ethics. I think that is reasonable. It has been accepted at St Vincent's Hospital that this should be

I suggest that there are many things included in this agreement which, in normal practice and in common law, are illegal and not accepted within soci- ety. This provides. a very good reason to have a second thought about this agree- ment. We should give further considera- tion to including in it what is now accepted in the public hospital system and the private hospital system. What applies at St Vincent's on a State-Commonwealth basis should also apply here."
There is some confusion also in the minds of those in the Senate about Sena- tor Tate's reply. He suggested that the Little Sisters of the Poor had more charity and more understanding of the situation

extended to nursing homes. Some will say than the Catholic bishops. I think that

that a hospital situation is different from was a very unfair comment to make. But

The Minister would be well aware of the Catholic bishops' press comment of just one or two days ago in which they rebutted the suggestion of this lack of charity. I agree with them. The Catholic bishops and many religious organisations around Australia would want this safe- guard because they have a concern that while euthanasia might be illegal in fact it is being practised. For them to face a charge that they had less charity than other organisations would be objectionable to them. I have got to say that what is being proposed is nothing more or less than strengthening the moral fibre and the eth-

I say unique because as far as we know, it is the first time a'ny- where in the world that any government has, in this way, sought to enshrine in legislation such rights for people. It is fitting, therefore, that such an extensive process of consultation that has occurred over the last 12 months and in the 12 months or so before that has 'been under- taken.

"Finally, there is the question that has been raised that if this document is not suitable to some of the orders that run the nursing homes and no agreement is entered into, what will be the Govern- ment's position as far as funding those organisations? The question has been asked many times in the Senate' and there has 'been no answer given.

will be better understood by more people now than has been the case in the recent past.

"On the issue of doctor of choice, I gave an undertaking in writing on behalf of the Government to the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference and others that if there is a change in the future regarding euthanasia laws in any State, clause 10 (2) of the agreement will be amended to take into account concerns expressed regarding euthanasia in nursing homes operated by organisations associated with the Catholic Church."

The Government aims to ensure that

the residents of government-funded nurs-

ing homes are able to retain the medical

"practitioner of their choice, as if they lived"

in their own home. The philosophy has

"been well accepted in Australia, I would"

"hope as fully as it should be, that a person"

residents of that home. There is a very

big difference between living in a nursing

home and living in a hospital in that the

care in a nursing home should be pro-

vided in a home-like environment. In

"other words, a person should be able to"

retain the rights of independent living en-

"joyed in that person's own home, limited"

only by the communal aspects of other

residents of a nursing home.

"The Catholic Church asserts that if nursing home residents retain the right to have the doctor of choice it will lead to euthanasia. Criminal codes in each State and Territory in Australia outlaw euthan- sia. The practice of euthanasia shall re- main a matter which is properly dealt with by the police. The Government does not accept the assumption of the Catholic Church that euthanasia will result from residents retaining the right to the doctor of their choice if they enter a nursing home. As previously asserted, any prospect of such an occurrence would and should instantly become a matter for the law and the police. As I said before, if euthanasia laws in any State or Territory change in the future, the Government undertakes to reassess its position regarding doctor of choice in nursing homes operated by re- ligious bodies such as the Catholic Church."

"Over the last two years we have seen a most extensive process of consultation. As a result, we have seen tremendous consen- sus from so many places. Until this doc- ument was tabled, after thousands of hours spent with thousands of people, no-one had raised this issue. We have to ask why. On 11 November 1987 in this House, standards of care for people living in nursing homes were introduced. The first standard said, in lay terms, in easy to read terms, that residents are entitled to receive appropriate medical care by a medical practitioner of their choice when needed. As far as we can determine, that standard has been there since 1987, and the compliance with that standard by Catholic-operated nursing homes around Australia has been total. I think that says that this standard of doctor of choice in Catholic-operated nursing homes has been operating without a murmur for the past three years, until people who were not involved in operating nursing homes raised this issue as a matter of principle and philosophy. We do not deny that euthanasia is wrong, and nothing in the charter says otherwise. The fact is that this issue will be resolved, I believe, by a consensus of community opinion. For that reason, the Government has put exclu- sions into it that protect the right of the resident."
"I would like on this occasion to thank the organisations in the community that have given tremendous support to the statement, particularly on this issue. We have had the support of the Australian Nursing Federation, the Combined Pen- sioners Association of New South Wales, the Council on the Ageing in New South Wales, the Intellectual Disability Rights Service, the Older Persons Action Centre, the Public Interest Advocacy Service, the Redfern Legal Centre, Residential Care Rights, the South Australian Council of Pensioners and Retired Persons Associa- tions, the South Australian Council on the Ageing, the Accommodation Rights Serv- ice (TARS), the TARS Consumer Forum, ' the Aged Rights Advocacy Service of South Australia, the Australian Pension- ers and Superannuants Federation, the Hospital Employees Federation of Aus-"

"Mr BRAITHWAITE (Dawson)-by leave-Earlier, Mr Speaker, I omitted to mention that you chaired the subcommit- tee that was the genesis of enshrining in legislation the rights of residents of nurs- ing homes. Being humble in acknowledg- ing your position, I thought you might also acknowledge the fact that I too was it member of that subcommittee."
Mr SPEAKER-You were also a mem- ber.
"Mr BRAITHWAITE-Unfortunately, it has not been widely acknowledged that the coalition has given the legislation its full support right from its inception, be- cause the original review of nursing homes was undertaken by the Fraser Govern- ment."
"The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) referred to a report detailing the condition of nursing homes in Melbourne. I want to place on record that the nursing home I am a councillor of-the one in which my mother is a resident-like other nursing homes that are run by private and chari- table organisations throughout Australia, is conducted on a first-class basis. As far as the proprietors of those homes are con- cerned the charter of agreement between the resident and proprietor governing rights and responsibilities simply reflects"

the service that has been in place for many years.
"Too often proprietors of nursing homes are condemned because of the actions of a few. I am sure the Minister would agree with that comment. I am thankful to the Minister for providing a clear definition of a religious body because the nursing home industry wanted a precise definition of that term. Unfortunately, the Minister did not answer some of the questions I raised earlier. For example, what will hap- pen to funding if these documents are not signed for reasons of conscience by some of these organisations? In the Senate, Sen- ator Tate appeared to condone euthana- sia, certainly in compassionate circumstances. I should like the Minister to clarify the Government's policy: does the Government support compassionate euthanasia and, if so, is the charter of agreement the thin edge of the wedge as far as the introduction of euthanasia is concerned?"
"Mr SPEAKER-Order! I now need to allow the Minister to respond but the Chair will not have the debate turned into a committee debate where there is a dis- cussion back and forth across the cham- ber. If the Minister wants to respond, I will allow him to do so but the House is almost getting to the stage of wasting time."
"Mr STAPLES (Jagajaga-Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services)-by leave-I do not believe there is a need for me to respond in any great detail. I have made the Government's position on euthanasia very clear: it stands by the law of this country and has no intention of changing that law. Indeed, this is a matter that involves State laws on which Senator Tate expressed an opinion and, as such, he is the person with whom the honour- able member for Dawson (Mr Braith- waite) should discuss this matter. I have also made the Government's position on this matter clear to the Australian Catho- lic Bishops Conference, the public and this House."
"With regard to funding, it is highly un- likely that people would feel that in all conscience they could not comply with the charter of agreement. Most people"

Mr SCIACCA (Bowman-Parliamen- tary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (9.55)-1 move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
"The amendments agreed to by the Senate will impose a liquid assets test on unem- ployment and sickness benefit claimants, but only from 1 February 1991. An un- married person without a dependent child who has more than $5,000 in liquid assets will have to serve an additional waiting period of four weeks before payment can be made. A married couple or sole parent could have $10,000. Where the liquid as- sets test would cause long term disadvan- tage or financial hardship, the Secretary to the Department of Social Security will have a discretion to waive the waiting period, but only for unemployment bene- fit claimants."
"The amendments will defer until 1 Feb- ruary 1991 the date from which no wait- ing period will apply for unemployment benefit to persons who would otherwise qualify for special benefit. This amend- ment is consequential on the deferral of the introduction of the liquid assets test. The amendments provide that an assets test on family allowance will not be intro- duced, and also included are some minor and technical amendments."
"Mr BRAITHWAITE (Dawson) (9.56)- In speaking briefly on this matter, I note that it is another piece of legislation that has been a casualty of the haste of prep- aration and presentation to this chamber just one month ago. I ask the Govern- ment again to make sure that the legisla- tive process gets a thorough review. When the deeming process came before the chamber, .the Opposition offered an amendment to increase that threshold for married couples. The Government at that stage, I believe, was unaware of what the legislation intended, because married cou- ples were only going to get that deeming provision in regard to $2,000, which is the same as applies to a single person. I say again that there has been too much haste in the presentation of this informa- tion, and the legislation should be looked at more thoroughly."

Data-Matching Program Bill 21 December 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 4909

"We also understand that in the Senate the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) undertook to review the in- terest rate of 10 per cent. That rate might have been fair at the time when it was presented in August, but it certainly needs some revision now, with the downward swing. That is a matter of great concern not only to my constituents but to the people who handle money for constitu- ents who are faced with this threat."
"I refer also to the family allowance and the fact that the assets test imposition on the family allowance was defeated in the Senate. Again, the Government has got this lopsided idea that the family allow- ance is a welfare payment; it was never a welfare payment. It was a payment made as a contribution to the cost of rearing children to a standard normally accepted in society. If there is a problem in Aus- tralia today, it is that there are not enough children being reared in that atmosphere of home care and attention. I ask the Government never again to look at the means testing of what isa real benefit."
"If the Government wants to see the reality of what happens in homes that do not have sufficient income, it should note the 500,000 around Australia are living in poverty. The promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that no child would live in poverty by the year 1990 was going to be further undermined by taking away the family allowance on the assets test."
"Mr SCIACCA (Bowman-Parliamen- tary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (9.58)-1 will not make any comment with respect to what the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), has said on the family allowance, but I will say that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) is well aware of the position with interest rates. A close tab is being kept on the general movement in interest rates. If it seems obvious that it will be very difficult for pensioners to obtain an interest rate of 10 per cent, the Minister will make a decision as to whether that should be downgraded. My understanding is that he will make a decision at the end of January or early February, certainly in"

plenty of time prior to the deeming pro- visions taking effect.
Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted.
DATA-MATCHING PROGRAM (ASSISTANCE AND TAX) BILL 1990
"Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 December, on motion by Mr Howe:"
That the Bill be now read a second time.
"Mr PEACOCK (Kooyong) (lO.OO)-We have before the House the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill 1990 which, for the sake of brevity, I will refer to as the data matching Bill. After the necessary amendments that the Opposi- tion made in the Senate with the support of the Australian Democrats, we now see a much improved Bill in terms of privacy considerations and, therefore, we will not be opposing it. I will focus on the provi- sions set out in part 3 of the Bill which will make a number of amendments to the Privacy Act 1988. The provisions we find in part 3 of the data matching Bill have come about, as I imply, at the insti- gation of the coalition parties with the support of the Democrats in the Senate, and I would like to pay particular tribute to the lengthy work done by my colleague Senator Richard Alston, the shadow Min- ister for social security, who was instru- mental in moving these amendments in another place."
"The amendments adopted in the Senate are of a far reaching nature, designed to strengthen and to bolster the powers and functions conferred upon the Privacy Commissioner under the Privacy Act. The legislation we have under consideration relates, of course, to the extension of the tax file number system to the social secur- ityarea. I will not be dealing in any detail with the reasons why the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) re- quires this measure. I want to focus on the privacy considerations which I regard as all important. The Government claims, of course, that such an extension will re- sult in program savings of $65m for the year 1990-91 and $290m for the year 1991-92."

4910 REPRESENTATIVES 2i December 1990

Data-Matching Program Bill

"The data matching Bill is therefore, in- ter alia, designed to address the privacy concerns associated with the proposed ex- tellsion of the ,tax file number system by regulating the manner in which informa- tion obtained from data matching pro- grams is to be used. The aim of these measures, namely, the minimisation of the potential for abuse of the social security payments system, is naturally a laudable one. However, data matching can have a significant impact on personal privacy, and it is essential that all privacy concerns be adequately addressed. They were not when this Bill first came before the Senate."
"It is really a question of striking an appropriate balance between the need to protect the revenue, which I do not deny, and the absolute need to safeguard-indi- vidual rights of privacy. It is to this end that the coalition has moved the various amendments to the Privacy Act which we now find in part 3 of the data matching Bill. In October of this year, the Privacy Commissioner issued a discussion paper and draft guidelines entitled Data Match- ing in Commonwealth Administration. That paper discusses data matching in a general sense and, in this respect, the present measures under debate represent only one form of data matching."
"In part 2 of that discussion paper, the Privacy Commissioner surveyed a num- ber of existing data matching programs in Commonwealth administration, and it is apparent from the Commissioner's find- ings that, in many instances, such pro- grams seem to have developed more from administrative practices rather than from specific statutory authorisations. It is also quite clear that the effectiveness of the information privacy principles, which are set out in the Privacy Act-particularly principles 10 and II-are being severely eroded by the reliance of Commonwealth agencies upon general information gath- ering and disclosure provisions."
"On 7 November, after reading the dis- cussion paper and draft guidelines, I for- warded to the Commissioner some comments. In the light of the findings set out in the discussion paper, I formed the view that both the Commissioner and this Parliament seem to have a very limited"

"role in this area. I went on to suggest a number of ways in which the Parliament could play a more active role, and also indicated that there appeared to be a number of shortcomings with the existing regime for the protection of privacy. The amendments this Bill will make to the Privacy Act will go some way to address- ing those shortcomings, although it is clear that further work will need to be done."
"The history of the tax file number sys- tem-and I have to put it bluntly-rep- resents a litany of broken promises on the part of this Labor Government, and it falls upon the Commissioner and this Parliament to act, where this Government fails to, to protect rights of privacy. It fell to me to negotiate the legislation for the tax file number with the Treasurer (Mr Keating). I have never disclosed publicly the nature of our private discussions and I am not going to do so today, but it is as plain as a pikestaff that, from the un- dertakings that the Treasurer gave, what he said to me by way of private undertak- ing was matched publicly when he said that the tax file number would not be extended."
"With that good faith publicly endorsed time and again, we saw the need for pro- tecting the revenue and supported the Government, after very extensive amend- ments again on privacy which the former shadow Attorney-General, my predeces- sor, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), negotiated with the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate). With the attachment of those privacy principles, plus particular amendments that we made to the use of the tax file number itself, we then sup- ported the matter. It was to be confined to the tax file number and it was to be used for taxation purposes only."
"The present Minister for Social Security does not seem to worry about that be- cause he said in relation to that undertak- ing, 'few things are imrilUtable'. That is the sort of statement that ranks with that of the Treasurer. After the Australian Labor Party was elected to power in 1983 and the Treasurer was reminded of var- ious statements he had made in opposi- tion, he said, 'Oh well, they were just"

Data-Matching Program Bill

21 December 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 4911

"made for opposition; they're nothing to do with me in government now'. It has just been symptomatic of this Govern- ment to give undertakings which can be torn up, broken at its own whim as it seems to change course."
"Let me remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, of some of the statements the Treasurer made when he gave these assurances to the people of Australia in regard to the tax file number. In a press release issued on 25 May 1988, he said, firstly:"
The Tax Office will be the only government agency which uses the tax file number for the purposes of identifying and registering its client base.
Some undertaking! Secondly:
The tax file numbering system will be adminis- tered exclusively by the Tax Office for tax pur- poses.
Thirdly:
Exchanges of information between the Tax Office and other agencies will continue to be limited to those authorised under the very strict secrecy provisions of the tax law.
And fourthly:
The new measures are designed solely to help reduce tax evasion.
"In the debate on the 1988 taxation legis- lation, the Treasurer gave similar assur- ances to the House and, on 1 September 1988, he had this to say:"
No other government or non-government agency will have access to the Tax Office file number registration system . . .
"Just by reading those quotes, one can see the appalling record-a record which now looks like a string of broken promises."
"The tax file number system arose out of, of course, the heated debate on the proposal by Labor to introduce an Aus- tralia Card, and the community rejected this proposal outright. In a submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the Privacy Commissioner analysed the similarities between these most recent extensions of the tax file number system and the origi- nal Australia Card proposal, and there appears to be only one significant differ- ence. That is that, at the moment, there is a separation of data held in the taxation and social ~ecurity area and data held by the Health Insurance Commission relat-"

"ing to Medicare. That barrier has to re- main. If it is to be broken, then we will end up having the de facto Australia Card which the Opposition opposed, which the community opposed and which the com- munity clearly simply does not want."
"In the context of the Bill we have be- fore us, I think it can be said that one lesson to be learnt is that this Parliament, though treated with contempt by the Gov- ernment, needs-to be ever more vigilant. Were it not for our amendments moved in the Senate and the vigilance with which Senator Alston pursued these privacy matters in the Senate, we would not have the sort of legislation today which we can support and which, for all its flaws and concerns for the future, at least gives us that reasonable balance that I spoke of before in terms of saving the revenue and guarding privacy concerns."
"Since the inception of the tax file num- ber in 1988 as an identifying system, we have seen the gradual extension of that system to other areas by way of a process sometimes referred to as function creep. I recall that I stopped using the term 'tax creep' because people thought I was talk- ing personally of the Treasurer. 'Function creep' is not a new designation for the Minister for Social Security, but it does adequately mirror what seems to be oc- curring as there is a steadily evolving creeping process in which the Govern- ment involves itself more. In light of these what can only be described as somewhat insidious developments, the Opposition has taken the view that the powers of the Privacy Commissioner need to be bols- tered if he is to be an effective privacy watchdog. It is no good setting up a Pri- vacy Commissioner, giving undertakings to the Australian people and then so con- straining him in-his actions that he can- not ensure that their privacy concerns are investigated."
"The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs,- which was charged with the task of examining this legislation, in its recent report enti- tled The Proposed Tax File Number Pro- vision and Data-Matching Program, stated:"
. . . some members of the Committee felt that the statutory provisions which govern the office

4912 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

Data-Matching Program Bill

of Privacy Commissioner unduly limited his in- dependence . . .
"A stronger and more independent com- missioner can only. lead to Parliament, and therefore the public, being better in- formed of governmental practices which interfere with the right to privacy. I know that some people think that sometimes I and others go on a little too much about the right to privacy. They talk about the need to get in the revenue and to protect it. I am aware of protecting the revenue. Governments do not have money; money only comes from taxpayers. Or, if govern- ments borrow money, taxpayers end up footing the bill in terms of the interest to be paid. It is not government's money but people's money that has to be protected."
"But so too do people's rights have to be protected. There is an inclination on the part of this Government to sweep aside what has been hundreds of years of strug- gle on the part of many to ensure that the sort of freedom under the system of law that we have today is not just swept aside. Every time we erode the freedom, the privacy and the liberty of individuals by legislation, as occurred in the original draft of the Bill, we take an appalling step backwards. There has been much blood and much treasure spent in centuries past to get us to a situation where- men and women in this country can go about their lives uncoerced by those in authority con- stantly intruding on their affairs."
"Any honourable member or honourable senator who allows legislation to protect the revenue to override those concerns does a disservice not only to himself and to his constituents but also to so many who have contributed to more sophisti- cated civilisations which believe in the freedom of the individual and his rights and opportunities under the freedom of law. The question of privacy is not some academic notion. There is just no right on the part of government to intrude into citizens' affairs, unless there are circum- stances prima facie that warrant it."
"If we allow legislation like this to go through without the sorts of checks that can be vested in the Privacy Commis- sioner and with the technology that is available today, we really allow govern-"

ment to embark on the most sophisticated high technology fishing expedition that the law in normal circumstances does not allow.
Dr Kemp-They have shown an appall- ing lack of concern.
"Mr PEACOCK-As the honourable member for Goldstein would know, it is not in their mind. The nature of these people, for all that they seem to blur it, is for government control. Government in- trusion is part of their philosophic atti- tude."
"Mr Sciacca-It is not. Mr PEACOCK-The honourable member for Bowman would not know. Any man who sits on a Greek island and rings a radio station to establish that he is alive is hardly a major contributor to the debate in this Parliament. In fact, it was only when I read that he had done that that his name was brought to my attention. As in a phrase I used the other day, he is hardly a statesman-like charac- ter whose name is on the lips of all Aus- tralians if the only way he can get recognised is by lying about on a Greek island while his constituents complain that he is not looking after their welfare. It surprises me not that he would interject on a matter concerning the individual lib- erties of people in this country. The honourable member for Goldstein, who has a sensitivity to these sorts of issues which the honourable member for Bowman would not comprehend or even feel, recognises the importance of the pro- visions that we have attached to this leg- islation in the Senate. I remind him that it is only because we have addressed these privacy concerns and have got the sup- port of the Australian Democrats on this occasion that we are able to support this Bill that now strikes that appropriate bal- ance between saving the revenue and safe- guarding liberty, freedom and privacy. Because of the interjections, perhaps I ought to stay on this track a little longer. In order to appreciate the dramatic pri- vacy implications that data matching may have, it is probably necessary to consider how such programs operate. In the discus- sion I referred to earlier, the Privacy"

Data-Matching Program Bill

21 December 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 4913

Commissioner defined data matching as involving the following:
. . . the systematic comparison (usually by com- puters) of two or more sets of systems of personal data collected for separate administrative pur- poses with a view to isolating any data items warranting further action ...
"The Commissioner has described the measures which are under consideration today as representing 'an extremely com- plex form of matching . . . at the fore- front of matching techniques anywhere in the world'. That is a pretty substantial statement by the Privacy Commissioner. In other words, there could not be a more sophisticated means of matching personal data on citizt(ns than has been provided for. The fundamental premise of the Pri- vacy Act and information privacy princi- ples is that information provided by citizens to government should be used only for the purpose for which it is pro- vided. However, the essence of data matching is to allow information to be used for purposes other than that for which it was originally intended to be used."
The Privacy Commissioner has de- scribed data matching techniques as being akin to:
". . . investigators entering a home without any warrant or prior suspicion, taking away some or all of the contents, looking at them, keeping what is of interest and returning the rest, all without the knowledge of the occupier."
"That is not a bad statement by the Pri- vacy Commissioner, for whom I have in- creasing respect."
"Dr Kemp-They are very strong words. Mr PEACOCK-I agree with the honourable member-for Goldstein. There could not be a stronger statement in terms of the way in which one could relate by analogy what is being provided for. The privacy issues involved in data matching can be grouped into four stages: first, there is the threshold issue of information which is collected and used for one purpose being used for another purpose without the con- sent of the provider of the information; secondly, there is the question of whether the quality of the sets of data is of such a standard that it would ensure that the matching process will be accurate; thirdly,"

"there is the issue of data profiling involv- ing the compilation of dossiers of infor- mation on individuals based upon information that has been collected from different sources; and, fourthly, once a data matching program has been con- ducted, there are questions involving nat- ural justice and the rights that individuals should have to challenge the accuracy of the results of such processes."
"The amendments that this Bill will make to the Privacy Act will ensure that these issues are properly addressed. Further- more, the Bill as amended contains a sun- set clause to take effect from two years after commencement. Should it turn out that these data matching programs do not achieve the desired revenue savings and involve an undue interference with pri- vacy, they will be brought to an end. It is worth noting that it was only by a major- ity that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. con- cluded that the extension of the tax file number system into the social security system was warranted in the present cir- cumstances."
"The former Canadian Privacy Commis- sioner, a Dr John Grace, has described data matching as an 'insidious threat' to privacy. In 1983 he said that data match- ing:"
". . . is a far reaching insidious threat to the way our society thinks and works . . . The Privacy Commissioner must challenge computer match- ing as a tool even to achieve desirable goals. Another reason why computer matching is wrong is more subtle, yet more dangerous for that. The technique can turn the presumption of innocence into a presumption of guilt . . . A computer match is instigated not because a particular per- son is suspected of a fraud-as in a traditional investigation, but because a whole class or group of persons has come to the attention of Govern- ment for either good or frivolous reasons. Thus do old-fashioned ""fishing expeditions"" pose as high technology."
"The Australian Law Reform Commission in its 1983 report on privacy expressed similar concerns with data matching methods, describing such methods as being akin to 'the general warrant once used to search houses without discrimination or reasonable cause'."

4914 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

Data-Matching Program Bill

"Having canvassed the privacy issues that are involved with data matching pro- grams, I want to consider some of the principal provisions of part 3 of the Bill, which are designed to strengthen the pow- ers of the Privacy Commissioner and give Parliament a greater say in these matters. A number of changes are to be made to section 27 of the Privacy Act, which is the section that sets out the functions of the Commissioner. Under the amend- ments, the Commissioner will be empow- ered to examine proposed enactments, with or without a request from a Minis- ter, which may involve an interference with the privacy of individuals or which may otherwise have an adverse effect on the privacy of individuals. At the moment the Commissioner is restricted to exam- ining such enactments upon a specific re- quest from a Minister and is also confined to examining enactments involving 'an in- terference with the privacy of individu- als', a phrase which has a specific limited meaning under section 13 of the Privacy Act, relating to the Commissioner's pow- ers to investigate certain acts or practices."
"Similar changes are also to be made with respect to the power of the Commis- sioner to examine Government proposals for data matching programs. The Com- missioner will be empowered to issue binding guidelines under the data-match- ing Bill to monitor and report upon the adequacy of equipment and user safe- guards that are involved in data matching programs and to report on any matter that concerns the need for legislative and/ or administrative action to be taken in the interests of the privacy of individuals. Changes are also to be made to sections 31 and 32 of the Privacy Act, the effect of which will be that, when the Commis- sioner provides a report to the Attorney- General pursuant to those sections, the Commissioner will have a discretion, if he believes it is in the public interest to do so, to provide a further follow-up re- port to the Attorney which is to be pre- sented to Parliament. Section 31 relates to reports that the Commissioner may compile following examination of pro- posed enactments that may have adverse effects upon the privacy of individuals"

and section 32 relates to the power of the Commissioner to report on any govern- mental activities which he believes may have any adverse effects on the privacy of individuals.
"Furthermore, as I mentioned earlier, the Commissioner will have power to issue binding guidelines pursuant to the data- matching Bill which must be complied with by agencies when carrying out data matching programs. A breach of those guidelines will be treated for the purposes of section 13 of the Privacy Act as an interference with privacy. The Commis- sioner will be able to investigate any com- plaints that individuals may make about an alleged breach of those guidelines. The effect of these provisions will be to give the Commissioner a higher profile in the public debate in this area in order to promote greater awareness of privacy is- sues."
"The ever intrusive powers of govern- ment are, as I have indicated, a matter of great concern to all Australians. As I men- tioned earlier, in reference to the submis- sion I made to the Privacy Commissioner on data matching, there is a strong need for the existing regime, which purports to protect privacy, to be reviewed. When we look at the legislative checks and balances on governmental power contained in the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Infor- mation Act, we can see that the current regime really developed out of the system of government which operated on a pa- per-based administration. There is a dras- tic need for that regime to be reviewed in light of developments in information technology. I trust the Attorney-General- who does not have primary responsibility for the passage of this Bill but who is responsible for the Privacy Act-with all the resources at his disposal, will ensure that the privacy of all Australians is ade- quately protected by Federal law."
"In 1983 the Australian Law Reform Commission, in its report on privacy, ex- amined existing Commonwealth laws that sought to protect individual rights of pri- vacy vis-a-vis the collection of informa- tion by governments. In passing, the Commission made the following com- ments:"

Data-Matching Program Bill

21 December 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 4915

The indeterminate future privacy risks posed for the subject could never have been envisaged by the drafters of most secrecy provisions in legisla- tion authorising collection of information by- government authorities.
"That was 1983. In 1988 Parliament passed the Privacy Act to address the deficiencies that had been identified in the law. Now, only two years later, it can be seen that much more work needs to be done for us to be confident that the law is providing adequate protection for the privacy of Australians. There is a dramatic and ur- gent need for such a review in light of these technological developments. In evi- dence to the Senate Standing Committee, the then Minister for Social Security, the Minister for Commmunity Services and Health (Mr Howe), conceded that a pro- gram such as the one presently under con- sideration has largely come about due to developments in information technology. The Minister said:"
The main reason why we have gone further is that we can get the technology to do something that we could not obtain several years ago.
It is of little comfort for Australians to know that this Government finds it con- venient to break its promises simply be- cause it has the technical know-how to do so.
Some other examples of government proposals which have a significant impact upon privacy and which come about be- cause of recent changes in technology in- clude the proposed law enforcement administrative network and the system of computerised financial reporting estab- lished by the Cash Transaction Reports Act of 1988.
"It is imperative that Parliament, as law- makers and as those charged with being the custodians of civil liberties, be kept abreast of these developments. The pace of changes in computerised technology has outstripped the legal protection afforded to citizens. This is particularly pertinent when one bears in mind the claims of computer experts that, in light of current technologies, it is not necessary for there to be a central databank in order for ad- ministrators to piece together a total in- formation profile on any individual."

"In conclusion, we in the Opposition are prepared to support the changes that the Government intends, but we do so on the basis of the amendments that we moved in the Senate to ensure the privacy of individuals. Having done so in regard to this particular piece of legislation, we re- mind people that much needs to be done in terms of privacy and safeguards for the future if we are to ensure that. our laws properly protect the privacy of Austra- lians."
"I understand the agitation of the Parlia- mentary Secretary to the Minister for So- cial Security (Mr Sciacca) earlier because, trying to be fair on these accounts, I sup- pose the position is summed up by saying that it is easy to tip from one side to the other in terms of either the pursuit of revenue or the privacy of the individual. It is easy to state the theoretical case, but I say to the Government that, if it is so possessed with protecting the revenue, it should keep in mind at all times that it is a question of striking an appropriate bal- ance. We should be careful of any pro- posal that increases the powers of government at the expense of individual liberty. Many have written and warned in this arena. I have simply added my voice today. By the amendments that were suc- cessfully moved in the Senate, we at least have ensured effective privacy provisions in terms of the current data matching, but there is much more to be done."
Ms CRAWFORD (Forde) (10.30)-1 listened with interest to the discussion by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) on the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill and take up his concerns on privacy. But I point out to him that the Privacy Commissioner has said about the regulations in this data matching Bill that the provisions fall well short of a general purpose government and community number. I think we need to bear that in mind at all times.
The other thing which the honourable member failed to address is the aim of the Bill. What does it set out to do? Why is it introduced? What do we hope to achieve through it? The data matching Bill attempts to verify independently and automatically the accuracy of figures of

4916 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

individual client and parental income dis- closed to agencies which make income support payments.
"The Department of Social Security is responsible for payment of social security entitlements to over four million Austra- lians. It costs the taxpayer $21 billion a year. With such a charter, the Department must deliver social security entitlements with fairness, courtesy and efficiency. The Government must ensure that money is ndt wasted and that taxpayers' money is well spent. So data matching will in fact help to detect instances where persons are possibly receiving incorrect payments from an income support agency because they and their partner, children or their par- ents are already receiving such payments from the same or another agency which should have been disclosed but have not; or, in the case of sole parent clients, they and their partner are receiving home owner grant payments on the basis of a married relationship. This element is sometimes called double dipping."
"It is important for all of us to acknowl- edge and recognise that targeting must be the key to the work done by the social security payments. Such payments are in- deed the right of citizens, be they aged, invalid, family or sole parent payments. Within the Australian community, we have decided that such payments are a right."
"However, we must also ensure that those people who have the right are treated fairly and not discriminated against and talked about in common jargon. Let me assure the honourable members on the other side that it is those people who welcome-the kind of changes that occur here so that their honesty and integrity are acknowl- edged and maintained within the com- munity and so they are not subjected to the taunts of many people in our com- munity who see them as bludgers and cheats. Hopefully, this Bill will ensure that such people who attempt to defraud the system, who attempt to double dip and attempt to get benefits to which they are not entitled do not do so."
While the honourable member for Kooyong may well dispense with the fact

"that $81m was saved last year through payments being cancelled and reduced in amount for taxpayers, I am sure that the taxpayers of Australia are delighted at the efficiency and fairness of a government department which pursues the interests of all Australians and so enables our tax dol- lar to be spent properly, to be accounted for, by giving those people who need it and can prove they require it their full entitlement."
"We have heard much discussion on who is going to have to supply the data and the tax file number. Of course, it will be done across a series of departments, but we also have to remember that this data is not centrally based and agencies will maintain their specified data. The Depart- ment of Social Security will have details of persons and payments under the Social Security Act. The Department of Employ- ment, Education and Training will have details of persons in receipt of student assistance payments. The Department of Veterans' Affairs will be responsible for its own clients. The Department of Com- munity Services and Health will be re- sponsible for those people currently under the first home owners scheme. Of course, the Australian Taxation Office will be re- sponsible for those people who are tax- payers. So we see a series of departments and groups of departments maintaining their integrity and their own records, and ensuring that they all operate efficiently and effectively."
"We also see emphasis in the Bill on persons receiving income support pay- ments. Not only is non-compliance, whether deliberate or not, likely to be detected, but also penalties are associated with it, including repayment of the money owing as soon as possible and, of course, in some cases, prosecution. I think many of us view such fra4d through the social security system-and rightly so-as the equivalent of theft. Why do we send bank robbers and other people who steal money to gaol but it is seen to be all right to defraud taxpayers' money and it is some- how quite smart to be able to do so? After all, it is only the Government's money. Unfortunately, the Governmen,t's money is our money, taxpayers' money, and there"

Data-Matching Program Bill

21 December 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 4917

"is a responsibility on all of us to ensure that it is spent in the best possible way. So I repeat that data matching and the integrity which it gives to clients will en- sure that they are treated with integrity and honesty. It is those people, more than anybody, who wish to pursue cheats."
"We have all sorts of anecdotal evidence. We have heard Opposition members talk about government waste. But as soon as Bills are introduced which attempt to ad- dress this waste, which seek to save tax- payers' money and which seek to pursue those people attempting to defraud the system, those people attempting to double dip, then issues are raised which are not directly related."
"We all have concerns about privacy, freedom of the individual and the ques- tion of authority, but I remind honour- able members that, while there is a fine line, the responsibility of every individual is to ensure that what he or she does and offers is proper and correct. So those people who pay their taxes-and usually it is the pay as you earn taxpayers, who have no means of minimising their in- come-and those people who have justi- fiable and proper claims within any of our government departments have nothing to fear. The Privacy Commissioner has al- ready confirmed that and, of course, the regulations in this Bill cover that. The integrity of government departments has been maintained over a long period. The provisions that are laid down in that re- gard have been maintained."
"What then is the question? Do we see an Opposition which is frightened to em- bark on a scheme whereby approximately $300m of taxpayers' money will be saved in the long term? What is the difficulty? Is this too difficult a question? I deal daily with large numbers of social security re- cipients in an area of heavy social disad- vantage-through, I might add, years of neglect by a State government as a result of a lack of socioeconomic and social in- frastructure. I deal with people whose in- tegrity is never questioned and who are in fact delighted to have an identifying number, a tax file number, which says who they are and shows that they have rights and entitlements, who are known"

"and recognised by a Social Security office which knows they are not cheating and have no income which they can minimise. These people do not say one thing to one department and another to another. These people do not skulk off, get jobs and cash under the counter and then make claims the next day at the Department of Social Security. Those people who unfortunately are in receipt of benefits are delighted that data matching is to be introduced, be- cause they see it as a system which will ensure that integrity will be maintained."
"What will happen? How will data be verified? We have heard much about the concerns of privacy, but what will actually happen? New claimants for most DSS payments are required to provide docu- ments which establish their identity. There must necessarily be a range of options available so that the non-availability of particular types of documents does not of itself preclude payments being made."
"I know that very many Opposition members find it difficult to believe that there are people who actually have very few identifying papers. Honourable mem- bers may remember that only recently I spoke of groups of Aboriginal people who haye no birth certificates. Opposition members may be surprised to know that there are people who do not have driving licences or credit cards. In fact, there are many who have no bank accounts. Op- position members should see the parade through my office sometimes on a Mon- day morning of a series of battered wives whose husbands have dragged them, the furniture and everything they own into a bonfire in the backyard during a drunken rage on the Sunday. They-also do not have identification papers. This kind of material offers them a very real opportu- nity to prove who they are and to allow identity details to be real without their being humiliated. The whole range of sources which this information provides is important and an integral part of ensuring the integrity of the system."
"I also draw to the attention of the House the changes that will result from the pur- suing of cheats and others. As part of a review program in which 15.7 million items of changed data were processed, re-"

4918 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

Data-Matching Program Bill

"gional officers selected more than 90,000 items to follow up. What happened? One hundred and ninety-three new applica- tions were stopped; 2, 600 cases already being paid were cancelled; 447 cases being paid were reassessed and downgraded; 1,500 new overpayments were identified; and 11,000 cases where overpayments could have been made were stopped. Those are enormous savings. Surely as a government we are about accountability, efficiency and delivering in the most effi- cient and fair way to those people in need."
Mr Sciacca-Not to cheats.
Ms eRAWFORD-Definitely not to
"cheats, which is the point which the Op- position has failed to answer. While cer- tainly we take on board its concerns about privacy and the role of the individual, we also have to balance that with the needs of the individual and the people who, by and large, are beneficiaries of the Depart- ment of Social Security. They are people who are most in need of our care and concern and who most need to be assured of their integrity-that they are being paid justly and fairly and that they are not bludging on the system but have an entitlement. Imagine the extension of payments which can be made to people through savings of more than $300m."
"I am very interested to note this whole question of authority and freedom, and the role of the individual which the honourable member for Kooyong talked about. We know what the role of the in- dividual means to the Opposition. We have already heard that the dismantling of the whole program of social security is part of its operation. The Opposition is taking an excessive stand in terms of the nature of the individual-that is, if you cannot do it, you do not get it. In fact, what we see is that to those who have, more shall be given. If people are pre- pared to queue up at all sorts of grand places, be they St Vincent de Paul, Price Waterhouse or wherever, they mayor they may not get a voucher, depending on whether people have paid their tax."
We have all heard the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) making comments about tax payments being an option. This is the

"very real fear. It is not a question of the role of privacy of individuals or the role of authority; it is simply a question of cheats being caught-the tax evaders. In the early 1980s all of us can recall going to parties where it was very smart to sug- gest that one was evading tax. It has taken this Hawke Labor Government to turn that attitude around and educate the com- munity that if someone evades tax, the rest of us pay double. We now understand that and, as a community, have a much fairer and better tax system because we all have to pay. We know that Opposition members hate the idea because we hear it constantly and daily. The fact that tax rates have dropped and that there will be tax cuts never enters into their discus- sions. What they say is that they under- stand the net is wider and that people now have to pay tax. As the tax file num- ber continues to be extended, of course that is what is happening."
"The same is also true in this whole data matching process. What we see is an abil- ity by departments to ensure a delivery of service to those people in need, not to the cheats, the bludgers, the people who dou- ble dip and think it is smart, and not to those people who make assumptions that it is very clever to rip off the government. After all, it is only the government's money. We all know anecdotally what has happened and are delighted to see that last year the Department of Social Secur- ity saved $81m. We are hoping, through the data matching Bill, that it will con- tinue to save us considerably more money."
"What we also find quite extraordinary is that we are talking here about the operation of the Department of Social Se- curity, which services four million Austra- lians and has, in company terms, a turnover of $21 billion. I assume, then, that our economic managers on the other side of the House would want the most efficient and accountable operation. Surely that is what we need and are told about- that efficiency management is the key to what should be done."
"On this side of the House we also talk about accountability. It is a question of us all being accountable, whether we are individuals, managers in the Department"

Data-Matching Program Bill 21 December 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 4919

"of Social Security or managers in the gov- ernment. This Government has never shied away from the fact that government money is taxpayers' money, Australians' money, and therefore must be account- able. Any system which ensures that ac- countability and fairness are enhanced, equity is pursued in a very real way and can be pursued through a program and process such as data matching, must show initiative and drive-which is important."
"The system is people centred. There is no compulsion on people to become re- cipients of any of these benefits. If people do not wish to be recipients of these ben- efits, then they are unaffected. However, my understanding and knowledge of hu- man nature and of people who need such benefits is that they welcome these changes. They embrace them because they know that they are not being marked and pointed out as people who may be bludg- ers or cheats. They know that they have entitlements and 'rights, they can prove it and it is verified for them."
"As departments move into the new sys- tem of information collection and data matching, we welcome such a change be- cause we know that it will save all Austra- lians money and will mean a fairer, more equitable and better system. The privacy regulations ensure that the role of govern- ment and the role of the individual is adequately protected. More importantly, it is no longer fashionable or Australian to defraud, cheat and steal other Austra- lians' money."
"Mr ROCHER (Curtin) (10.49)-Hav- ing listened carefully to the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), I be- lieve those who have shared that experi- ence with me could be forgiven for thinking that we intended to vote against the Social Security Legislation Amend- ment Bill 1990. We could easily adopt the opposite view about some of the points she used to make a virtue out of the Department of Social Security having saved $81m last year. We could very well ask why had it got to the stage where it could pick up fraud to the extent that $81m was being lost. In other words, was it sufficiently assiduous in carrying out its duty in the first place? Perhaps there is"

"scope for greater savings, as is suggested by some commentators. So $81m in terms of fraud or overpayments detected last year might not be the full measure of the problem. We all know from representa- tions to our offices of examples that we take to the Social Security Department. It seems to have taken an inordinately long time to come to grips with what amounts to payments which should not be made."
"The Bill represents the inevitable exten- sion of the use to which the tax file num- ber (TFN) is to be put, which the coalition predicted at the time of its introduction. We said in 1988 that the temptation for the Government to make greater and greater use of the tax file number would be irresistible. More and more govern- ,ment departments would seek access to the tax file number in order to crack down on fraud and evasion of various types and generally to make life easier for the bu- reaucrats. It always seemed inevitable that the tax file number would increasingly take the form of a national database, a de facto Australia Card via the back door, unless the Parliament remained particularly alert to that possibility."
"In 1988 the Treasurer (Mr Keating) gave a firm commitment that the tax file num- ber would only be used by the Australian Taxation Office to catch tax cheats. In his press statement of 25 May 1988, to which the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) referred but which is worth re- peating again, the Treasurer, solemnly no doubt, said:"
"The Tax Office will be the only Government agency which uses the tax file number for the purposes of identifying and registering its client base , . , The tax file numbering system will be administered exclusively by the Tax Office for tax purposes."
"Since that undertaking was given the Government has given us a seemingly endless parade of new uses for the tax file number. These extensions have been made possible by the Government's discretion- ary powers under what is deemed to be included within the ambit of taxation law. The scheme was quickly applied to the payment of unemployment and sickness benefits, Austudy, the higher education contribution scheme and child and spouse"

"the Bill, as we have heard, relates to the wider use of the tax file number outside the Australian Taxation Office. If the leg- islation is passed, the tax file number in certain circumstances will be available to the Department of Social Security, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the De- partment of Community Services and Health and the Department of Employ- ment, Education and Training. So in all we will now have five departments with access to certain individuals' tax file num- bers."
"The information that goes with the tax file number relating to individual incomes will be matched within the Department of Social Security. The aim of this, of course, is to pick up any errors that tax- payers or individuals claiming benefits may have made when filling in forms, as well as to pick up those who are cheating the system. Of course, cheating the system has certainly been rife under this Govern- ment. When it first put this Bill forward, the' Government claimed that the infor- mation on an individual's income may exist in one government department but that the Australian Taxation Office would not be able to have access to that infor- mation. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) gave one ex- ample in his second reading speech when he said:"
"It is possible, for example, for a person receiving family allowance to fail to inform the Depart- ment of Employment, Education and Training and thereby receive Austudy in respect of the same child, although the payment of one of those payments should preclude, payment of the other."
"That is a particularly good example of what has gone on with a certain percent- age of people. This Bill will now allow crosschecking, and to some extent will eliminate some social security and taxa- tion fraud. To that extent that is a good thing. The honest taxpayers of this coun- try, particularly the pay as you earn tax- payers, quite frankly have had a gutful of people ripping off the system around this country. My opinion is that I have no objection to a tax file number being used in this way. Where people have access to the public purse, they must forgo these"

rights to make sure that they are not cheating the system.
"But I stress that, if it were not for coalition amendments, this Bill would be much closer to what the Government originally proposed with the Australia Card. Honourable members will remem- ber, of course, that, had that gone through, no-one in this country could have existed without carrying one of these cards around all the time and producing it for everyday activities. It was a draconian proposal. Of course, once the coalition pointed that out to the Australian people, well over 90 per cent of them were opposed to it. Had we not blocked it, the Government would have been brought down. It is an ironic twist that the Opposition actually saved the Government's position."
"The data that by this Bill will be al- lowed to be transferred with the tax file number will, I understand, have to be transferred physically-not sent on-line on computer-so that in that sense no new database can be created. I welcome that news. I understand that after three months, if the Minister's second reading speech is to be believed, all material has to be destroyed unless it is being acted upon. In addition, the Privacy Commis- sioner is to bring down guidelines for the conduct of data matching authorised by this Bill, and staff who handle this infor- mation will have to abide by absolute privacy guidelines so that privacy matters receive the highest consideration."
"The Government has been dragged screaming and kicking to this position over a period. It has displayed very little regard for the privacy of individuals. It is ironic that this is the case. Over the last 12 months we' have seen incredible changes taking place in eastern Europe where for the first time the worth of in- dividuals is starting to be considered. We hope that that direction continues. Sadly, that does not seem to be placed as highly amongst Government members here in Australia."
I stress that savings with social security and other cheating could be much greater if other things could be put in place. The tax file number Bill is only one measure

Data-Matching Program Bill

"that needs to be used. I would like to have seen the Government putting for- ward legislation to enforce much more than is the case the work tests for the unemployed. So often we see work avail- able in towns and cities around Australia that is not taken up. In my own electo- rate, for example, we can have asparagus needing to be cut in Narromine and a number of people in the area are on the dole, but employers cannot get people to undertake that work. I would also like the Government to consider work~for-the-dole legislation. I would like to see the Gov- ernment consider the proposal the coali- tion put at the last election that the dole should be cut off after nine months, ex- cept in special cases."
"I would particularly like to see the Gov- ernment consider flexibility in the indus- trial relations area. At the moment in the SPC Ltd factory in Shepparton, Victoria, we are seeing a classic case of employer and employee coming together as sensible adults to reach agreement. This agree- ment is in danger of being ditched be- cause of the intervention of John Halfpenny and others. If these sorts of arrangements were in place and were al- lowed, there would not be as great a need for the tax file number legislation to be debated in Parliament today. I suppose we should not be surprised about that because the Australian Labor Party is still largely a creature of the trade unions, and it is about reserving the. privilege and power of the officials through coercion. Under its constitution, I think something like 60 per cent of delegates have to come from the Australian Council of Trade Unions. That is a sad situation."
The Bill we are debating this morning is ultimately about striking a proper bal- ance between identifying fraud and pro- tecting the privacy of honest citizens in the community. It is incumbent upon members of parliament to take the utmost care in privacy matters. The whole basis of a free society centres around such con- siderations. I was particularly delighted that the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) spoke this morning at elo- quent length about this. We on this side of the. House have little confidence that

the Government is even remotely aware of these considerations. It seems at times that all too often the end justifies the means and the Government rides rough- shod over these considerations.
"There have also been many reversals that we are concerned about. In 1988 the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-the world's worst Treasurer-gave two categorical assur- ances that no other government depart- ment would have access to the tax file number in this way. In June 1988, the Treasurer said:"
We have no intention now or in- the future of extending the basis of the tax file number to do anything like some of the Australia Card tasks.
He reinforced that in September 1988 when he said:
"No other government or non-government agency. will have access to the Tax Office file number registration system, nor will it be able to use an individual's tax file number for a registration system of its own."
"One would think that we would not get any more categorical and absolute an as- surance than that, but of course those promises and those predictions turned out to be no more accurate than the Treasur- er's statements about the J-curve or inter- est rates or the current account deficit or whatever. It seems- that he is a thoroughly discredited individual amongst the Aus- tralian people these days."
"These things were overturned because the present Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) ensured that the Treasurer would be forced to break these promises by bringing legislation before Parliament doing that. Again, perhaps we should not be surprised by that. It seems that this particular power broker com- mands extraordinary power within the Labor Party. Recently he went to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and told him what to say on this leadership challenge that arose. Then he went to the Treasurer and told him what to say. When the Prime Minister and the Treasurer met for 31f4 hours saying what Senator Richardson had told each of them to say, he was watching them on a monitor in another room. That is an extraordinary situation."
Mr Sciacca-Come back to the Bill.

"Mr COBB-The Parliamentary Secre- tary to the Minister for Social Security says to come back to the Bill, but this is relevant to the Bill. Senator Richardson ensured that the Treasurer broke these promises. We have seen reversals by the Government on this issue, which indi- cates to us that it cannot be trusted. As a result, we have moved many amendments in the Senate to improve this legislation and they have been agreed to. Now the Bill is at least moderately acceptable to us."
"I would like to refer to some of those amendments. The tax file number data will no longer be able to be returned from the matching agency, that is, the Depart- ment of Social Security, to the assistance agencies. All investigations or prosecu- tions arising out of discrepancies detected in the data-matching process must be commenced within 12 months unless there is good reason to allow an extension of time."
"The Privacy Commissioner will be re- quired within the next 12 months to issue specific guidelines relating to data match- ing, which must then be tabled in Parlia- ment. A breach of the data-matching guidelines will be a breach of the Privacy Act so that aggrieved individuals will now have the same rights and remedies, in- cluding access to damages and injunc- tions. Of particular importance is that as a result of these amendments there will be a two-year sunset clause so that the entire legislation, with any alleged inva- sions of privacy and the projected reve- nue savings of $300m a year, will be able to be fully scrutinised. As well, the Pri- vacy Commissioner will be able to exam- ine proposed amendments affecting privacy or data matching and data linkage without having to wait for a request from the Minister. If necessary, he will be able to cause his concerns to be tabled in the Parliament."
"The Privacy Commissioner will be able to monitor and report on the adequacy of equipment and user safeguards. On com- pletion of an action, any information ob- tained in the process must be destroyed. There will be a general tightening of the procedures governing the program proto-"

col and the technical standards report and within six months of the commencement of the first data-matching cycle each gov- ernment agency involved will be required to table a comprehensive cost benefit analysis.
"The coalition is proud that these pri- vacy considerations are now in place, es- pecially the two-year sunset clause review of the whole legislation. Fortunately, the coalition will be in government at about that time and we will be able to adjust or repeal legislation after a proper assess- ment period."
"In conclusion, I say that the Govern- ment is to be condemned for the original disregard it had for the essential privacy considerations of this Bill. Since coalition amendments have been put in place in the Senate, we can now accept this Bill and, for that reason, we support it."
"Mr SCIACCA (Bowman-Parliamen- tary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (11.19)-First of all, I would like to thank honourable members for their contribution, in particular the honourable member for Forde (Ms Craw- ford), who made an excellent contribu- tion, and also the other three speakers. Before I talk more generally on some of the more important provisions, can I say that, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) dealt mainly with the pri- vacy provisions of the Bill. He says that he is concerned with the individual per- sonal privacy provisions. He says also that he is aware of the balance required be- tween the need to control revenue and the protection of personal privacy."
"It amazes me that the Opposition con- tinually says that it wants to reign in gov- ernment spending and that if it were ever in office it would cut government expend- iture, particularly in the welfare area. Yet when the Government tries to tighten controls over expenditure, particularly so that it targets moneys available to the Government in the social security area to those most in need, the Opposi,tion seems to whinge and whine. In other words, it wants to have it both ways."
"Unfortunately,it is not possible to have it both ways; expenditure controls are"

"tightened or they are not. Significant sav- ings will be rnade as a result of the Data- rnatching Prograrn (Assistance and Tax) Bill-savings that can be better targeted to those who really need incorne support frorn the Departrnent of Social Security and not those who intentionally defraud the systern. The Bill is not designed to interfere with personal privacy, but to stop cheats, and I do not see how anyone could possibly argue with that."
"The honourable rnernber for Kooyong rnade sorne specific criticisrns and likened these rneasures to a Clayton's Australia Card. He said there was only one signifi- cant difference between the tax file nurn- ber, the data-rnatching proposals and the Australia Card. There are at least three significant differences: firstly, this is not a national identification systern-there is no card; secondly, there is no central data- base; and, thirdly, there is no cornrnon nurnbering systern. The Privacy Cornrnis- sioner said that the proposal fell well short of a cornrnon governrnent nurnbering sys- tern."
"Both the honourable rnernber for Kooyong and the honourable rnernber for Curtin (Mr Rocher) clairned that the pri- vacy concerns were not adequately ad- dressed when this Bill first carne before the Senate. Contrary to that clairn, the Privacy Cornrnissioner was satisfied with the Bill. As far as the Governrnent is concerned, the arnendrnents were optional extras as regards the data-rnatching pro- grarn and so they are not unacceptable to the Governrnent."
"The honourable rnernber for Curtin spoke rnainly about the necessity for these provisions. He criticised the honourable rnernber for Forde, who said that last year approxirnately $81rn was saved. The honourable rnernber for Curtin should note that in a departrnent which spends sorne $20 billion and which has an ex- traordinary nurnber of offices and sorne rnillions of clients, it is not always possi- ble, without sorne forrn of technological assistance, to detect overpayrnents. I rnight add that approxirnately $73rn of that $81rn was recovered."

"These new data-rnatching provisions will further enhance the ability of governrnent departrnents, in particular, the Depart- rnent of Social Security, to ensure that payrnents go to those who are entitled to thern. I arn sure that even the honourable rnernber for Kooyong and all Opposition rnernbers would agree that they are the people who should be getting the incorne support-those who need it, not those who cheat."

The honourable rnernber for Curtin said

that he found it strange that the Govern-

rnent's projected savings of $800rn over

three years could be correct but it is not

an extravagant clairn. With the new data-

"rnatching provisions, in a budget that goes"

"up to $20 billion plus, it is not an extrav-"

agant clairn that approxirnately $266rn

savings can be effected.

.

"The honourable rnernber for Parkes (Mr Cobb) asserted that these rneasures are sirnilar to the Australia Card proposal. I will not cornrnent on what he said, apart frorn referring to rny cornrnents on the contributions of the honourable rnernber for Kooyong and the honourable rnernber for Curtin."

"Generally, the Governrnent has at all tirnes wanted this Bill to reflect a fair balance between the need for workable processes for data-rnatching and the need to protect, as far as possible, the privacy of individuals. The Bill has been settled with constant input by the Privacy Corn- rnissioner. The Opposition arnendrnents tend to rnake rnore explicit the privacy protections than even the Privacy Corn- rnissioner thought necessary. Neverthe- less, the Governrnent finds them acceptable because in the rnain they re- flect the philosophy supported by the Governrnent."

"The Bill, as it has corne to this House, can be seen to achieve a nurnber of things. It details cornprehensively which agencies will be involved in this data-rnatching prograrn. The prograrn cannot be ex- tended without fresh legislation being passed. It defines cornprehensively whose data will be rnatched. It sets out in ex- trerne detail exactly how data-rnatching is to be done. It sets out fully what results"

4926 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

Industrial Relations Bill

"will be sought from data-matching. It de- tails how information from data-matching will be handled. It sets time limits for the commencement and completion of follow- up action on data-matching results. It stresses that information transferred be- tween the five agencies involved must not go via on-line computer link; it must be transferred by magnetic tape or cartridge. This is to prevent the establishment of a new database made up of the linked, but separate, databases of all five agencies."
"The Bill also provides for notice to be given to people against whom action fol- lowing a data match might be taken. This allows them to argue if the information is in some way flawed. It extends the powers of the Privacy Commissioner to oversee these programs and to make public com- ment. It provides guidelines for the con- duct of the data-matching program, which are to be followed by the five agencies. There are tailor-made confidentiality pro- visions to protect information about in- dividuals, and the sunset clause will prompt a total reconsideration of the data- matching program in two years time."
"In summary, contrary to what has been asserted by certain members of the Op- position, as well as adequately addressing privacy concerns, we have bent over back- wards to accept not only what the Privacy Commissioner said, because he was orig- inally satisfied, but also the amendments of the Opposition. I am pleased that the Opposition, in this House at least, sup- ports the Bill as amended, and I com- mend the Bill to the House."

INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL
"1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 December, on motion by Mr Bilney:"
That the Bill be now read a second time.

"Dr CHARLESWORTH (Perth) (11.27)-The Industrial Relations Legis- lation Amendment Bill is important leg- islation. The Government sees it as being crucial to improving micro-economic re- form and bringing about changes in in- dustrial relations which will improve efficiency in the workplace. The benefits of that reform are evident for all honour- able members to see. Last night the House heard from the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) a litany of illogical inconsistencies, a story of unction. He portrayed himself as the defender of unionists, the defender of workers' rights, in part of his speech; in other parts, he indicated that there was something sinis- ter and dangerous about unions and unionists being part of the economic equation. The honourable member en- gaged in distortion and superficial asser- tion. There seemed to be the suggestion that any view held by a member of the Opposition must be fact."
"The honourable member's assertions are preposterous; a lack of rigour with respect to obtaining any evidence was plain. I respect the capabilities of the honourable member, but I am concerned that he should have engaged in such a superficial analysis. He suggested that union mem- bership in the public sector is much greater than it is in the private sector. I do not have any difficulty with the sugges- tion; that is probably the case. It was nonsense, however, for the honourable member then to conclude that the reason that people were joining unions was not in order to avoid rapacious employers. It is impossible to draw such an assertion from such facts; it ignores the various types of industries' and other factors. At one time the employers in this country were members of the Opposition parties, which were then in government. So per- haps the rapacious employers that he is suggesting exist were aligned with govern- ments of a political persuasion opposite to that of this Government."
"The honourable member suggested that it was more difficult because of this legis- lation to vote against amalgamations, and that in some way this legislation de- creased the democratic nature of union"

Industrial Relations Bill

21 December 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 4927

amalgamations and the way in which they would take place. He pointed out that three amalgamations in the past four years have been defeated by ballots of unions. But he neglected to say that on each of those occasions the number of unionists who voted for the amalgamation was much greater than the number who voted against it. So it is hard to--
"Mr Costello-And they failed. Dr CHARLESWORTH-The amal- gamations failed because of the structure that existed. The total number of union- ists who voted for the amalgamations was greater than the number who voted against. If in Higgins we had a situation where the honourable member was not elected when he received the majority of votes, he would say that that was unde- mocratic. We have to be consistent. I am talking about improving and streamlining the process-Mr Costello-How can amalgamation fail if you get a majority of votes? Dr CHARLESWORTH-That is how it occurred because it is possible in the present structure for one smaller union to bring about the failure of the amalgama- tion. Weare trying to remove that provi- sion. Mr Costello-They voted against it. Dr CHARLESWORTH-But the ma- jority did not vote against it. The sugges- tion by the Opposition that big is bad was asserted and supported by the view put by the Business Council of Australia. Of all the bodies that could make the sugges- tion that big is bad, it is hard to under- stand the view of what is perhaps the largest organisation of employers-of the 200 biggest employers in the country. The fact that that organisation should put for- ward such an assertion is something that we would disagree with. The principal argument put forward by the honourable member for Higgins was that this legislation was contrary to the International Labour Organisation con- vention on freedom of association, and that the initiatives within this legislation were contrary to the ILO assertions. He had in fact become a defender of the ILO"

conventions. It is interesting to look at those conventions to see where they came from and to look philosophically for a moment at the position that exists in re- spect of those conventions.
"In the conduct of everyday life we are involved in all sorts of associations. We are all members of a nation which is, in effect, a very large association of people who are part of the Australian commu- nity. We have a community of interests as well as individual interests. It was John Stuart Mill who said that the only real freedom that one has in society is the freedom to have one's own thoughts, be- cause once one expresses those thoughts in words or in action, immediately the impact of those can impinge on others. Indeed, everything we do in society has the potential to impact on others. There are many people in society who do not like the idea of having to pay so much tax, but within our structure they expect the benefits of being a member of our society and accept the responsibilities that go with it. In exactly the same way, it is appropriate that workers should be able, through their associations, to have bene- fits and responsibilities that accrue from them; it is perfectly acceptable that that should be the case."
"The suggestion that the freedom of as- sociation conventions of the ILO are in some way contradicted by this legislation, does not hold. The system of federal reg- istration is a voluntary one and there is no compulsion to seek federal registra- tion. Indeed, federal registration is not a precondition for the establishment of an organisation. The honourable member op- posite cited the example of the circum- stance that occurred in New Zealand. But there are significant differences. In New Zealand there are no State bodies so there is not the possibility of registration through State organisations that exists in this country. It is inconsistent to quote that; there are no State jurisdictions in New Zealand."
"The other point that needs to be made clearly is that there is the possibility of exemptions within this legislation in spe- cial circumstances, and the rights of ap- peal exist. So there is a whole system built"

4928 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

Industrial Relations Bill

"into the legislation which allows for con- sistency with the ILO conventions. It is humbug on the part of Opposition mem- bers to come here and. parade the ILO conventions. In 1948, freedom of associ- ation conventions were first established and yet they did not become part of our industrial structure in Australia until 1973. That gives us all the years of the Menzies Government, the Holt Government, the Gorton Government and the McMahon Government before we had these ILO conventions on freedom of organisation being part of the structure within our in- dustrial relations system in Australia. Therefore, it is inconsistent and hypocrit- ical for members of the Opposition to come here and parade them because they do not have a history of supporting such conventions."
"As far as seems practical, this Bill cer- tainly proposes that there will be an ex- emption structure. There is the possibility of State jurisdictions and it is the case that there is no compulsion for registra- tion. So it is inconsistent and dishonest for members of the Opposition to parade themselves as defenders of ILO conven- tions when I think they understand that this legislation is consistent with those conventions."
"It was also mentioned by the honour- able member for Higgins yesterday that the justification for the new exemption from the ballot threshold was a further case of this legislation in some way re- moving the rights of working people in this country. Sections 244 and 253G al- low for large organisations that are not proposing to deregister in an amalgama- tion to be able to apply for an exemption from holding an amalgamation ballot. In- deed, what needs to be understood is that the granting of such an exemption is not automatic; it has to be applied for; it has to be publicly notified; and it has to be subjected to a public hearing. It is also the case that there is discretion to refuse the application and to require a ballot to be held. The exemptio'n is only available to the larger organisation in an amalgam- ation where it is not deregistering. The smaller organisations would be required to hold a ballot. It is inconsistent for"

members of the Opposition to see this as something other than a streamlining and a systematising of a process which we believe needs to be kicked along.
"The legislation will improve and in-. crease the number of amalgamations, and hopefully decrease the number of unions. It is our view that there needs to be an increase in the pace of reform. We do not disagree with honourable members oppo- site on that, so this legislation seeks to alter the registration requirements, in- crease the powers of the Australian Indus- trial Relations Commission (AIRC) over demarcation and liberalise amalgama- tions. Whilst those members opposite may spend their time spoiling, I think it is understood on both sides of this House that increases in productivity are abso- lutely seminal to the process of restructur- ing in this country. It is understood that there is the necessity to overhaul awards to bring about workplace reform and to rationalise the union structure. At the same time we see it as important to con- trol aggregate wage outcomes. It is an important plank of economic policy and one which the Opposition would throw aside. It is one we believe needs to be kept in place."
"I think it is accepted that the award structure has impeded change in the workplace. For too long there have been too many narrow pathways and work pat- terns for workers. Perhaps those patterns are not suited to modern machinery or modern methods. It is clear that such structures have complicated employee and employer dealings. They have discouraged training and they have locked up industry many times in obsolescent practices. It is the structural efficiency principle, which has been accepted by the AIRC which, broadly outlined, allows for no access to wage movements for workers who have not participated in restructuring their awards. What we are talking about in this legislation is adding impetus to that pro- gram, developing fewer unions, unions that are industry based, and larger unions which are more efficient."
"Some concerns have been expressed about this procedure, and it is necessary that those concerns be addressed. But what"

We are very concerned about that and we do not be- lieve that it will function efficiently."

Industrial Relations Bill

"Mr BRADFORD (McPherson) 01.46) -The honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) is still playing games, I think, but this time he is playing games with people's jobs. He -represents a gov- ernment that is prepared to stand by while businesses, like SPC Ltd which he men- tioned, close down, rather than recognise how much things have changed in recent times. He is living in the past, and the people of Australia will be glad when he and the Government are both history as well. He talks about and uses strong words like 'hypocrisy', 'dishonesty' and 'incon- sistency', yet they are exactly the objec-. tions that we have in respect of this particular piece of legislation-the Indus- trial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990."
"Superficially, there are some attractive features of this Bill, but all that glitters is not gold. In fact, talking about glittering, the Government's performance in recent times in respect of industrial relations is somewhat tarnished-and' that is despite the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) last night attempting to compare the level of industrial disputation under the Hawke and Fraser governments. We should think about the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was for most of the years of the Fraser Government the Pres- ident of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU); and the Minister for Fi- nance (Mr Willis), who is seated at the table, is a former Minister for Industrial Relations, so he is partly responsible as well. They sought for politically moti- vated reasons to create industrial havoc around this country, and they were fairly successful in doing it."
"At the moment there are 299 unions in the system in Australia, and under the proposed legislation that number will be reduced substantially. That in itself seems to be a worthy aim, when one considers the economic turmoil that the trade union movement has forced on this nation in recent years. In fact, in mathematical terms, if one has some sort of an equation whereby fewer unions equals less trouble, certainly the Bill is commendable. How- ever, it is proposed that this reduction be achieved by increasing the membership"

"threshold for a registered union from 1,000 to 10,000, and by making amalgam- ation procedures less stringent."
"The Bill will also oblige the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to be advised by the ACTU; it will recognise the federation of unions prior to amal- gamation; and it will provide exemptions from secret postal voting. But what this Bill will do in reality is increase the 'po- tential for corruption within the union movement to the extent, once again, that there is a nexus between power and the potential for corruption. If one needs any evidence that corruption is alive and thriving in many Australian unions, one has only to look at some of the horror stories being brought to light in the Queensland Government Cooke inquiry into union activities."
"This Bill will effectively stifle the emergence of new enterprise unions and, in so doing, perpetuate and reinforce the crippling closed shop system under which we now operate and which is substantially responsible for the international uncom- petitiveness that Australia labours under these days. Worse, it will increase the already disproportionate amount of power afforded to the ACTU, and it will deliver industries into the hands of militant left wing unions in some cases. The honour- able member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the shadow Minister at the table, in his eloquent speech last night put his finger on the very reason for this Bill when he said that this Bill is simply a payoff to the Government's union mates. It is an- other payoff."
"People might be interested to know about something I was reading just the other day. The Hawke Government, since it came to office, has provided grants to trade unions totalling more than $25m. In fact, in 1989-90 the grants totalled a minimum of $6.8m. Let us just have a look at some of these pay-offs: $99,526 to the Victorian Trades Hall Council for various arts funding projects; $29,487 to the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia for performance projects, in- cluding, and listen to this one, $5,000 for work site music programs-one imagines it must be music to stop work by; $4,777"

Mr Bevis-Stay in the chamber and

The Industrial Relations Legislation you will hear it.

"Amendment Bill is an embodiment of the personal objectives of Mr Bill Kelty. Of course, we know of him as the de facto Prime Minister of this country. This Bill, as has been pointed out by previous speakers, had its genesis in a paper pre- pared by Mr Kelty entitled, Future Strat- egies for the Trade Union Movement, a paper that was adopted by the ACTU congress in September 1987. Mr Kelty quite correctly pointed out that the trade union movement was in decline for var- ious reasons, and he detailed in his paper ways by which he proposed to reverse the trend."

"Mr BRADFORD-I will stay, and I will be very interested to hear what the honourable member for Brisbane has to say. The rationale for the amalgamation proposal has been seriously and quite cap- ably challenged by several eminent trade unionists. They argue correctly that size is no guarantee of organisational effi- ciency and that it would be foolhardy to create union conglomerates that would be controlled by left wing militants."
"Mr Kelty's vision for Australia is the super union-a series of super unions, in fact-which would ultimately grant his very own ACTU the power to pursue"

One of the ways that he came up with whatever political objectives its Executive

bers and that fewer unions per industry would be more 'conducive to the devel- opment and maintenance of effective in- dustrial relations' in an industry.

"Kelty's vision is not shared by too many Australians. In fact, a number of promi- nent organisations do not share that vi- sion. For example, the Institute of Public"

The truth of course is-and I think this Affairs describes the proposition as 'the

"have experienced, that is quite a state- ment because things have been pretty bad up until now."
Mr Costello-Who wrote that paper? Mr BRADFORD-The Institute of Public Affairs. Did the honourable mem- ber write it? The Institute's Review mag- azine for Autumn 1990 goes on to say:
"If we allow mega-unions to operate across our nation we risk industrial chaos of a type never envisaged before, and a general lowering of our living standards. The ACTU, with Federal Gov- ernment compliance, is doing all in its power to bring about these mega amalgamations. The ef- fect could be disastrous for the future of Aus- tralia."
"Secondly, the Business Council of Aus- tralia bulletin of May this year says that amalgamations have the following effect:"
. . . do not address the problems to which craft and occupational unionism give rise; will not make any material difference to the number of unions operating in many workplaces; will not significantly alter demarcation divisions; and will do little to increase the enterprise focusing of bargaining.
"Make no mistake: this Bill is not indica- tive of a wide or canvassed opinion; its objectives are not to improve benefits to union members. It is the personal crusade of Mr Bill Kelty, the man who governs the Government. Its benefits-and I use that word very loosely-will be reaped by a select few union fat cats, who will be- come the power brokers with an unprec- edented mandate to dictate the terms of industrial relations practices to govern- ment and to business. I suggest that this is worse than putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank."
"Clearly, the objectives of the ACTU and Mr Kelty should not be misrepresented as national objectives. The honourable member for Higgins was very careful and correct in pointing out last night that the trade union movement as of about now can claim to represent only 40 per cent of the total work force and only 30 per cent of the private sector work force."
"If one looks closely at the 20 clauses which make up the Bill, the hidden agenda of the legislation becomes blatantly ob- vious. Proposed section 4, for example, carries amendments to the objects of the"

"Act to promote the amalgamation of unions. However, it fails to stipulate the need to develop industry based trade unions in relation to craft or occupation- ally based unions. It also fails to address the purpose of amalgamations in terms of the need to promote broader economic objectives, such as increased productivity, which is really what we ought to be doing, or international competitiveness, which ought to be a main concern."
"The Bill promotes amalgamation for the sake of amalgamation. It does not outline any of the proposed benefits of amalgam- ation simply because there is no evidence to suggest that there are any benefits. It is section 10 of the legislation that I and most members of the Opposition find most objectionable, and that truly reveals the reason for the legislation. It is, as I have said before, nothing more than a grab for power by the ACTU."
"Clause 10 amends section 118 of the Industrial Relations Act to strengthen the onus on the Australian Industrial Rela- tions Commission to consult the ACTU when considering a claim about union coverage. Imagine the delight that the Commissioner would have in consulting the ACTU on that or any other issue. The amendment will oblige the Commissioner to consider not only agreements, but also any understandings, when considering an issue of coverage. Consultation, however, need not be public. Whatever is put by the ACTU to the Commission will not be open to challenge. In short, whatever Mr Kelty and his mates say goes."
"What would happen to agreements such as the one now being considered by the Commission from the Shepparton Preserving Company, SPC Ltd. This issue was raised by the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth). It has been a prominent issue in this debate, and so it ought to be. Faced with the prospect of having to shut down the SPC factory for historical reasons, whatever they were, union shop stewards-the workers, in effect-and the bosses sat down and ne- gotiated a deal that would save the com- pany $2.5m next year."

Industrial Relations Bill

21 December 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 4933

"Rather than an across-the-board 11.6 per cent pay cut, which would have achieved the same result, a package of measures was put together by the workers and the bosses. This package included a return to a 40-hour week, reduced over- award payments, the dropping of a 17 per cent holiday leave loading by staff not covered by industrial awards, the working of 10 Saturdays or Sundays during 1991 without penalty payments and the forgo- ing of four rostered days off. It sounds like a prescription for the salvation of the whole of Australia; however, at the mo- ment we are only looking at what is hap- pening at Spc."
"In return for this offer by the workers, the management agreed to make even greater sacrifices in respect of their own remuneration, including the board chair- man accepting a 50 per cent cut in his stipend and remuneration. Further, man- agement made an offer to the workers that, when the company got back on its feet, the staff would benefit financially through a profit-sharing program. Hope- fully, when we get rid of this Government and the rest of Australia gets back on its feet, SPC will be there as well."
"When the staff got together to vote on this plan, 93 per cent of them agreed with it. In so doing, they agreed effectively to keep the union right out of this matter altogether so that they could get it settled quickly and get on with the business of keeping the company going. Predictably, of course, the unions-and especially John Halfpenny of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, one of the groups which got the arts grant from the Government, I think- have been screaming ever since."
"The SPC situation is a watershed in industrial relations in Australia in many respects because it illustrates the capacity of workers and bosses to manage quite well without the union godfathers' over- sight. We have seen that work, of course, in many other enterprises in Australia, I suppose most notably in Queensland with Power Brewing, which the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) will be aware of, and the Metway Bank Ltd. It can work if it is allowed to work. The federal director of the Austra-"

"lian Small Business Association, Peter Boyle, talking about the SPC situation, said:"
We could see the first substantial breakthrough in overturning the shackles of the antiquated and discredited system of centralised wage-fixing.
"Yet it is that system of wage-fixing that this amendment Bill is designed to pre- serve and perpetuate. The Bill should be consigned to the garbage bin. By giving fewer unions control of principal awards, the Bill reinforces relativities between awards and cements the centralised, in- flexible nature of the existing system. Clause 12, which amends the minimum membership requirement for registration from 1,000 to 10,000 will preclude the emergence of small enterprise-based unions."
"The objectives of this Bill are glaringly obvious. The Bill sets out to stifle the flexibility that in today's economic cli- mate is absolutely necessary within the union movement to allow workers such as those at SPC to keep their jobs. It is, as I have said before,nothing more than the embodiment of the personal agenda of Mr Bill Kelty. I hope and expect that the repeal of this piece of legislation and its replacement with innovative and for- ward thinking legislation will be a top priority for the coalition when it comes to government. The sooner that happens, the better."
"Mrs JAKOBSEN (Cowan) (12.05)-1 was interested in the comments of the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), not having heard him on this matter before. The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill is intended to facilitate the longstanding policy of this Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) to reduce the number of unions and structure the re- maining large unions along industry lines."
"The Fraser Liberal Administration at- tempted to pass similar legislation through the Conciliation and Arbitration Amend- ment Bill 1982, which was designed to facilitate the restructuring of unions into fewer industry-based unions. That Bill lapsed with the 1983 dissolution. Seen in this light, the Opposition's actions on this"

current legislation are particularly capri- cious and indicate its hypocrisy on mat- ters relating to industrial relations.

In his contribution last night the

honourable member for Higgins (Mr

Costello) was especially cynical given his

role in weakening the position of workers

in the past. I know many honourable

members are familiar with his position on

"these matters. It surprises me, however,"

that people who have been involved in

business and have had to deal with unions

on a large scale cannot see this as an

easier and simpler way of approaching

industrial relations than having a plethora

"of .small unions, many of which cannot"

get agreement across the board on matters

of great concern to business.

.

I was also interested in the reference by

the honourable member for Higgins to the

situation in New Zealand where the trade

union movement has had a very negative

experience from which I think the Austra-

lian trade union movement might learn.

In New Zealand there is compulsory

"unionism, not preference for unionists as"

"we have in Australia. In New Zealand,"

union dues were being paid directly to the

union with no involvement of the union

staff- at all; the union staff lost contact

with their members when it came time

faosrawcaognesseqcuuetsncaendansd~

"forth to be discussed, the employers and"

the Government were able to go straight

to the members of the union without going

through the union staff or head office at

"all. As a consequence, terrible things hap-"

pened to New Zealand workers. That is a

real problem. I prefer our system of

"unionism, where people have to go out to"

work for the money that the membership

wants to put into unions and where union

staff have to explain and prove the need

and requirement for unions in our soci-

ety. That is not to say that one has a

"terrible view of all employers, but people"

are able to be exploited unless they have

a very strong body to help them through

negotiations that otherwise they may not

be able to handle themselves.

The structure of trade unions is integral to their ability to participate construc- tively and usefully in the process of re- form in which our society is involved at

"the present time. The need to streamline the unions has been recognised for a long time, including in major economic reports from 1975 to 1990 which the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) men- tioned in his speech last night. He re- ferred to the Jackson Committee to Advise on Policies for Manufacturing Industry in 1975; the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration in 1977; the Myers Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia in the 1980s; the Hancock Committee of Re- view of the Australian Industrial Rela- tions Law and Systems in 1985; and the Australian Manufacturing Council report in 1990. In the context of the Opposi- tion's comments last night and today, it is very interesting that the reports of all of these inquiries pointed out that multi- plicity of unions is an impediment to in- dustrial and administrative efficiency."
"As honourable members would be aware, there are currently around 300 unions in Australia, representing almost 3.5 million members. Obviously that means that not every person is a member of a union. I take the point that the honourable member for McPherson made when he questioned the workers' faith in the union system. But when times are good and when there is an Australian In- dustrial Relations Commission ruling which assists workers in achieving wage increases, of course, people do not feel that they have to have a union to repre- sent them because they are getting the benefits of the union's discussions with Government and employers at the larger level all the way through the society. It is not a matter of saying that people do not need the union; they still need the benefits that the union obtains, even if the benefits are obtained indirectly, not directly. In our society we are fortunate to have a system that lets the flow-ons go. If we had a system where only union members re- ceived the benefits that unions ,fought for and found, we would have a different sit- uation and, mark my words, many more people would be interested in becoming members of a union."
"In a recent survey of 336 workplaces, it was noted that 95 per cent were covered"

Industrial Relations Bill

21 December 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 4935

"by more than one union; 50 per cent by four or more unions; 29 per cent by six to 10 unions; and 6 per cent by more than 10 unions. That same survey indi- cated that in the public sector 21 unions cover Telecom Australia and more than 50 unions cover the Commonwealth Pub- lic Service. There is no doubt, as these reports have shown in the past, that deal- ing with only one or two unions in each industry would be a cost saving and an efficiency boosting initiative. Obviously, it takes less time to deal with one, two or three unions than it does to deal with 10, 12 or 50, and it is much more likely that a consensus approach will be obtained. I understand that consensus is not a word that the Opposition favours. The Opposi- tion in many instances has preferred con- frontation. I can only assume that the Opposition is concerned about this Bill because its confrontationist approach will not be aided by it."
"The benefits to industry and the econ- omy flowing from this Bill are, as has been indicated already, quite large. Re- ducing the number of unions will make dealings between employers and employ- ees a much simpler process, as I have already mentioned, and union amalgam- ations will reduce, if not eradicate, de- marcation disputes-one of the most prominent causes of lost time through in- dustrial disputation."
"The Australian Council of Trade Unions, as the peak body of Australian trade unions, has passed several resolu- tions supporting rationalisation of the number of unions. Although some smaller unions have voiced concern over the pos- sibility of their members being ignored in a larger organisation, recent figures indi- cate that only 15 per cent of union mem- bership is at 1O,000-with 85 per cent of workers already being in such unions. So it is not really a factor that they have to worry about."
"Amalgamation ballots will be con- ducted by the Australian Electoral Com- mission. That will overcome some of the concerns about corruption pointed out by the honourable member for McPherson. I do not think any honourable merllbt:r in this House, where we all rely on the Aus-"

"tralian Electoral Commission to be elected, will allege that that body is corrupt or corruptible."
The current administrative and legisla- tion disincentive to amalgamations will be streamlined and telescoped as part of the Act. Amalgamation procedures cur- rently taking up to two years will be re- duced to a few months at the most as a consequence of the undertakings in the Act and the amendments contained in this Bill.
"A number of honourable members in this debate. have mentioned the position of SPC Ltd. I make a few points on that because I think it is an important mile- stone in Australia's industrial history, es- pecially as there is a downturn in our economy. The debacle at SPC tempts lazy thinkers, such as those in the Opposi- tion-I will not mention the honourable member who has just spoken-to target wages policy as the main problem with Australian industry. Wage cuts are a knee jerk reaction to a much wider pr?ble~, caused by poor management practices III the boom years preceding our current po- sition. They also overlook the fact that unit labour costs have been falling, not rising, in recent years as workers have borne their share of Australia's economic burden-that is, the Howard-Hewson her- itage: the $9 billion deficit and all the things we have had to do since then to overcome the problems caused by it."
"In the case of SPC, some sacrifices clearly need to be made. Unfortunately, it is the workers who are going to make more and most of them, even though management is clearly to blame for the company's problems. Fruit grower share- holders sacked five directors at the com- pany's annual general meeting in May. That was not because they liked them, surely, or approved of what they were doing to the company. Workers were not involved in any of the critical company decision-making. Now, of course, the unions have suddenly decided to be in- volved because somebody wants the workers to cut their pay. Through attri- tion and voluntary redundancy, the work- ers have already suffered a 25 per cent cut in their number. After that cut, the"

remaining staff set new production rec- ords. What more can these poor beggars do? The Opposition now wants them to go absolutely broke while working for the company.
"Mr Anderson-They wanted to. Mrs JAKOBSEN-They do at the mo- ment. I am about to explain why it is not a good idea. The SPC issue should not be held up by the Opposition as an example of the success of enterprise bargaining. Indeed, it should serve as a warning to Australian workers that, unless they have rare skills and their bargaining power is stifled by award payments, they would almost certainly be worse off in any enter- prise bargaining situation. In times of economic hardship, it is not uncommon for workers to be asked to accept wage cuts in order to save their jobs. History is littered with these propos- als. I agree that it must be tempting to the people involved as the best of two very bad options. However, it is based on a false principle and runs counter to all the rules of anti-recession economics, es- pecially Keynesian economic theory, which I realis~ not everybody in this House subscribes to. If a worker's wage is cut, he and his family have less money to spend in pay- ing the butcher, baker and supermarket operator. The multiplier effect of this con- traction in spending is phenomenal and dangerous in its impact on an economic downturn, especially in country towns and regional areas. It exacerbates and exagger- ates the consequences of any downturn. Ironically, one of the first items the work- er's family will be unable to afford will be the very tinned fruit that is produced in the SPC or Ardmona factories. Tinned fruit will rapidly become a semi-luxury item that ordinary families cannot buy. If it cannot be bought in the domestic mar- ket, the company's economic position will deteriorate even more rapidly and the workers will lose their jobs anyway. The propensity of Australian working families to expend a large proportion of their earnings is what keeps our economy going around. Talk of recession, proof of a serious contraction in the economy such"

"as attempts to cut wages, close the hand and make it into a very tight fist. That tight fist is both a symptom of recession and its cause. Saving is important in a booming economy. Spending is necessary to redress a recession. People without money and wages cannot spend."
"I remind honourable members in pass- ing of the old story of the £5 note in a small country town rapidly going broke. I am sure that all honourable members who have studied economics have heard the story, which is one of hope and credit. If people have no hope they will not spend money; if they have no credit they will not spend money. We need to have that sort of situation in order to get the econ- omy turning again."
Quite a few things have been said about the SPC situation which I will not go into at this juncture except to point out the excellent editorial in the Australian Financial Review of 19 December.
Mr Bradford-It's rubbish. Mrs JAKOBSEN-The honourable member for McPherson may think it is rubbish-I am sorry if he does-but I suspect that those on that paper know a little more about economics than he does. It is important to quote at least one par- agraph from the editorial:
"It is a familiar and depressingly knee-jerk reac- tion to a problem to insist that, if sacrifices are to be made, it should be the workers at the plant who have to make them. Not management, the banks, or the suppliers; but the workers, trying (perhaps in vain) to protect their jobs jn the face of mistakes by the co-operative's previous poor management, including several ill-advised ven- tures which lost a great deal of money."
"That may not appear to have a great deal to do with the Industrial Relations Legis- lation Amendment Bill which we are dis- cussing today, but I put it to hono~rable members that without decent amalgama- tions and large unions we will not have successful industrial relations continuing in our country. We will not save money and time that is currently being expended in negotiating with a multiplicity of groups when there' is no need to negotiate with so many people. The workers at the SPC factory in particular will be helped by having an amalgamated union that had"

Industrial Relations Bill

21 December 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 4937

the power and interest to go on their behalf to SPC and point out to the man- agement that there are other alternatives which they have admitted they have failed to take up to assist their company in a time of undoubted difficulty.
"Mr ANDERSON (Gwydir) (12.20)-It was a little misleading of the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) to im- ply that the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) had been instru- mental in his past-which seems to con- cern many people in this place-in seeking to weaken the position of workers in this country. It seems to me that he may have been more instrumental in seeking to weaken the strength of some particular union officials so as to correct something of an imbalance that has emerged, in favour not only of the employer but also of the workers. The very nature of our commitment to enterprise focused indus- trial relations is largely to give back to workers a greater degree of say and re- sponsibility in their own lives and to en- able them to have a greater input, not only to the mechanics of how they work, but also to how they might seek greater productivity that will ultimately be the only means by which they will find their way into a higher real wage future."
"The honourable member for Cowan went on to say that the Government's legislation will reduce the number of unions that cover each workplace, as though she agrees with us that having to deal with fewer unions might facilitate the negotiating process. That is fine, except that the way to achieve that objective is not the Government's way; it is our way. The Government will not have anything like an adequate effect in reducing the number of unions that most enterprises will have to deal with under the formula that is being put to us. Before moving on, I also suggest to the honourable member for Cowan that her remarks in relation to the Howard-Hewson legacy and the pur- ported $9 billion deficit that they were supposed to be going to leave us really pales into insignificance beside the legacy that her Government appears to be ready to hand on to the Australian people in terms of our accumulated external debt."

"I turn to the speech of the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth). Does he really believe that because, in John Stuart Mill's words, the only free- dom we really have is that which centres on our thought processes, that somehow forms a legitimate basis for the argument that the right to belong or not to belong to an association is not to be respected? I cannot really bring myself to believe that an educated man, such as the honourable member for Perth, can believe it, yet that is the only interpretation that I can put upon the words he used this morning. It is absurd for him to accuse us of being dishonest in seeking to pretend that we uphold the values of the International La- bour Organisation agreement, when all that the honourable member for Higgins put to the Government is that it had gone beyond even the limited reasonableness of that agreement."
"The honourable member for Perth says that no model for what we propose exists in the rest of the world. We have a model for the Government's system, a system about which nobody else in the world seems to be particularly keen. No success- ful economy that I am aware of has such a highly structured and rigid system. Now that we have a model for the Govern- ment's system, the Government ought to be extremely keen to drop it, because it has not worked very well."
"The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) in his contribution last night predictably sought to slate the Fraser Government for the industrial unrest dur- ing its period in office. I found myself asking why honourable members opposite will never tell the whole story. Why is it that we never hear anything of the lead- ership and policy development of the union movement in those days? Why is it that only the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-for reasons related, I suspect, more to the internal politics of the Labor movement than to any commitment to objectivity- seems to be willing to acknowledge the role of union leadership in the massive loss of jobs in the early 1980s? Why is it that the wages blow-out in the early 1980s was all the then Government's fault? Everyone I talk to in the real world seems"

the lack of adaptability generated under this system.
"One of the great problems is the poten- tial for demarcation disputes, common in Australia, especially if one workplace in- troduces a new or different practice or a new technology. This is acting and has acted as a great disincentive to increased competitiveness in the Australian work place. There is also an absurd lack of capacity to recognise the differing work skills and abilities of workers. There is simply not the scope to offer some reward to the worker who desires to do a better job or to go the extra mile. Nor is there- and I do not believe that we should shy away from this all the time-sufficient room to allow the shirker or the less mo- tivated to pay something of a penalty for his attitudes or for his effective perform- ance in the workplace situation."
"That is to say nothing of the almost total lack of acknowledgment under the current system of the varying capacity of different employers to pay, nor indeed, for that matter, the varying capacity of the same employer to pay as economic circumstances wax and wane. That is ex- actly what we are seeing at the moment. The very employer who may well have been able to set some upward standard three years ago may now be the firm which, through changed circumstances, finds that it is leading the way into re- duced circumstances. We have an almost total inability to cope with the realities of life in that way."
"As we move away from this model, from this craft or trades union based ver- sion, we come to a fork in the road. The Government is choosing the wrong road, the road that is marked 'industry based unionism'. It runs directly counter to the way that we on this side believe that we must go. Judging by all the evidence, the interesting thing is that increasingly most Australians plainly are with us on this side of the debate. The road that they are increasingly evidencing that they want to go down, and which we certainly want to support them in, is the one marked 'en- terprise focused organisation'."

"This legislation actually walks in the opposite direction to enterprise bargain- ing. It rejects the idea that small is beau- tiful and instead goes the Australia Reconstructed, Swedish style, big is beau- tiful way. It might be very instructive if some of those people who went to Sweden in 1987 and who came back telling us how wonderful it all was over there were now to return and have a close look at where Sweden is at the moment, and then come back to Australia and tell us what we might reasonably expect if we follow that Swedish model, that big is beautiful approach. It is not attractive, and I do not think it is relevant for Australia. I do not think very many Australian workers would be particularly impressed by it."
"This legislation proposes-obviously I am hashing over ground that has been covered many times here today-to re- quire unions seeking registration under the Act to have a membership of 10,000, rather than 1,000 as at present, and it enhances the role of peak councils, which essentially means the ACTU. It amplifies the powers of the Industrial Relations Commission to grant preference to union members and it provides a procedure to make union amalgamation easier."
"It is, of course, true, as the honourable member for Higgins pointed out last night, that there is nothing currently preventing unions from amalgamating as they might themselves see fit. All that is required is one-quarter of the members of a union to vote and more than one-half of those vot- ing to vote in favour of amalgamation- that is to say, one-eighth of the member- ship of a union can secure an amalgama- tion. The fact that so few unions have amalgamated is surely evidence of the re- luctance of trade union members to go down that road. Accordingly, we find that the Parliament is being asked to intervene to make union amalgamation more attrac- tive or, perhaps I should say, harder to resist."
"The purpose of the Bill is to do by legislation that which most union mem- bers have not been interested in doing by choice. The last few days have seen plenty of evidence that many Australians want to do it our way, not the Government's"

4940 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

big is beautiful way. They have been vot- ing with their feet for enterprise focused approaches to the current problems that they face in their workplace situations and which they see as threatening not only their job security but also the future of Australia's economic performance.
"There have been plenty of references both to SPC Ltd and now the Prospect County Council (PCC) in this debate. The principle of enterprise focused organisa- tions is that all employees of a firm or enterprise will identify-and identify in terms of the pursuit of their own inter- ests-as belonging to that unit, regardless of the functions that they actually per- form within the unit. This is the model which might best serve the desperate need for the common identification by employ- ees and employers together of mutual in- terest and advantage, and by extension maximise prosperity and job security. This is the option most likely to allow for the rebirth of drive, initiative and genuine consensus in the Australian workplace. This is, I would suggest, to take the high view of Australian workers and their ca- pacity to display commonsense and bal- ance and sensibility in the exercise of choice in their lives."
"I never cease to be amazed by what seems to me to be the contrast between the rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) about the need for us to be a clever, fairer, more compassionate society on the one hand-that is a high view of the Australian people-and his talk of in- dustrial reality on the other hand, which always seems to lead into a situation of taking a low view of the Australian work- ers' capacity to do things sensibly and not resort to industrial anarchy whenever they are given the opportunity for some free- dom and some movement."
Mr Tim Fischer-Regulation and pro- tection.
"Mr ANDERSON-That is right. The Prime Minister tells us that the Australian people are intelligent, capable and clever on the one hand and then needing a po- liceman in industrial relations on the other hand, because without the policeman workers will resort to industrial anarchy."

"The policeman is the so-called wages pol- icy under Labor and the accord, waving the big stick of loss of jobs."
"I believe that that is patronising in the extreme to the Australian people. We need an enterprise-based model which will al- low for the inevitable ups and downs of economic activity and opportunity with- out sacrificing jobs and viability every time there is a down and which allows everybody .to benefit fairly when the ups come. Despite the rhetoric of those with vested interests in the retention of the present highly centralised system, that is the best way to improve the real living standards of Australian workers. That is what SPC and Prospect is all about."
Before my speaking time comes to an end I would like to counter all the refer- ences to one set of editorials with a com- ment from Mr McGuinness who wrote some interesting comments in the Austra- lian on 20 December. He said:
"If the Federal Government were in fact inter- ested in micro-economic reform and putting the Australian economy on an efficient and interna- tionally competitive basis, it would have wel- comed the trade-off of award conditions for employment agreed between the management and employees of the SPC cannery in Shepparton."
"If it believed in policies which softened and spread the impact of recession created by its own policies, if it believed in the abolition of poverty rather than the rampant power of the union movement, it would be welcoming the deal also."
"And if it genuinely believed in industrial de- mocracy, it would be taking a great interest in the offer by the SPC cannery management to its workers of a profit-sharing deal on terms negoti- ated between them and the management."
"Finally, I turn briefly to the PCc. I would like to quote some remarks by Mr Keith Lumsden. He has entered into an arrange- ment where he has traded some condi- tions in return for a handsome pay increase-the workers get more money, the Council gets more work for less outlay and everyone wins except perhaps the in- dustrial relations club. Mr Lumsden, one of the Council's eight main superintend- ents, is more than happy about this. He has personal use of a car, as well as a 7 per cent pay rise and, where necessary, he is prepared to work many hours more than he might have before. He says:"

Industrial Relations Bill

21 December 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 4941

As a package I can't see anything wrong with it. I believe Australia and industry have got to start and look at what we have got which isn't in sync with the rest of the world.
We've got to use our skills-and staying at home won't get us out of the mire.
"In short, he is prepared to go looking for the leadership which is not being pro- vided from the sources we might reason- ably expect it to come from. It is apparent that many Australians feel that the trade union movement is becoming increasingly irrelevant. We heard last night that only 30.8 per cent of the private sector work force now--"
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr us
Scott)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired.
"Mr BEVIS (Brisbane) (12.40)-On this our last sitting day prior to Christmas, in deference to some of my colleagues I will endeavour to be briefer than I might oth- erwise be on this topic."
"Effective industrial relations and a proper wages policy are central to the effective management of the economy as a whole. The Hawke Government's re- cord in industrial relations and in the creation of industrial peace is impressive by any measure. The number of days lost due to industrial action is down some 62 per cent during the period of this Govern- ment compared with that of the former Liberal Fraser Government. The number of days lost in the year ended August 1990 is the lowest annual figure since 1967. In fact, the number of days lost in the month of August this year was the lowest monthly figure since 1964. By any standard that is an impressive result and it is an indication of the consensus, the consultation and the cooperation which the Hawke Government has been able to foster, not just with the trade union movement but with the industrial rela- tions fraternity and the employer groups centrally involved in that. It stands in marked contrast to the sorts of divisions, strikes and bans that so characterised the 1960s and 1970s."
"As a union official during some of that time, for 13 years from 1977 until early this year, I in fact witnessed first-hand that change in practice and that change"

"in psychology. Those days of knee-jerk reactions to situations, when stop-work meetings and strikes were the first deci- sion taken by employee organisations, have changed dramatically to a situation where now unions, and the peak council in particular, take a leading role in this country in fostering a debate about sen- sible management of our resources, equi- table distribution of our wealth and the transformation of our economy so that it is genuinely more internationally compet- itive. This Bill is part of that process. It represents another example of the Hawke Government's commitment to foster micro-economic reform."
"Over the last few days in preparing this speech I was not sure exactly what I would say, but I received some inspiration from honourable members opposite after listen- ing to the debate yesterday and this morn- ing. I want to comment on some of those things that were said during this debate. The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), in what really I imagine was an irrelevant aside, referred to the arts programs and the funds that have been expended there. Given that the time is short, I will not spend long on that but I want to make one comment given that it was introduced into the debate. I find it more than passing strange that there is somehow an error in the Government's policy-that it is somehow improper-in providing funds for musical productions, arts and the theatre at workplaces, deliv- ered in consultation with unions; yet it is a virtue to spend many times more than that on operas and large theatre groups. If those opposite in fact claim that those services and those cultural activities have no place amongst the workers or that they have no place in the work environment, it seems to me that their position is yet again an example of cultural arrogance that some on the Opposition benches con- tinue to hold."
The Opposition and the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) yester- day referred to SPC Ltd as though it were in fact some guide to the future direction that industdal relations should take. A number of references have already been made to it and to the press coverage of

4942 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

Industrial Relations Bill

it. I wish to refer to some of that press coverage and to quote some passages which have not yet been written into Hansard. The Australian Financial Re- view of Monday 17 December summed up the position at SPC by saying:
. . . the SPC deal is a classic case of a workforce picking up the tab for management's failed div- ersification strategy.
Let us put the blame squarely where it rests rather than talk about employees now giving up their conditions. On Wednesday of this week the Australian Financial Re- view commented:
"It is a familiar and depressingly knee-jerk re- action to a problem to insist that, if sacrifices are to be made, it should be the workers at the plant who have to make them. Not management, the banks, or the suppliers, but the workers, trying (perhaps in vain) to protect their jobs in the face of mistakes by the co-operative's previous poor management, . . ."
"How anyone opposite can point to SPC as an example of the sorts of industrial relations that we should foster is a dis- grace. In effect, the Opposition wants the workers to pay the price for bad manage- ment decisions-decisions which they were never consulted about, much less involved in. As the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) quite properly pointed out, now that the company is in grave difficulty it turns to the workers- not for advice but for sacrifice. That is a totally hypocritical position to adopt, but it does illustrate the relative bargaining position of the two groups, which I intend to refer to later when I make some com- ment about the freedom of choice-words so often bandied about by those opposite but seldom analysed."
"Employers and the Opposition have often complained about union power, and we have heard it again today. Yet, when it suits them, the same people will com- plain that union leaders do not have the wherewithal to deliver on agreements. I have been at meetings as a union official where agreements have been reached and where, as a responsible union official in a democratically organised employee group, I have given commitments to go back to my members and to recommend those decisions. I have had the same people on the other side of the table tell me, 'But"

"you are the leadership of the union. Why can't you agree and sign on the dotted line?'. The same people who in other cir- cumstances complain about union leaders having too much power argue, when it suits them, for. those union officials to have greater power."
"The honourable member for Higgins claimed that the Opposition would re- move unions from collective bargaining processes and help workers to set their own conditions. That view has been echoed in a number of the speeches that we have heard from those opposite. We have heard a lot about freedom of choice and the rights of individuals. I must say that I find it a little difficult to accept that from some people, including the honour- able member for Higgins-a person whose name in industrial relations was made by destroying unions and helping employers to reduce working conditions. The asso- ciation of those opposite with the H.R. Nicholls Society and with benchmark de- cisions such as in the Dollar Sweets dis- pute some years ago indicates their real intention in these matters."
"I ask: why is it that those opposite ar- gue that we should go outside of the in- dustrial relations system, outside of the Industrial Relations Commission, outside of the negotiating table between unions and employer groups? Why do they say that we should move from that system? What is their motive? Is it to increase the conditions of employment and salaries for those people in the piaces concerned? Of course, it is not. They have no desire to increase the living standards and the sal- aries of those people who they seek to represent. In fact, there is no need to go outside the established system because the current Industrial Relations Act-and this Bill does not affect this matter-allows for enterprise-specific awards or agree- ments to be signed and entered into force. There is no need to go outside of the current system. The current system caters for it. That too was recognised in the SPC case quite properly by the Australian Financial Review, again on Wednesday 19 December, when it stated:"
". . . a far less high profile and ""official"" ap- proach was available to the company through a"

Industrial Relations Bill

21 December 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 4943

"certified agreement under Section 115 of the In- dustrial Relations Act, which offered the parties the chance to sit down and work out an unortho- dox solution to a pretty orthodox problem. But ""cleverness"" has not shown itself in this particu- lar episode."
I have to say that nor has cleverness shown itself in the contributions of those opposite to this debate.
"The real agenda of those opposite and the people they represent is to remove altogether the wage determination process from the industrial commissions. Make no mistake, that is the real intention. Other people on this side of the House have pointed in the debate to the fact that if those opposite adopt their enter- prise bargaining approach across the country and if only one per cent of Aus- tralian enterprises establish unions, we will have not the 300 unions we have now- which .is about 10 times more than we need-we will have 8,000 enterprise unions. Imagine the degree of equality that would exist for people in that situa- tion."
We have only to look at the Opposi- tion's performance in States where it has control of State parliaments and has en- deavoured to adopt enterprise bargaining. There is no better example than my own State of Queensland. The former National Party Government introduced voluntary employment agreements which had no reference whatsoever to the Industrial Commission and which were specifically designed and set out to ensure that the conditions of those people affected were of a lesser standard than those set out in an award.
"Time for this debate is fast evaporating. I wish to make only a few more points in the limited time available to me. Mention has been made of collective bargaining and the freedom for individuals to nego- tiate. In fact, the honourable member for Higgins, if I recall correctly, went so far as to claim that workers want to know why they can negotiate the price of things they buy but not their own labour. I am not sure where the honourable member for Higgins shops, but I suggest he go down to his local Coles or Woolworths supermarket and have- a go at negotiating"

"the price of the bread and the meat and the rest of the food he buys over the counter. He might try it at Myers when he does his Christmas shopping. He might even go to the bank to try to negotiate interest rates on his loan and his invest- ments'. It is there that we start to see some of the answers. In each of those cases, if people are big enough and powerful enough and rich enough, they can in fact negotiate a reduction. They can bulk buy and invest big sums of money, but ordi- nary people in this country who try to do that cannot."
"If an ordinary person were to front up to an employer and say 'These are the conditions I want to work for', what chance would that person have of negoti- ating a meaningful and effective agree- ment? Where is the parity in that negotiation? It is patently clear that there is no equity in that situation, none what- soever. If honourable members opposite do not recognise that, they should realise it was recognised in this country in the early part of our Federation, wheri our current"" system of establishing an inde- pendent umpire to sort things out was determined. That was in 1904, if memory serves me correctly. That situation has existed throughout the history of this na- tion and it has served the people well in establishing some equity."
"Honourable members opposite appear to have a yearning to go back to those days of enterprise bargaining, back to the days when trade unions were not in a position to represent the members and workers of this country. There is some irony that, as we approach the end of the 1990s, next year marks not only the cen- tenary of the formation of the Labor Party in this country but also the centenary of the great shearers' strike of 1891, which many people will know set the course not only for the formation of a political party but also for a great trade union move- ment. In pursuing the course they now pursue, those opposite have evidenced their own desire to turn back the clock to the last century."
"There are many other things that I wish to say in this debate, but time does not permit me. I conclude by making some"

4944 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

Industrial Relations Bill

"reference to the actual number of people affected by this Bill. When we consider the position of those opposite, we have to wonder how widely this net is cast. In fact, if we have a look at the figures for federally registered unions to see how many of them have fewer than 10,000 members, we discover that there are some 90 federally registered unions with an av- erage membership of 2,306. If we con- sider the entire country, with an average union membership of 2,306 by anyone's estimate that is a relatively small organi- sation. Moreover, these unionists repre- sent only 7 per cent of the trade union movement's membership."
"This is a trade union movement mem- bership which we are repeatedly told by those opposite is reducing. There is con- flicting evidence on that point, but I am quite willing to concede that as a trend that has been the case. Trade union mem- bership stands at somewhere around the 42 to 52 per cent mark, depending on which gauge one chooses to use. That in itself is worth commenting upon. Honour- able members opposite have complained bitterly about closed shops. They have complained bitterly about compulsory unionism. In the next breath, they have told us that half the number of employees are not in a union at all. . If there is no freedom of choice, as those opposite would have us believe, I wonder what it is that the other 50 per cent of the work force do in order to get out of what those opposite claim they have no choice in getting out of. Those opposite have based their argument on absolute nonsense. It is an argument pred- icated on assisting the privileged yet again. This Bill has important aspects of equity underpinning it. It has important eco- nomic issues underpinning it and it will provide yet again an opportunity to im- prove micro-economic reform at the workplace."
"Anyone who has been involved in those negotiations, either on the employer or the employee side, will know that one of the impediments to changing work prac- tices is the multiplicity of unions. The measure introduced by. this legislation is a good one. It deserves the bipartisan sup-"

port of this chamber because of the im- provements it will make to our economy and to the living standards of Australians. It is a pity that those opposite have their minds set in the 1890s and not in the 1990s.
"Mr SHACK (Tangney) (12.56)-1 am pleased to rise in this debate to join my Liberal and National Party colleagues who have spoken today and last night in this chamber and in the Senate, where this legislation was originally introduced, to voice our implacable opposition to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amend- ment Bill. We opposed the Bill in its orig- inal form and we oppose the Bill as it now comes into this chamber as amended by the Senate. Our opposition is rooted in a fundamental opposition not just to the specific terms of this legislation but to the Government's overall industrial rela- tions approach. Far from being reform, this Bill is in fact regression."
"The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) asks the somewhat rhetorical questions of our side: why is it that we wish to move outside of the industrial relations system? Why is it that we wish to move outside the Industrial Relations Commission. The simple answer I give him, and it will characterise my remarks in this debate, is that it is because we wish to move to a more flexible, more efficient, more productive and more com- petitive economy. That is what industrial relations is all about if Australia is going to achieve the potential that we would wish it to achieve for our children and their grandchildren."
"We place the Government on notice that, when the sides swap after the next election, not only will we undo this legis- lation but also we will introduce a policy and give effect to it by legislation which will do away with the effects of this Bill. They are wrong in principle, they are wrong in practice and they are wrong in direction."
"This Bill has two main features that have been well canvassed by others, and I will simply recall them. Firstly, it seeks to provide the legislative framework for the marketplace whereby there will be a"

Industrial Relations Bill

21 December 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 4945

"reduction in the number of unions. On the figures available to me, there are cur- rently 299 unions. This legislation; as now amended by the Senate, seeks to bring about a situation whereby there will be only 65 unions; prior to the principal amendment in the Senate, it would have been an even lower number of 46. The first thing this Bill"" seeks to do is to pro- vide the legislative backup to reduce the number of unions in this country."
"Secondly, this Bill seeks to further en- trench and extend preference to trade unionists in the Australian' work force. If we listen to Government speakers, as I have done in this debate, if we read or listen to some of the more prominent trade union officials, and especially the Australian' Council of Trade Unions (AC~U) executive, they argue that fewer and larger uriions will better serve their members. They also argue that fewer unions per industry will, by itself, bring about a more efficient and effective indus- trial relations system. That is the major thrust of their debate in support of this legislation. '"
"As pointed out bist night by our major spokesman in this debate, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the reality underpinning the legislation'is that it isa Bill Kelty and Australian Council of Trade Unions attempt to arrest the decline in union membership. The pre- vious speaker, the honourable member for Brisbane, recognised that there is a de- cline in union membership in Australia, and without playing with figures, the lat- est figures that I received from the Parlia- mentary Library this morning, across all sectors, reveal that approximately 41 per cent of the Au~tralian work force belongs to a' trade union."
"The Bill seeks to arrest that decline in union membership, which is now down to only 41 per cent and is lower in the private sector. The Bill also seeks to cen- tralise ACTU control. This is not a unan- imous view within the trade union movement and there are some significant figures, in New South Wales especially and on the right wing generally, who are not' happy with the Bill. Honourable members do not have to take my word"

"for it as to its main thrust; they need only go back to some original work from Bill Kelty, who wrote and published a paper in May 1987 entitled, 'Future Strategies for the Trade Union Movement', which w~s adopted by the ACTU Congress in September of that same year."
"In that paper, Mr Kelty argued that the trade union movement was in decline for a number of reasons and he put forward a series of proposals to reverse the proc- ess. One of those proposals, 10 and be- hold, was a reorganisation of the trade union movement to reduce the number of unions in Australia from about 325, as it was three years ago, to about 20, accord- ing to broad industry categories. That is the origin of this particular Bill."
"That Kelty paper was further expanded into a more elaborate and glossy publica- tion entitled, 'Can Unions Survive?' by the then Secretary of the ACT branch of the Building Workers Industrial Union, Mr Peter Berry, published in September 1989. Honourable members should not be surprised to learn that Mr Berry is now a consultant to the Federal Minister for In- dustrial Relations, Senator Peter Cook, and the Victorian Minister for Labour, Mr Neil Pope; and it was Senator Cook who introduced this Bill into the Senate."
There could be no greater policy gulf in Australian politics today than that be- tween the current Government and the Opposition in this policy area of indus- trial relations. It is manifest in part by the Bill and in the marketplace it is cur- rently manifest in part by the circumstan- ces surrounding the SPC dispute.
"I want to underline the Liberal-Na- tional Party coalition position on indus- trial relations. We have a published policy which has been in existence since 1985. Since the subsequent elections that took place in 1987 and '1990, we have refined this policy in minor respects. It is a well- developed, coherent document which is a blueprint for our action when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is Prime Minister after the 1993 election."
"We believe in trade unions because we believe in the right of people to join trade unions, if that is their wish and desire. It"

4946 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

Industrial Relations Bill

is spelt out clearly in our policy: the Lib- eral and National parties believe that unions have an important role to play in representing the legitimate interests of their members. We welcome responsible unionism and support the right of all em- ployees to join a union.
"We have heard drivel from Govern- ment members alleging that the Opposi- tion is somehow anti-trade union. In terms of our belief in people's rights in a free and democratic society such as ours, we strongly believe in unions and the right of people to join unions. With that op- portunity and privilege, however, there is a converse side because we equally be- lieve in the right of people not to join, the freedom to associate, the freedom to dissociate and the freedom to not even associate in the first place. The two go hand in hand and therein lies the big gulf between the Opposition and the Govern- ment because the Government believes in civil conscription into the trade union movement."
"The Australian Labor party (ALP) be- lieves in compulsory membership, closed shops and preference clauses. We will have no truck with or bar of that sort of mo- nopolistic, undemocratic view of people's rights in society. The honourable member for Brisbane, who regrettably has left the chamber, said that we should not be wor- ried about this anyway because trade union membership is declining-'What are we complaining about? It is only going to affect a small number of people in existing unions'."
"The great problem about compulsory membership, closed shops, and preference clauses is that the 41 per cent of the population who are members of unions populate the major manufacturing sector of- the Australian' economy, the very sec- tor that is uncompetitive arid inefficient. If we are not to rely simply on the farm and the mining industries, that is the very sector we need to reinvigorate and make more efficient, productive and competi- tive. This trade union-ALP Government VIew of life, strikes directly counter to that."

"The Liberal-National Party also be- lieves in the right of people to join a union of their choice. We reject the disen- franchisement of trade unionists, embod- ied in the Bill: not only: will we join a union but we will join the union that we are told to join-a big one. We reject that totally. In underpinning people's right to join,the union of their choice, we say to thein, 'Join the union of your choice'. That is why there is a gulf between the Government and the Opposition on both this legislation and industrial relations generally."
"Finally, we believe. in the right of unions to represent their members but to do so democratically and in a way in which they are accountable. to their members at all times, and in a way whereby a trade union elite cannot and will not be allowed to dictate to the grassroots ,rank and file membership. That is why in our. policy -to pick out another clause-we say a Liberal-National Party government will strengthen the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act relating to secret ballots, to make ballots compulsory before, for ex- ample, industrial action. We are going to give legitimate effect to our belief in the accountability of trade unions to their members."
"We have in prospect a greatly improved industrial relations future, climate and culture in this country where there will be more unions. We have no problem with there being more unions; reducing the number of unions will not solve Austral- ia's problems. Under the next Liberal- National Party government there will be more unions which will be enterprise based. They will democratically represent all the employees within a particular en- terprise across crafts and classifications. We look forward to an environment where multiskilling will be the norm and not the .novel exception, and where demarcation disputes will, thankfully, be a thing of the past."
This is not fanciful rhetoiic on our part because it is happening now. The reason why only 41 per cent of the population belong to a trade unionis that the major- ity of former members .escaped to the small and medium business sector where

Industrial Relations Bill

21 December 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 4947

"this sort of relationship between employ- ers and employees is happening already. It is happening in hundreds of small busi- nesses around the country-small busi- nesses in which the ageing dinosaur of the ACTU does not have a disruptive pres- ence, let alone an influence."
"I heard a call from the honourable member for Brisbane for bipartisanship, but we will only make progress in this country if we understand that the very best industrial relations are not made in the boardrooms. or meeting rooms of the Confederation of Australian Industry or in the boardrooms or meeting rooms of the ACTU or under the umbrella of the industrial relations club. The best indus- trial relations outcomes are achieved and will be achieved by freeing up the system where there are direct negotiations at an enterprise level between employers and employees. In some cases that will be be- tween an individual employee and his or her employer. But in the vast majority of cases-and I address again directly one of the arguments raised by the previous speaker-it will be between enterprise unions representing many individuals at that particular enterprise, negotiating di- rectly with their employer."
"We need to achieve a great sea change, a great cultural change in this country because we will survive in an unforgiving, chillingly competitive world only if we realise that management and employees are all in the same boat; we all have to have our hands on the same oars; we all have to be pulling at the same time and rowing in the same direction.- That is the only way that we will become more effi- cient, more productive, and more com- petitive."
"The SPC Ltd dispute has featured large in this debate because it is the most cur- rent. But it follows in a long line-Mudg- inberri, Dollar Sweets, SPC-and they are only the ones we hear about because they make the major dailies and the major press. Let us look at it at arms length. SPC is a company well known to all of us who eat tinned fruit. It has got into trou- ble through bad management decisions- no one denies that-and because of the declining market for its products. What"

"happens? The new management-the old lot were sacked; they have paid the price and members opposite must not say they have not-sat down with the work force and said, 'We are in a lot of trouble. We have got to do this and that to save our company, to save your jobs, to turn our operation around and get back into prof- itability'. They all agree. The major spokesman is the union representative. I heard him on the World Today program saying that the workers agree; it is what they want to do. He speaks for the entire SPC work force. Incomes Halfpenny- thug that he is-and says, 'You cannot have a mind of your own. You cannot try to protect your own job. You are threat- ening trade union power and dominance'. Thug! That is why there is a gulf between the Opposition and the Government. It is one of the principal reasons why the Gov- ernment will be kicked out-the public will not have a bar of it."
"Let me finish by saying something about wages. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) views himself as the Placido Domingo of Aus- tralian politics. He is the Milli Vanilli of Australian politics because he pretends he has achieved something which he has never created; he pretends he is creating growth when we are going backwards at 100 miles an hour. He criticises us long and loudly about our wages policy, saying that we have opposed every wages in- crease since the year dot. What we are opposed to is the way in which wages are currently determined. In this country we currently pay ourselves in accordance with what we cost. What we should be doing is paying ourselves in accordance with what we earn. While we continue to pay ourselves in accordance with what we cost, we will go backwards; we will continue to go backwards in the chillingly competitive environment that is the world market place. It does not owe us a thing. If others can beat us to markets, they will."
"Labour costs are such an important part of our export competitiveness, but if we could pay ourselves in accordance with our productivity, on an enterprise by en- terprise basis or even an industry by in- dustry basis, we would all be in favour of higher wages because the higher the pro-"

4948 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

"ductivity the higher the wages. If we paid ourselves in accordance with what we earn and produce, we would all be in favour of higher wages because wages against that backdrop would be nothing more nor ,less than the work force's rightful share of its increased output. Members opposite must not give us that rubbish about our being opposed to wage increases. We are op- posed to wage increases of the wrong sort. We are definitely in favour of wage in- creases of the right sort."
"The ultimate canvas against which we try to paint this picture -is the appalling international debt that is now owed by Australia-$150 billion. We are now rear- ing the first generation since 1901 which will inherit a lower standard of living than its parents. My parents worked hard, for sure. But they knew deep down that if they did the -right thing as a 1950s-1960s couple, their children, my brother and I, would do better than they did. My wife and I are trying to repeat the same expe- rience, as are all Australian families. But we know that our children willnot repeat that experience; they will be worse off."
Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! The honourable mem- ber's time has expired.
"Mr FERGUSON (Reid) (1.16)-The absence of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) from this debate has unfortunately, from the Government's point of view, denied us the reality of seeing the two contradictory conspiracy theories that permeate the Liberal-Na- tional Party's industrial relations policy. The honourable member for Bennelong, being a bit more worldly, a bit more knowledgeable and realistic about indus- trial relations, comes forward with the theory that the relationship between the Government and the unions is one about subordination of wage demand; that the union movement has sat down and been pushed around by the Government in its interest. We have not had that particular line in this debate. We have had the other line which says that because an Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) docu- ment in 1987 advocated a smaller number of unions from its self interest, ipso facto it follows that the only reason the Gov-"

ernment is doing this today is because the ACTU wants it.
"Firstly, I would advise those opposite to look at a few more ACTU documents, look at a few more demands, to see how effective the ACTU has been in getting a lot of those other areas acted upon by the Government. I would hazard a gue~s that there has not been all that close a rela- tionship between ACTU demands and Government reaction."
"A number of speakers in this debate have cited a number of other sources be- sides the ACTU on' this issue. I am not talking about the Socialist Workers Party, the Communist Party of Australia or the trade union research officers. I wish to cite briefly 'some of those sources. There was the report by the Committee to Ad- vise on Policies for Manufacturing Indus- try in 1975, called the Jackson report. It was staffed by individuals who are held in some respect in this country. I quote from volume 1, page 111 of that report which stated:"
"Because unions are numerous, their membership fragmented, and their structure does not parallel industry structure, they may tend to be unaware of, or insensitive to, the impact of their actions on industries and firms."
The report later stated:
". . . the occupational structure of some unions, taken with fragmentation of membership, is a fertile field for demarcation and jurisdictional disputes."
"That is one body which is not beholden to the ACTU. It had some interest in the future of this country and' the future of its industry. It came down with a view which is very similar to what the Govern- ment is trying to do here today. I move to another inquiry that has been men- tioned, the report of the Hancock Com- mittee of Review of the Australian Industrial Relations 'L~w and Systems in 1975, which some members opposite would have heard of. It advocated, amongst other things, a simple majority in balance for amalgamation. If it could not achieve that, it put forward the prop- osition that the percentages required should be of those voting rather than those on the union membership rolls. Once"

"again, that is something this Government is trying to achieve here today."
"That inquiry, of course, has engendered a deal of respect from practitioners on both sides. It made a number of demands which the union movement would not be too happy with. As I say, this manoeuvre by the Government today supposedly is dictated only by ideological requirements. Unfortunately for the Opposition, the in- quiry seemed to come to a similar point of view about the need for trade union amalgamation in this country. At page 460 of volume 2 it stated:"
We do consider that there are too many associa- tions .. . . The scope of their membership coverage is often confusing and the reason for their coverage of particular industries or occupa- tions lost in history.
"It went on to say that the number of trade unions in this country was a relevant fac- tor in problems arising in the areas of demarcation, diffusion and extension of trade union resources and the solving of industrial disputes because of the multi- plicity of unions on particular sites."
"With. regard to the earlier reports, I would like to talk about the report of the Myers. Committee of Inquiry into Tech- nological Change in Australia. Once again, I would have thought that that inquiry was undertaken by people with some credibility; people with no particular loy- alties or need of partisanship. Quite incre- dibly, they seem to come down again on the side of this same need to do some- thing about trade union amalgamations in this country. The report, at page 173 of volume 1, stated:"
It would be highly desirable to achieve a reduc- tion in the number of unions in Australia through a process of amalgamations. Ideally this would result in union organisation arrangements that would be industry based. . . . provisions place significant barriers-
"that is, current provisions of the Act-"
in the way of amalgamations.
"It went on to advocate that the require- ment for registration, henceforth, at that stage-about a decade ago-should be 2,000 members and that those organisa- tions with 1,500 members should have to show cause why they should continue to be registered. It went on to make a com-"

parison. That comparison did not relate to the way-out fringe dweller philosophy of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) that what we are doing here today has some relationship with gulags and that it is the way down to collectiv- ism.
"The Myers report expressed that a closer equivalent, a better comparison, was with the West German situation. The report considered that we could learn something from West Germany's trade union move- ment. Whereas in Australia it said that it was not unusual to have 20 unions in every plant, in the West German situa- tion, which it thought was relevant in coming to its decision about the need to amalgamate in this country, there was rarely more than one union in a plant and there were only 18 in the whole country."
"What we have there is a series of in- quiries that were not dedicated to pushing political, ideological planks, but which were concerned with particular needs in this country-our industrial relations sys- tems, our manufacturing industry and technology. They all seemed to come to the conclusion that something urgent had to be done about the question of union numbers in this country and the question of amalgamations. They were not too in- terested in these quack theories about the ACTU dictating to the Government on the need to amalgamate because it was losing membership. They thought there was a fundamental need for the industry in this country to do something about it."
"I will quote from a more recent report. Once again, it is by a group about which I do not think the Opposition would be too critical. Quite frankly, I think that most of its prescriptions are things about which I would be more critical. But I do think this group has some credibility with the Opposition, and I refer to the Organ- isation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Economic Surveys 1989-90 for Australia. It cited a Business Council of Australia survey which la- mented the fact that the average firm in a sample taken was covered by four differ- ent awards, and that it had to negotiate with five different unions. It Cited the fact that 40 per cent had both State and Fed-"

4950 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

"eral awards in the same plant, and it also was somewhat concerned that 80 per cent had more than one union. But that OECD survey went on to make a few recommen- dations. It went on to give a bit of praise as to what should be done in this country. As I say, I am referring to the OECD- not to the Communist Party of Australia, the Australian Labor Party or any other groups on that particular side of the spec- trum. The OECD, at page 63 of that 198990 document, said:"
Change and innovation appears to be impeded by the complexity of unions and award structures themselves.
"At page 86, in a more concrete fashion, it made this comment:"
Union structures will have to be reformed. The ACTU's program to move towards a set of broad industry unions along with other recent ACTU initiatives designed to rationalise union coverage seems therefore highly desirable if it permits a significant. reduction in the number of unions in a single enterprise. Industry unions with affiliates at the firm level are likely to be in a better position to represent workers' interests.
So' there we have a series of suggestions by a variety of committees and overseas experts from 1975 onwards that there is some validity in the Australian Govern- ment's moves to do something about the number of unions in this country.
"I have said within my own Party that I have some lingering doubts about some aspects of this legislation. One of them, of course, has been corrected by the Aus- tralian Democrats' amendment, whereby the ability of union officials to keep their positions after a series of amalgamations has been reduced. I also have some con- cerns about the possibility of meetings deciding on certain amalgamations, but I note that there is a requirement that a deputy president has to permit that. Also, of more worry is the use of union facili- ties in favour of the Yes case in ballots, because there is often a very fine line between the official's self-interest in the political struggle within the union and the fact that he might see, through amalgam- ation, security for his future, both because of the extended time for which he will not face re-elections and because of per- haps the political nature of the union with which he.is amalgamating."

"But in regard to this crowd opposite, we witnessed last night the hypocrisy of the grandiloquent platitudes from the honourable member for Higgins about civil liberties and freedom. We also heard the Opposition's views today in regard to the freedom of people in nursing homes- the legislation of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), who is at the table. One has to question whether this whole concern with freedom is perhaps one-dimensional in so far as it relates to industrial relations and the need to suppress the trade union movement in a period of decline. We did not see too many of them, having regard to all of those magnificent speeches today and last night about freedom, liberty and individ- ual rights, cross the floor or profess to hold different views about that legislation."
"The honourable member for Higgins was the lead speaker on this matter. An- other aspect of the paranoid conspiracy theory concerned his comments about the Democrats. He made the comment that they roll over very quickly to Govern- ment demands, and that is the only rea- son that they could come to support this legislation. They could not be like all of these people who conducted government inquiries-without an ideological bent. They could not actually' see it as being a practical need in this country. It had to be some conspiracy, some deal."
"I would like to remind honourable members opposite that we considered leg- islation a few hours ago in regard to a data matching program. What happened in the upper House of this Parliament? The Democrats voted with the Liberals to amend that substantially. In the Senate today, Senator Spindler, on behalf of the Democrats, put forward amendments in regard to the Commonwealth Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. Once again, they did not seem to be too much inter- ested in the Government's dictates on these Bills. They seemed to be looking at what was required in the legislation from their point of view. . If we look at what has occurred in the last few weeks in the' Senate, we would find that the Australian Democrats have managed to either vote by themselves"

"against the Government or in unity with the Opposition on a variety of measures including-and I will not specify the whole lot because there are so many-the Commonwealth Bank restructuring, ex- port marketing development grants, taxa- tion laws amendments, the livestock legislation, migration regulations, et cet- era, ad nauseam. So for the Opposition to come in here today and say that the Dem- ocrats are simply supporting this legisla- tion because they have some kind of deal with the Government or they are easily able to be persuaded in these matters really does not stack up against the- real- ity. The Democrats have supported this for the same reason that this Government is putting it forward and for the same reason that a variety of fairly established and respected committees have come to the same conclusion."
"Amongst the more dubious claims of the honourable member for Higgins, of course, was that demarcations will not be reduced now. I am shocked that he could come before the House and put that view forward. Anyone with half a brain, any- one who has any experience of industrial relations in this country, knows that a crucial factor of demarcations is the num- ber of unions in each plimt. It was said that we are just creating bigger unions, when obviously the whole thrust of this legislation in the long term, rather than giving the ACTU control of the union movement, is to establish a variety of industrial unions. We want ,to move to- wards a situation where we do not have half a dozen unions battling over one bloke because of the nature of a job change last week."
The hOIl-ourab1e member cited figures to the effect that the latest trade union statistics show a preponderance of union membership in the Commonwealth and State public sectors. It was put forward that this is somehow another part of the giant conspiracy between Labor and the union movement.
"I notice that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), thought that the problem was not really in the public sector but in the man- ufacturing industry. I think that the level"

"of unionisation in the Public Service has a lot more to do with results reflected in some statistics put out by the Business Council of Australia. It came forward in October 1989 with a survey of unionisa- tion levels as per size of enterprise, which showed that in those enterprises with one to 10 people only 3.1 per cent had union- isation levels of over three-quarters of their employees, whereas for enterprises with 500 to 1,000 employees there was a pattern showing that more than half of the work force in those plants were union members."
"I think that the level of unionisation has a lot more to do with the nature of the enterprise, the fact that there is com- monality of employer and that there are in many cases fairly large concentrations of employees. It has been shown in a variety of industrial relations papers over- seas that that concentration of employees has something to do with unionisation levels rather than any conspiracy between this Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions."
"Brief mention was made of Inter- national Labour Organisation (lLO) con- ventions. All of a sudden, despite various employees running around like decapi- tated chooks about union demands and about the right to strike being respected because of ILO conventions, I have not heard the honourable member being too vocal on that issue. I think he might go along with employers in saying that we do not want those conventions to be re- cognised in Australia, but he selectively feels that the New Zealand trade union movement, apparently being taken to the ILO under convention No. 87 because it tried to prescribe 1,000 members per union, is a very good precedent for Aus- tralia."
"If we look at the facts of life, we. see that the New Zealand union movement is one-fifth the size of the Australian trade union movement. If we look at the nature of its industry, it would be fair to say that the concentration of employees in plants in New Zealand is far less than here. In fairly spread out industries of very small numbers in New Zealand, it might be quite unfair to require a minimum of"

4952 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

Industrial Relations Bill

"1,000 members. Also, as we know, New Zealand has a tradition of independent labour councils in major towns. For many years they have not moved towards nationalisation. So there are a few differ- ences there."
"Turning briefly to a few specific meas- ures in the Bill, I an particularly pleased with changes in regard to preference clauses. The honourable member for Higgins talked about the fact that people get sacked because they will not go along with unions, et cetera. I have actually had the real life experience of being involved in unionisation drives. I cite the example of Impact Plastics, which coincidentally is now in my electorate. The 25 or 30 people from that company who joined the union coincidentally were the same people whose jobs the employer attempted to terminate, supposedly because of a downturn in in- dustry. He just happened to pick the people who first joined the union."
It was only through the use of prefer- ence clauses-in that case under State awards because the Federal preference clauses had traditionally not been as strong as those of the State-that we were able to secure the right of those people to ac- tually join a trade union and to get the conciliation commissioners in New South Wales to put people back in their jobs.
"The preference clause in this Act will specify the areas of preference, whether they involve engagements, transfers, vo- cational training, et cetera, but it will also, as in the specific example I gave the House, protect people who have applied for membership of trade unions and who have not been accepted by those organi- sations. It will protect them and their right not to be dismissed, particularly in the case of unionisation drives."
"Other measures in the Bill relate to fed- erations of unions in the lead-up to amal- gamations. I note in New South Wales the very effective moves for such a feder- ation of unions covering commercial trav- ellers, storemen and packers, pastry cooks, millers and a number of others in the food industry. That obviously represents a viable way of operating in the interim"

period before amalgamation can be ac- complished.
"Finally, this legislation has the intent of endeavouring to encourage amalgama- tions and to end protracted processes, such as negotiations, ballots, et cetera, which result in amalgamations taking up to two years to complete, no matter how much they are favoured amongst people."
"In an all round sense, this legislation represents a requirement for Australian industry to put the union movement more on the basis of industrial strands. It is a move in a direction that has been favoured by a variety of government investigations under different political parties."
"I am not going to dwell at length on SPCLtd. It has been covered over and over again by everyone. I only want to refer to one point on democracy. I for one was very concerned that the full time employees iri this plant felt that it was very democratic for them to have the right to giveaway the conditions of the sea- sonal workers, who had no vote whatso- ever in that decision. What is democratic about that? People- were given no say whatsoever in the vote arid their condi- tions were just thrown out the door. I question the timing, of the decision. It might be possible that the timing of this matter had a lot more to do with the onset of the period of work for- seasonal workers than with the incompetent mis- management of the previous directors."
"Mr FILING (Moore) (1.36)-1 com- mence my remarks on the Industrial Re- lations Legislation Amendment Bill by mentioning a few words that were ex- pressed by a visitor to Australia in the 1950s, a very astute observer of the Aus- tralian social system of the time, John Pringle. In Australian Accent he said:"
"The easy-going nature of the Austra- lian . . . has not protected him from the en- croachment of modern bureaucracy to impose on him more easily. And the leaders appointed by the proletariat to administer the law have proved, in the trade unions, some of. the most arbitrary and tyrannical rulers in the democratic world."
"I mention those words because at this time in the world's history, when the di- rection of the world is towards smaller units and towards fragmentation-not"

"amalgamation, not centralisation of pow- ers-we have before us a Bill that would effectively centralise and amalgamate one of the important institutions in Australian society."
"The Bill that we are debating today has substantial ramifications for the ailing economy of Australia. I challenge the Government, to reassess the need for its implementation. The Government claims that fewer trade unions will promote stronger and more efficient unions and will strengthen the industrial relations process."
"The amended Bill aims to increase the qualifying membership threshold for unions from 1,000 members to 10,000 members. The Bill also recognises federa- tions of unions before amalgamation, ex- empts union members from secret postal ballots and will be responsible for em- ployment preferences extended to mem- bers of a trade union at the discretion of the Australian-Industrial Relations Com- mission. The rationale for this Bill is in contrast to the Government's claim to be committed to structural economic reform and illustrates the Government's shallow support for micro-economic reform and deregulation of industries in Australia to effect competitive solutions to our eco- nomic crisis."
"Increased competition is allegedly being implemented in the telecommunications industry by the Labor Government and yet here the Government has introduced a Bill which will decrease competition. This legislation ~e~ks to tighten the anti- competitive monopolistic stranglehold of unions in the name of greater efficiency. It is a well-known fact that the size of an organisation ,itself is not a determinant of efficiency. The current trend in many public and private s~ctor organisations to smaller business units is a clear reversal of the preyious-trend to larger centralised structures."
"The point I am making is that the cir- cumstances that facilitate economies of scale will not apply' themselves in the case of the trade union movement. Economies of scale occur in activities where, as out- put of a uniform standard increases, a"

"decline in average costs results. In this situation big may be better. However, this clearly does not apply in the case of trade unions. Trade union actiyity involves very specific and often unique problems of members. The issues are often sponta- neous and of a reactive nature and there- fore are far from being constant and repetitive, as is the case with those other notions of economies of scale."
"The alternative approach to economies of scale is the approach to minimise costs by control of cost creators. It is this ap- proach that applies itself better to trade union activity. For this to work, smaller, not bigger, organisations must be encour- aged. Big institutions are unresponsive to individual needs and requirements and concentrate power in the hands of a few. Amalgamation of unions into mega-unions will not lessen demarcation disputes."
"At present there are approximately 300 registered trade unions. The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill seeks to reduce this to 20 mega-unions, a decrease of over 90 per cent. Employee participation and decentralisation of or- ganisational power at all levels are the best way of achieving and maintaining productive results in the labour market. This country desperately needs coopera- tion and communication between employ- ers and employees to encourage productivity and competitiveness. We must move away from centralised wage fixing and concentrate more on negotia- tions in the workplace. This, together with equitable enterprise bargaining structures to determine wages conditions will satisfy the unique situations that occur in the Australian labour marketplace. Industries exposed to strong competition cannot sur- vive with the basic structural rigidities that make for inefficiency. At present, groups of employers negotiate with unions and have award provisions provided across the board, ensuring a general wage increase being transmitted across all companies."
"However, Australia does need unions. I personally have been a member of several unions, including the Food Preservers Union of Victoria, which is involved in the SPC Ltd dispute. We require enter-"

4954 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

"prise-based unions, however, which ad- dress the working conditions and particular needs of their members and do not waste resources on factional battles and power-broking. Unions must partici- pate in the search for productivity gains that benefit the employee, the employer and ultimately the country itself."
"A more effective industrial relations framework, based on voluntary enter- prise-based agreements, which reflects in- centive and resourcefu.1ness is required if we are ever to have a hope of solving our economic problems. The introduction of this Bill undermines this objective. Ordi- nary workers would pe deprived of the right of self-determination and the right to work harder for themselves and for the betterment of their families."
"A classic example of self-perpetuating myopia has been mentioned several times in this debate: the SPC dispute. People at the Shepparton-based canning company sought to negotiate pay cuts rather than shut down the cannery and prevent the possible destruction of the local fruit growing industry. Some 93 per cent of the employees agreed with the proposal to forgo benefits in return for a profit share when the company was back on' its feet. Cooperation was then sought from the ACTU and Victorian Trades Hall Council so that the SPC jobs and factory may be saved. SPC sales last year exceeded $155m. The compapy injects about $40m into the local economy every year and, according to company sources, this has a multiplication factor of seven. SPCem- ploys 300 permanent staff and another 1,000 seasonal workers during January and April."
"The only way that the company can stay afloat is to save $2.5m through em- ployee wage cut-backs, an arrangement that was supported by the employees of this company. Representing the voice of Trades Hall, Mr John Halfpenny declared that the deal was not on. Wage restraint supposedly makes companies profitable enough to create new jobs. The logic of the SPC agreement was that restraint would save jobs now and bring a share of future profit. The management and work- ers of SPC would agree that the last thing"

they need is a union hierarchy protecting power over jobs.

"Much of the plight of SPC is shared by other export businesses and isa result of the value of the dollar, interest rates, cheap imports at home and protected markets abroad. Some 16,030 businesses and companies were declared bankrupt in the year ending June 1990. The latest figures for small business and personal bankruptcies for the September quarter show a 32.7 increase across Australia, with particular States with basket-case econ- omies, such as Victoria and Western Aus- tralia, showing 70.6 per cent and 55.1 per cent respectively and showing the greatest increases."

to protect the interests of the workers

through enterprise-based awards. No ef-

unionism acted in the interests of the

if wage increases are not supported by the

increases the cost of a' major input for

firms regardless of their capacity to pay.

"Rapid change is inherent in today's economies and, in order to survive, the Australian economy must be flexible enough to cope with the changes if our standard of living. is to be. maintained. With the ACTU and the Federal Govern- merit supporting the central wage-fixing system, the scope for wage signals to ini- tiate labour to move to productive areas of the economy is limited. As a result, productivity growth ih the Australian economy has occurred at a much slower rate in the 1980s than in previous dec- ades. Yet the very institution that was put in place to protect the needs of the work- ers is now a threat to workers' constitu- tional rights. Clause 11 of the Bill has serious implications for .workers who choose to cease to be union members. The provisions of this Bill would imply that someone can determine whether a worker loses the right to keep a job. This decision is one that should be based solely on ability and should not depend on membership of a union."
"The Bill proposes that between March 1992 and February 1993 organisations with a membership of less than 1,000 will be compelled to justify their' continued existence. From March 1994 to February 1995 organisations of employees with fewer than 10,000 members will be 'forced to justify their continued existence. These actions are supposedly in the public inter- est."
"This Bill will, in effect, take away the right of a worker to choose which organi- sation he or she will belong to and decide on how, when and where he or she should work. This is a violation of civil liberty, and as a result of this Bill Australians will lose the right to democracy in the work- place because they will not be allowed to take part in smaller unions, unions that are more likely to represent specific inter- ests of the community and are necessary to ensure that proper representation is provided, for workers in the workplace of small companies and industries. This ob- viously discourages the formulation of small enterprise-based unions,unions which can most effectively negotiate with their employer for. better pay and condi- tions in return for greater productivity."

"The Bill will force workers to join unions because of legislation and not be- cause of the merits of union membership or because of the service or benefits that they may be entitled to by belonging to a trade union. It seems this compulsion is necessitated by the fact that the negative aspects of trade unionism these days are deterring people from joining unions. This Bill will enhance the negative aspects of unionism, which include concentration and centralisation of power to the few, the violation of the rights of individuals and the reinforcement of undemocratic procedures. The Government has called for an alteration to the secret ballot. A Liberal-National Party Government initi- ated the secret postal ballot and as such it is a true democratic institution within the industrial work force."
"The Government has been unable to instigate union amalgamation under this system and, by seeking alterations to this procedure, is again undermining the de- mocratisation of the union movement. In 1989 Senator Button agreed that the more flexibility that could be introduced into the wages system and the more industry and enterprise level negotiation on wages that could be held, the better the system would be. Surely union amalgamation is not consistent with this objective. How can the Government move towards bigger unions with a membership of 10,000 and still cater for decentralised bargaining on enterprise agreements. The strengthening of bureaucratic forces in Australian indus- trial relations will retard the development of enterprise-based and productive ar- rangements. Amalgamation should not be confused with efficiency or better indus- trial relations, but is simply an avenue to greater concentration of power within the unions."
"The statistics show that between 1976 and 1988 trade union membership of Australian employees fell from 51 per cent to 42 per cent. Unionisation fell from 39 per cent to 32 per cent in the private sector between 1982 and 1988, and from 73 per cent to 68 per cent in the public sector. Only 32 per cent of all private sector employees currently belong to a union, and the remaining 68 per cent are"

4956 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

Industrial Relations Bill

"able to negotiate with their employers without the need for outside interference. In the nearly half million new private sector jobs created between 1986 and 1988, unions recruited only 7 per cent of the new employees. Nearly 90 per cent of new jobs are being created in private sec- tor employment areas, the rate of unioni- sation in these areas being less than 26 per cent."
"The proposed amalgamation of unions is a desperate measure to restore union based power. The force to implement this ratification is not coming from the work- ers of Australia but from the union offi- cials who are supposedly acting on their behalf. We have a situation where the movement created on behalf of the work- ers is now only interested in self-preser- vation and self-perpetuation and has lost sight of its original objectives. Why should there be a need for amalgamation legisla- tion if the workers' interests are being truly represented now? There is nothing to stop union amalgamation occurring at present. A mega-union is-more likely to experience irresponsible conduct andmis.:. management, and it is easier for this to go unnoticed in such a large organisation. The average member has far less contact with office bearers and less efficient rep- resentationby the union on his or her behalf in the workplace. The factor of size and accountability would cause a mega- union to neglect its real duties to its mem- bers in preference to spending time and money for fighting internal factional and political frictions."
"Senator Harradine in the Senate said that this Bill will force some 632,000 workers, or 18.6 per cent of the total membership, out of their unions and into another union-a larger union whiCh will almost certainly understand the needs of those new-members less than the smaller enterprise based unions did. This action disregards the rights of workers .and is a direct contravention of convention No: 87 of the International Labour Or- ganisation. The Bill abuses workers' rights to freedom of association under this con. vention. To force union members out of their unions into other unions is a denial of workers' rights."

"Employers and employees should be free to make their own agreements on employ- ment conditions and wages. The net result of amalgamation will increase the poten- tial for unions organised largely on polit- ical lines and the potential for large scale disputes based on political rather than industrial objectives. The proposition that unions in order to survive have to be big is a myth. Unions in Britain, for example, are' losing members as a result of' a com- bination of public policy, the economic climate and the outdated philosophies of union leaders. Their demise cannot be correlated to their size and number."

Amalgamations would. extend across the

broad spectrum of Australian industry and

would facilitate greater industry turmoil

than exists at present. With 20 mega-

power than any other labour movement

"regime. It is on this basis, and in view of the serious economic situation of this country, that I strongly support the Bill's rejection, and I appeal to the Government to do likewise."
"Mr McARTHUR (Corangamite) (1.55)-The watershed for Australian trade unionism could well be 1990 as a result of the Industrial Relations Amend- ment Bill being enacted in this Parliament in December of this year. In 1991, 100 years of the existence of the Australian Labor Party will be celebrated. The Min- ister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) will issue a stamp on this occasion to mark that particular event. A Minister drew that to the attention of the House yesterday. I suggest that in a few years time we may be issuing the Bill Kelty' memorial stamp to mark the de- mise of the Australian trade union move- ment. This last gasp for union power is taking place today in this Parliament, as the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) proposes to amalgamate the unions in bigger groups to save the trade union movement. In effect, this Bill will ensure that no new unions will be formed because of the restraint to create smaller groups."
"As honourable members on this side of the House have said and honourable members on that side of the House have agreed, trade union membership is in de- cline. The figures, which are quite stagger- ing, show that in 1983 when the Hawke Government was elected-and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is an ex-President of the ACTU-49 per cent of the work force were in trade unions. By 1990, 40 per cent were unionised-a remarkable decline of nearly 9.5 per cent."
"The fundamental problems of main- taining membership are apparent, and honourable members opposite have made that clear and understand the problem. We now have the proposition why any individual would join a trade union of 20,000 members or more. We have also heard that in the public sector 62 per cent of the work force is unionised. We have the situation where job promotion de- pends upon members in the public sector having a union ticket. If one is a teacher"

"in Victoria one cannot even get promo- tion unless one has a union ticket. It is made very clear that unless one has a ticket one's promotional chances are less- ened. Of course, there is considerable in- fluence by this Government and other Labor governments around Australia to make sure that public sector utilities have full union membership. Of course, they have a compliant work force which will do their bidding in maintaining this com- paratively high union membership."
"In the private sector, as honourable members on this side of the House have said, about 31 per cent of the work force are now in unions. Small companies are not interested in having union members on their sites and people in small shops are not keen on joining unions because they are getting a good deal from the management. If we look at the figures in the finance and retail sectors, we see that there are hardly any union activities in these arenas. So as management im- proves, as we see it improving around Australia, the need for unions becomes less and less."
"I was in Geelong last week looking at some of the smaller manufacturing oper- ations which are suffering under the so- called recession that we needed to have. The Ford Motor Company is in some difficulty because of its sales and restruc- turing program. I visited three smaller companies that supply the Ford Motor Company with component parts. The in- teresting thing to emerge from that visit was the concern by these companies to provide quality products that meet world standards. More importantly, the work force operating in these smaller compa- nies was monitoring its own quality standards-a far cry from only five to 10 years ago. There was an awareness by both the management and the work force of the importance of export markets and the companies' need to maintain an ex- port perspective so that the companies can remain profitable."
"The other interesting thing amongst these smaller operations was the concern of management and shop stewards for workers' conditions. There are problems of work stations, repetition strain injury"

4958 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

Industrial Relations Bill

"and changing workers around the various tasks, and an awareness by both the unions and the management that everyone will be better off if there is quality perform- ance and the workers are happy in the job."
"In the Geelong era there was great con- cern; workers wished to keep their jobs. In this recession which has been brought about by the policies of the present Gov- ernment, workers are very concerned-as they now are at SPC Ltd and' other places around Australia-to keep their jobs and improve their performance, because they know that it is pretty tough out there. They know that they have to change their work performance, produce a quality ar- ticle and change their work practices to meet the challenges of the next decade."
"Management has- certainly made a big change in its approach to a number of the problems in the work force. As one senior manager said to me, jf management was good, unions would not be needed on the shop floor because most of the problems could be sorted out by mutual discussion."
"We now have the classic example of the pre~ent Government's attitude towards centralising power in Canberra or at some central point. This legislation clearly cen- tralises trade union power, reducing 300 unions to 20 unions. There is coercive pressure by legislation and by the Govern- ment on the union movement-its friends-to push it into so-called 20 mega- unions from the 300-odd smaller, group- ings. That means that the .Government and some of these mega-unions can put considerable pressure on big companies and public sector utilities, as we have found in the various strikes around the States. It would only take a phone call from Mr Kelty to the Prime Minister of the day indicating the trade unions'posi- tion. It is much easier to organise indus- trial disruption if one has only 20 mega- unions to confront government or the big- ger companies."
"We see a similar situation in the ter- tiary education sector. My colleague the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the shadow Minister for educa- tion, is seeing this very same process hap-"

"pening. There were 65 institutions doing a good job, providing good educational services to their students, but the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) said that we must have about 35 institutions. He wants to consol- idate, ceptralise and make them bigger, with no rational debate as to why there would be any greater efficiencies in terms of the delivery of educational s.ervices by having these 35 big institutions on the Australian education scene. This has been brought about, of course, by pressure on capital and recurrent funding. The Gov- ernment has said, 'Unless you amalga- mate, associate and get bigger, we will cut back your funds'. It now has control of the funding and the curriculum, so that in Canberra we again have these central- ised, controlled arrangements which are very much the thrust of the current Bill before the House."

There was a proposition by the Victo-

rian Government to amalgamate all local

"councils. After a very big fight, that prop-"

osition was turned over because local

councils did not want to amalgamate; they

wanted to run their own shows. If they

see the advantages of making local amal-

"gamations and do so voluntarily, we on"

"this side are happy about that, just as we"

are about trade unions making their own

arrangements among themselves. We are

completely opposed to this coercive prop-

osition that is before the Parliament where

unions and union members are being

forced to amalgamate under very strin-

gent guidelines.

'

"The main purpose of the Bill is to re- duce the number of trade unions, as I have said, in the Australian workplace by a process of amalgamation between unions. This wille be achieved by raising the membership threshold for registration of a trade union from 1,000 to 20,000. That has at least been reduced to 10,000 due to the Senate amendments. I was pleased that the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) conceded the point that 10,000 was a more manageable num- ber than 20,000, making the amalgama- tion procedures less stringent, recognising and enhancing the role of peak councils or federations of unions prior to amal-"

"gamation, and reinforcing and extending the preferences which the Australian In- dustrial Relations Commission may ex- tend to members of a trade union."
"The Bill has its genesis in a paper pre- pared by the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Bill Kelty, in May 1987 entitled Future Strategies for the Trade Union Movement and adopted by the ACTU Congress in September 1987. The rationale for the report was that the trade union move- ment was in decline and that steps had to be taken to reverse the process. According to the report, a reorganisation of and re- duction in the number of unions from approximately 325 to about 20 was there- fore necessary for the better servicing of members~ interests and would be-and I quote:"
. .. more conducive to the development and maintenance of effective industrial relations proc- esses.
Those are interesting words. What they really mean is that we must maintain the power of trade union leaders in the ACTU before all the. grassroots membership leaves the trade union movement alto- gether.
"It should be realised that Mr Kelty's rationale for the amalgamation proposal has been challenged by several eminent trade unionists, including two recent ad- visers to Mr Michael Easson, Secretary of the Labour Council of New South Wales. They claimed that size was no guarantee of organisational efficiency and that union conglomerates controlled by left wing mil- itants would not be in the interests of members or the movement generally. That is a very clear indication from inside the trade union movement on what it thinks about these mega-unions."
"Nevertheless, amalgamation remains ACTU policy. It is the coalition's belief that the Bill is not designed to achieve any fundamental reform of our industrial relations system; rather, it is to enhance the power of the ACTU and its affiliates. The Bill in its original form provided for an overall minimum membership Qf a trade union of 20,000 members. The Government has since accepted the amendment by the Australian Democrats"

"to reduce it to 10,000, as I have men- tioned. Unions will still be required to reach this figure by 1 March 1993 or face deregistration-again, a very clear indi- cation, as members on this side have said, that this is a coercive piece of legislation which forces unions into a position that they might not desire."
"Even if one could sign up 10,000 to 20,000 members it would still be impos- sible to obtain registration as a union, should there be a union to which mem- bers could conveniently belong-that wonderful phrase that is so often used by the arbitration commission and the union movement. This requirement has existed since March 1989. The effect of this sta- tutory provision has been to keep new entrants out of the market. The require- ment that new entrants have to have 10,000 to 20,000 members before apply- ing for registration merely consolidates existing barriers. We have the classic sit- uation of a closed shop for unions creat- ing new groups within the work force. As I mentioned earlier, that will be the death knell of the trade union movement in future years."
"Unions which decline to amalgamate or which fail to convince enough of their members of the perceived benefits of amalgamation, so that the figure of 10,000 by 1 March 1993 is not reached, will have to convince the Commission that special circumstances exist which necessitate their continuation; they have to prove that they will stay around as a trade union, even though they have been around for 20, 30, 40 or 50 years, because they just have not got enough numbers. The Commission, in such circumstances, would allow a tem- porary exemption that would be reviewed every three years. If the Commission is not satisfied that special circumstances exist, then it must cancel the registration of the union. Thus, any small union granted an exemption. would have to jus- tify its right to exist every three years. What a wonderful democratic right that is for trade unions around Austnilia-to have to go to the. Commission and dem- onstrate why they should have the right to exist!"

4960 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

Industrial Relations Bill

"Given the fact that the Government and the ACTU clearly believe that unions with fewer than 20,000 or 10,000 mem- bers may not be in the public interest, it is doubtful that many, if any, will survive for very much longer. In effect, the Bill therefore actively prevents the formation of new enterprise-based unions and reaf- firms and cements the notion of craft unions and industry awards. A number of speakers on this side of the House have made a very strong point about this- that the Bill runs counter to the current thinking in industrial relations, even by the Commission, that we need enterprise- based unions, not mega:-unions, which this Bill puts forward so clearly. Not only does it fly in the face of the union movement's much vaunted commitment to meaning- ful restructuring and greater flexibility, but it blatantly reinforces the notion of rela- tivities between awards and the central- ised nature of the present system. The theory undoubtedly is to preserve the old system of comparative wage justice under the guise of reform."
"The Bill provides us with a major op- portunity to improve the institutional ar- rangements which have been for so long at the epicentre of industrial relations in this country. If Australia is to become more competitive in world markets and if its products are to become the best in the world, then we must be able to match the best work methods in the world. Most of our competitors work with one bargaining unit or union per workplace. The average number of unions in Australian work- places is five, rising to 11 or more in large enterprises, completely killing the myth that has been put- forward by speakers opposite that these large unions will re- duce the number of unions in individual workplaces."
"Despite persistent- arguments of the Business Council of Australia, detailed in a comprehensive study 'Enterprise-Based Bargaining Units: A Better Way of Work- ing', that the most pressing reform re- quired is the reduction of the number of unions per work place, the amalgamation proposals contained in this Bill fail to address this problem. At best the amal- gamation proposals would reduce the"

"number of unions represented in many Business Council member companies from 12 to about 10. The potential benefits for employers from amalgamation, that is, the ease and clarity of negotiating with fewer unions and the reduction of demarcation disputes, are hence totally illusory."
"Indeed, it is quite clear that in its pres- ent form the Bill will not achieve the stated objective of reducing demarcation disputes. All it does is set the scene for the emergence of large craft-based con- glomerate unions wielding excessive power and covering thousands of workers in a wide range of different industries. It does little, if anything, to increase the enter- prise focus of bargaining in the work place."
"It should be noted at this point that the proposed amendments in section 18 will increase the influence of the ACTU on the Commission's deliberation of the de- marcation disputes arising from union claims of coverage of workers by, firstly, increasing the onus on the Commission to consult with the ACTU and, secondly, by obliging the Commission to consider not only the agreements but the undertak- ings as well. The practical effect of this is that the proposed change will allow the ACTU to put a point of view as to the undertaking in camera with no opportu- nity for other parties to challenge it."
Both the Government and the ACTU are well aware that amalgamation propos- als contained in the Bill are based more on the need to secure the future of the union movement as we approach the twenty-first century than on- any real at- tempt at constructive change to the way we do things.
"Declining membership and rank and file dissatisfaction with the overtly political nature of the ACTU and its ruling' elite are symptomatic of the vigour with which Mr Kelty has pursued the amalgamation agenda; Trade unionists themselves, Lau- rie Short and Joe Thompson in particular, have argued strenuously that far from bringing industrial harmony and stability to our industries, the creation of super unions will, with little doubt, worsen the position and lead to bigger industrial dis- putes. Joe Thompson has given an exam-"

pIe of the possible amalgamation of the

Storemen and Packers Union and the

Transport Workers Union about which he

said: .

.

"This super union would have an interest in al- most every enterprise in the nation and could bring Australia to its knees, with little more than a telephone call."
"Laurie Short, former national secretary of the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia, has pointed out that bigger unions will simply mean more power in the hands of union bureaucrats. It cer- tainly does not imply more rational or responsible union leadership nor an in- creased say for workers in their day-to- day activities."

"Let me say quite clearly that there is no empirical evidence to suggest that fewer, larger unions will make the trade union movement more efficient or responsible to good industrial relations. We can all imagine what would have been the case had the much celebrated Secretary of the Builders Labourers Federation, Mr Norm Gallagher, obtained control of a super union comprising 200,000 to 300,000 members across the spectrum of the building industry. Imagine what that would have meant!"

"It should not be forgotten that the wage break-out in 1981-82 did not burst forth from clear skies. It had its own, avoida- ble, origin 10 years earlier with the amal- gamation of the three communist controlled metal trades unions-engi- neers, boilermakers, and sheet metal workers-into what we now know as the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union. It was the fatal mistake of the Government and the metal trades employers who in 1971 failed to recognise the danger signals of the proposed amalgamation which led to .the massive wage-hours escalation in 1981-82, a mistake which did more to weaken the Australian manufacturing in- dustry than any other single cause in re- cent times."

"In view of the time, I conclude on that and say that the Opposition is totally op- posed to the Bill. We put some vigorous points of view on this side. It stands fun- damentally in contradiction to our well known industrial relations policy which"

"provides for enterprise agreements, a more flexible approach and a dramatic change to the way in which we should run Aus- tralia's future industrial relations arrange- ments over the next decade under the new Hewson Government. We totally reject the Bill, we totally reject the concepts and we totally reject the domination of the ACTU which is instituted in the Bill by way of legislation."

That consideration of the message be made an order of the day for the next sitting.
SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT Mr HAWKE (Wills-Prime Minister) (2.28)-1 move:
"That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday, 12 February 1991, at 2 p.m., unless otherwise called together by Mr Speaker or, in the event of Mr Speaker being unavailable; by the Chairman of Committees."
"Of course, we trust that that will not be the case, Mr Speaker. We have had a very eventful year. An election has been won and lost and, because of this, the Parlia- ment did hot meet until May. This nec- essarily shortened autumn sitting was followed, 1 point out-to those who feel that we have not been here long enough, by a quite normal Budget sitting period. Next autumn sitting pattern will also meet the norm. With all the Christmas spirit it is possible to muster in these hardened economic times, 1 put on the record that this Government has not at any time at- tempted to reduce for political ends the number of sitting days available to this House. 1 hope that, again with the genu- ine spirit of the season, the Opposition will recognise that it can do none of us any good in the long run to perpetuate the myth that the sitting program has been manipulated."
"Mr Carlton-What rubbish! Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honour- able member for Mackellar might actually catch the early plane. Mr HAWKE- People are cynical about parliantentarians-and with good cause in some ihstances. We do not need to add unjustly to that burden. 1 am glad to say that all of us will be back here next February, keen as always to serve the na- tion. 1 am probably more glad that there are no retirements or impending absences on this side of the House than 1 am about the lack of them on the other. But 1 cer- tainly hope that my friends on both sides of the House and everywhere have both a safe and a happy Christmas. 1 would also like to extend the season's greetings to all those who help make the Parliament such an effective working en- vironment. The Clerk, the Deputy Clerk,"

"the Clerk Assi~tants and our relatively new Serjeant-at-Arms have, as usual, ensured that the business of this place has been completed smoothly and professionally and that the intricacies of parliamentary procedure do not but momentarily delay even the least polished of our parliamen- tary performers. The Joiht House Depart- ment, the attendants, the transport office-the latter being much in demand today, 1 should think-all do a truly re- markable job, and we thank them for it."
"Mr Speaker, in the true spirit of Christ- mas, at a time of the year when we should forgive those who have so cruelly wronged us, 1 also make mention of the stirling work of the Hansard staff and the tele- phone technicians. They labour under im- mense strains, 1 know. They do excellent work with a consistency which makes an error all the more surprising. All 1 can say; Mr Speaker, is why me? Why is it my phone? Why is it my words of eloqu- ence, so carefully chosen, so effectively delivered, that are the exceptions which prove the rule? 1 particularly mention Mrs Jocelyn Green, senior editor with Hansard, who, 1 am informed, is retiring in Febru- ary after 18 years service. 1 say to her and to all in Hansard: thank you for a year's work well done."
"Honourable members- Hear, hear! Mr HAWKE-I also want to make mention ofthe switchboard operators, who have such a thankless job handling the truly phenomenal number of calls which this place attracts. Marlene, the supervi- sor, Beryl, .who has recently retired, Barbara, Dalroy, Pam, Margaret and Tracy do a great job. Merry Christmas, ladies, and thank you very much. . Honourable members-Hear, hear! Mr HAWKE-To the Whip, George Gear, and his Deputy, Ted Grace, go my thanks for the task of keeping up the numbers. 1 know their life is made easier by the able support provided by Catherine Mundy. The Parliamentary Liaison Offi- cer, Clare Nairn, and her helpers, also do a tremendous job and deserve their Christmas break. We thank them very sincerely indeed. On the other side of the House, 1 am told that Rita Phillips, who"

"has serviced the coalition parties loyally since 1964, has just retired. I did not know Rita, but such service is indeed rare. It deserves mention and sincere thanks at this time, and they are so extended."
"I would also like to mention at this time my hard-working ~nd popular Leader of the House, Kim Beazley. He has so many favourable characteristics. He is a model of sartorial elegance. Kim and his able Opposition counterpart could do, I am sure, with the rest that Christmas brings. Their task-yours on this side, Kim, and yours on that side, Wale-is truly an onerous one. I appreciate, as I think all members do, the nature of the relationship between you. It is an honour- able one of integrity and it helps the func- tioning of this place. I thank you both very much indeed."
"Mr Speaker, may I wish you, too, a merry Christmas. The speakership and the positions of responsibility occupied by you, your deputies and the committee chairmen require that political judgment be put aside in favour of a, responsibility to this Parliament. I believe-and I think I speak for all members of this Rouse, Mr Speaker, in respect of you and your col- leagues-that this very difficult and deli- cate duty is done well and deserves our recognition. I hope that you will take from me, 'to yourself personally and to your colleagues, our sincere thanks for a job very well done. , Indeed, Mr Speaker, all member~ of this place and their families endure a great burden which public office demands of them. We chose to be here and to accept those burdens but, for the families of members, in so many cases I think that lot is an even more difficult one than it is for members. I think the enormous bur- den that falls upon the families of mem- bers of this place is truly not sufficiently often and well recognised."
"In closing, I would like most sincerely to extend to members in all parts of this place my personal wishes for a joyous Christnias with their loved ones and dear ones and the hopes for a happy new year. I also hope that each one of you will take to your families my best wishes and thanks"

for their sustenance to you through what

has been a difficult year.

"Dr HEWSON (Wentworth-Leader of the Opposition) (2.36)-1 am delighted to join the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in extending my best wishes for the Christ- mas season and for a holiday break, which many of us undoubtedly really need. The Prime Minister said it was a busy year and an unusual year, and that it was. I have lasting memories of television im- ages of the faces of a couple of people on election eve-the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), who did not expect to be here, and the present Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), who apparently also did not expect to be here. As it was, ,you managed to get a handful of votes more than we did and come back in government. In saying that, I would like to record the recognition of our side of the House for the fantastic job that Andrew Peacock did as Leader of the co- alition. More Australians voted for Andrew Peacock as Prime Minister than voted for you, Sir, and I think that is a very important point to go down in the history of this place. Congratulations, An- drew, on a fantastic job."

"I also note with some interest, and in- deed delight, the comments you, Prime Minister, made about parliamentary standards. It was an issue that I did raise as the subject of my first address in this Parliament as Leader. It is an issue we firmly believe in, and we have taken some steps, tentative though they be, towards raising the standards of Parliament. To my mind, one of the clearest mes~ages of the last election was that there was some- thing of a pla.gue on both our Houses, and it is our responsibility to remove that by raising the standard of our performance."

"I note that you claim that there was no political manipulation of the number of sitting days, but I also note that you had some trouble saying that with a straight face. I take it on face value, that you were very genuine in what you said. If you are genuine, I look forward to your response to our request to televise the proceedings of this House.

"I finish with two other comments. First, I have a genuine concern for those in Australia who will have a black Christmas this year because of the state of our econ- omy. It is a situation that could have been avoided.

They have particular impor- tance at critical times, for example, in relation to the Middle East, the Uruguay Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and so forth, all of which are adding an additional insurance and dimension to the relations between Aus- tralia and a number of countries, and I commend that that work might continue."

I join with the Leader of the Opposi-

particularly the role of the Australian As-

political process and I salute particularly the work that they carry out.
"Undeniably, in 1990 the high point of the year for me was the excellent Gallipoli pilgrimage; the organisation and carriage of it, involving the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), and many others, and more particularly,the 57 World War I veterans who went back to Gallipoli on the occasion of the sev- enty-fifth anniversary of Anzac. I salute all who were involved in that ,pilgrimage."
"The low point of the year, undeniably, has to be the unfolding economic agony for so many across Australia, particularly provincial Australia. That has been dis- cussed in detail on other occasions in the House and will continue to be discussed in more detail, I warn, on the resumption of the Parliament on 12 February, given the savage, continuing economic down- turn, especially in provincial Australia."
"Finally, I extend Christmas greetings to those in the Gulf and to those who have just returned and their families. I point out that the Navy has three ships there now, HMAS Sydney, HMAS Brisbane and HMAS Success. There is also the medical team on the USNS Comfort; various ele- ments of the Air Force and the Army are also there, including those on exchange postings. On behalf of all honourable members, if all goes to plan, I hope to be with those personnel in the Gulf on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day to ex- tend greetings to them because they are carrying out- the wishes of the Govern- ment, of the Parliament. They are doing it in the best professional tradition of the Australian diggers and we certainly wish them well at this time., To all a happy Christmas. There is a difficult economic time ahead in 1991. Clearly it is a case of battening down the hatches in 1991 and I wish everyone well."
Mr BEAZLEY (Swan-Leader of the House) (2.49)-1 must' start by wishing Tim a happy Christmas. None of his col- leagues will have an opportunity to do that .in person on Christmas Day unless they boost the profit levels of the GTC Ltd. It is getting a bit hard for the Gov-

ernment to organise sufficient overseas military commitments to provide the Leader of the National Party with an an- nual opportunity to partake of Christmas in foreign climes but we will do our best.
"Everybody who should be thanked has been thanked, so from this point on I think the thanks that are handed out are increasingly personal. In the circumstan- ces in which we now find ourselves I can- not start by singling out anyone more deserving than Ted and George, the Whips on our side. They have managed to keep the numbers up for us in very difficult circumstances. I thank the Whips on the other side of the House for playing along in that regard. I thank, too, the Manager of Opposition Business, Wal Fife. He is an old fox, but he helps keep this Parlia- ment ticking over in a most effective manner. I was going to say he is an easy person to deal with, but that would finish him for all time! It would also be a lie; he is not terribly easy to deal with, but he is honourable and when we are talking about issues of parliamentary standards, that certainly contributes to ensuring that there is tone in this place."
"I thank, too, the Clerks who, in the circumstances in which we have achieved unusually high productivity levels in leg- islation, have to work overtime. So in that regard I do thank very much Alan Brown- ing and the team. Particularly, too, I thank Clare Nairn, Parliamentary Liaison Offi- cer, and Del and Ruth in her office. This is Clare's first year in the job. I do not think anybody could possibly walk into that position and view her state with un- mitigated joy. She has acquitted herself extraordinarily well in this her first year as Parliamentary Liaison Officer who, as everybody here appreciates, is responsible for providing the basic data which keeps this place ticking over."
"Some people have been called upon to play more prominent roles than they might otherwise have done in normal circum- stances. Keeping the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney) alive is becom- ing a difficult exercise. It has called on the resources of the medical profession on both sides of the House, and they need' to be thanked on the honourable member's"

4968 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

"behalf. In fact, he has already thanked them. I can assure him, and he would not have been aware of it at the time it was happening, but all the rest of us' who feel that we may from time to time have the need of a doctor or nurse were paying very close attention to the bedside man- ner of the three doctors and several nurses who 'came to his assistance. I will not tell him what conclusions we arrived at in that regard, except to say that I think it would be universally the view that those who attended upon him had perhaps missed their vocation and should have 'stayed with their original professions: they were very good indeed."
"In particular, I would like to thank one of the nurses here, Jill Baker, who came to his assistance and would not normally have come to the attention of honourable members and hopefully will not do so often. There are a number who have been missed out. This place is a difficult Parlia- ment to operate, much more difficult than the previous Parliament. It is difficult po- litically and difficult organisationally, but it has colour, and a lot of that colour is provided by the commercial activities whieh take place here. I suppose pre- eminent among that is Aussie's Store, which really has come to add a consider- able degree Of character to this place; we all thank him. It has to be said that, as we see the goidchains proliferate, we do not assume around here that' it is an un- profitable exercise on his part. Neverthe- less, it is a colourful exercise. He is doing very well, and the way he works, he de- serves to do very well. I Then there is the front shop, there is the bank, the Qantas staff, Lizzie the hair- dresser, and all the drivers who serve us- and I particularly would like to thank John Trewhella of my staff in that regard. Then there are those who attempt to make us look a little different, and I probably should have included Lizzie the hair- dresser in that. There are others, however, whose task is even more daunting than that of Lizzie the hairdresser, and they are the women who work in the gym. 'They have faIled miserably with me for reasons I cannot fathom. But they are going to have to do better over the next"

"couple of months, I think, if all of us- and me particularly-are to survive what may be events which transpire in this chamber next year."
"I thank my Caucus colleagues, particu- l&rly, for their vigorous participation in debates in this chamber and their willing- ness to assist the Whips so well by turning up here. I thank my staff, who put in an enormous amount of time from my point of view in making sure that the Parlia- ment ticks over, particularly John O'Cal- laghan, who is the member of my staff responsible for dealing with the business of Parliament."
"I very much thank you, Mr Speaker. Perhaps I ought to have started with you but because you are a person who sits above us all and has absolutely no part in the proceedings of this place 'and there- fore does not normally come to the atten- tion of the Leader of the House who must operat~ in a totally partisan fashion. Nat- urally, it is the Whips I turn to first, rather than yourself. You have absolutely graced that position since you have held it. I was tremendously pleased to hear the tribute paid to you by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on your impar- tiality, and the solid view of the Opposi- tion in that regard. It is not often enough said, I think, but very justifiably stated by the Leader of the Opposition."
"A question has been raised by the Op- position from-time to time on the issue of televising Parliament. We have been giving that careful consideration following discussions earlier in the sitting between the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition. Before the Par- liament resumes for the autumn sittings, the Government intends to nail down the arrangements for introducing more com- prehensive broadcasting of proceedings. Of course we will be having discussions with you, Mr Speaker, about that and with relevant committees and the Oppo- sition. We do see considerable merit in wider broadcasting of parliamentary pro- ceedings and we are concerned to ensure that the best possible arrangements are put in place to facilitate this. Obviously, these discussions will occur with you, Mr Speaker, at some time over the next"

"I thank my ministerial colleagues and their staff, again for their participation in this place. As our numbers are smaller than in the previous parliament, much more of a role in parliament does come upon Ministers. They have acquitted themselves admirably in that regard. I thank the press gallery, too, for their bal- anced reporting of events in this place. But I do offer one plea to them: I do not actually have a lengthy period of experi- ence here, but I do have a lengthy mem- ory, given the fact that my father was here"

"ing all those who have helped to make parliament run during the past 12 months. In particular, I thank you, Mr Speaker, and the Clerks and the other members of the parliamentary staff, my opposite num- ber, the Leader of the House (Mr Bea- zley), and Clare Nairn and her staff for their cooperation. It is a difficult task to run the House. As the Leader of the House has indicated, without the full coopera- tion of all concerned it would not only be difficult but it would also result in the House being a shambles at all times."

"words. I would particularly like to thank my deputy, the honourable member for Stifling (Mr Ronald Edwards) for the hard work that he has put in this. -year. Having bee~ the. Deputy Speaker myself, I now feel sorry for the things that I did to Joan Child because they are now being done to me by Ron. I would particularly like to thank Margaret in his office who ensures that she arranges the rosters for the cham- ber so that at least there is someone here at all times."
"The Deputy Chairmen of Committees, who do the long grinds late into the night and get very little remuneration from the Remuneration Tribunal, deserve not only our thanks but maybe the support of the parties when the Remuneration Tribunal is looking at their allowances next year. The Leader of the House, the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife), and the Whips on both sides, as has been said earlier, do a great job in making sure that the chamber ticks over and that a great deal of matters are dealt with here in unanimity. It is unfortunate, as I think the Leader of the House said, that the press tends to be too interested in pro- moting any confrontation that occurs in the chamber rather than the fact that probably over 90 per cent of the legisla- tion that we deal with is passed by agree- ment. Particularly when one looks at committee work, one finds even more agreement among members."
"I would like to thank the Clerks and the staff of the House of Representatives Department, particularly ,the security and other attendants and the committee staff, for the work that they have done during the year. A number of new people have come into the Parliament this year. Old members have passed by and new mem- bers have come in. Some of them seem to have learnt bad habits rather quickly. I thought that Wilson Tuckey was going to get the award this year for the person with the most .number of ejections in the his- tory of the Parliament. In fact, I said to Wilson that I was going to get a videotape made of all the times he had been ejected, but we only had the videotape records, of this Parliament. Seeing that I could not give Wilson the full documentation of his"

"days of glory, he said he thought it was not worth while doing it for only a few episodes."
"I noticed in the last few days that the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Cos- tello) seemed to want to take over Wil- son's accolade, having regard to a few interjections from time to time. Maybe the Leader of the Opposition will move him further up the bench so that I can hear what he is saying, rather than just observing the gesticulations from the other end of the chamber. I do not know whether or not I am killing him with kindness in saying that."
"The' statements by the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the House about the standards of the Parliament having increased, and the remarks that the Prime Minister made earlier, this year, are very true. I think that in this Parlia- ment we have been more reasonable with each other, and I think that that is a good thing. There is no doubt that the parlia- mentary departments that the President and I jointly run have done a lot to help us during our time in the building this year: the Joint HQuse Department, partic- ularly from my experience with the cater- ing area with Col Christian, Jenny and the work that they have done; the Parlia- mentary Library; and those who report us, both in the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and in the Parliamentary Press Gal- lery-some' of whom report us accurately and, if one judges by the number of per- sonal explanations that members make, others behind me here, in the eyes of members, sometimes do not report them as accurately as they should."
"Those institutions, which are both cov- ered by the Australian Journalists Associ- ation, might have some sort of cross- fertilisation so that we might get some more accuracy in one and maybe a little more flair in the other. But the Parlia- mentary Reporting Staff have been through a difficult year. We have amal- gamated the Parliamentary Information Systems Office with the old Hansard de- partment. On behalf of all members, I pay tribute to the senior management in that Department and all the people in that Department for the way that they have"

Special Adjournment

21 December 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 4971

"looked at the amalgamation in a positive sense and for the product that they have turned out. We have seen this year and we will see next year a far better product for this Parliament, for members and for senators, a more timely product- from Hansard-and, as the Leader of the House has-intimated that we are going to televise the Parliament or the House of Represen- tatives, we will have a far more integrated approach. I would like to congratulate the staff of that amalgamated group for the positive way that they approached the amalgamation."
"At this time last year, I was able to inform the- House that 2.6 million people had passed through this building. In a couple of weeks time, we are expecting our four-millionth visitor. I suppose when we moved into this building, we all did so with some sort of worry that our con- stituents, when they came into the build- ing and saw the building, might say that we had spent too much money and that, as some of the press had said, it had become a sort of palace to ourselves. But the guides and the public relations people tell me that there are very, very few com- plaints about the building, and that people really feel a sense of pride in this Parlia- ment House."
"The fact that we have attracted four million visitors in so short a time has made this Parliament building the pre- mier tourist attraction in Australia. In- deed, earlier this year, in July, we were awarded the Australian Capital Territory tourism award for standards of excellence in hospitality in tourism. That says a great deal for the staff who work for us in this building-the little people whom most of us would just see in passing in the corri- dors, whom we do not know by name, but who are very hard-working people who are proud to work in this building and who are proud to play their small part in the running of this Parliament."
"I also thank my own staff, both in Sydney and in Canberra: Anne Stewart, my senior adviser, in particular, and Frank Arnold, my attend~nt, who has decided that the late nights in the Speaker's office were getting a bit too much for an old Navy fellow and who has decided to go"

"back on to day work. I do not know whether we work all that late in my office, but Frank wants a more regular lifestyle, and I would like to thank him very much for the work that he has done for me. I thank John May and his staff, who make sure that We get back here in time for divisions and that we get to the airport in time for the planes, and they will be mak- ing sure that we get delivered back to our electorates and families pretty quickly."
"As other speakers have said, the people who probably pay the price for our being here are our families. I think that one of the things we all ought to look at next year-and maybe the parties when they are talking to the Remuneration Tribunal and the Government-is the way we can facilitate better contact with our families, having regard to our life here. I have said to members in the past and I have said to the Tribunal that I think the fact that we only allow our children to visit us here on three occasions in a year is scandalous."
"When one looks at the way in which the age profile of members in this Parlia- ment has changed over the years, one can suppose that, in the days when that rule was made, this House was made up of men aged over 45 or 50. We now have young men and young women in here who have young families, and I think we should be looking at some mechanism that helps to bring them down here, to help them to participate in our jobs as mem- bers of parliament. We might find that that takes a lot of the pressure off some of our families and saves some disasters."
"The people we should all particularly thank at this time of year are our constit- uents who do us the great honour of giv- ing us the chance to serve in this Parliament. I do not think that many of them would realise the honour that we know it is to do so and how important it is to serve in this place. At any given time in the life of Australia, only 148 of us can sit in here and have a real say in the way our country runs. I do not think there is anything more important that you can do in your life than that. Before I put the question, I wish all honourable members and indeed honourable senators a happy and safe Christmas. I look forward to"

The following answers to questions were circulated:

Vietnamese Students
(Question No.1)
"Mr Sinclair asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 9 May 1990:"

"(1) With respect to Vietnamese students admit- ted to Australian educational institutions under Government aid programs, (a) how many have been admitted in each year since 1985, (b) to which institutions and courses were they admit- ted, (c) how long did each student stay in Aus- tralia, (d) is each student required to leave Australia upon ceasing studies, (e) what level of study results is required and what-course of action is followed if satisfactory standards are not achieved and (0 what is the cost to the taxpayer of their .studying in Australia."

Aborigines: Division of Parkes
(Question No. 183)
"Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Aborig- inal Affairs, upon notice, on 22 August 1990:"
"Will he provide details of all funding allocated by the Department of Employment, Education and Training to Aboriginal groups and individu- als in the Division of Parkes since the Depart- ment's inception."
Mr Tickner~The answer to the honourable member's question is as fol- lows:
"The Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) provides assistance to Ab- original groups and individuals under the Train- ing for Aboriginals Program (TAP) through the appropriation for Aboriginal Enterprise Employ- ment Assistance (270-6-03) and Aboriginal Em- ployment Assistance (270-6-09)."
"DEET's management information system indi- cates that there have been 545 trainees assisted undet Aboriginal Employment by the 5 CES of- fices in the Division of Parkes in the three finan- cial, years since DEET's inception."
"In addition, wage subsidy assistance has been provided to 123 employees of Aboriginal enter- prises under the Enterprise Employment Assist- ance scheme, bringing 688 the number of persons assisted. Estimated expenditure on these partic- ipants during the three financial years is $4.8 million."
"The expenditure figure is calculated using av- erage cost, numbers in' training and an average duration of training. The figure is an estimate only, as specific 'data cannot be aggregated by the management information system."
No fUnding is provided to Aboriginal groups from TAP apart from that noted above.
"Under the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy (AEP), which sub- sumed a number of other Aboriginal education programs from 1 January 1990, the Department assists Aboriginal students in the Division of Parkes. Information as to the funding levels are for 1990 only. Further information for funding prior to 1990 is unavailable at-this stage."
DEET provides assistance to Aboriginal stu- dents in NSW through the NSW Ministry of Education and Youth Affairs under Strategic and Operational Plans agreed to by the Common- wealth.
"Under these plans the only expenditure which can be specifically identified with the Parkes Di- vision is $800,000 approved for Aboriginal pre-"

"school education, although the AEP funding would also support other activities in the district."

"In addition, under the AEP two specific pro- grams are being funded by DEET, these are:"

"- the Aboriginal Student-Support and Parent Awareness Program provides assistance to some 2000 students in the Division at an estimated expenditure of $495,000 for 1990. This Program covers some 39 primary and secondary students in Parkes; and"

"- the Aboriginal Tutuorial Assistance Scheme supports approximately 2000 students across the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors in Parkes, with six homework centres and some 200 contracts for assistance. These con- tracts are on average for 5 months in dura- tion with an estimated cost to date of $63,000."

"All Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander stu- dents, including those from the Division of Parkes . are also eligible for income support through the Abstudy program. There is no facility to break down figures for Abstudy assistance by electorate as all claims from New South Wales are proc- essed at a single processing unit in Sydney."

(8) Were officers of the NCA responsible for leaking information about Mr O'Brien which was likely to place his safety in jeopardy.

(2) Has his attention also been drawn to Mr O'Brien's complaint that his involvement in the Witness Protection Program and his role as an informer is the result of his entrapment by NCA officers.

Mr Duffy-The answer to the honour- able member's question is as follows:

4976 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

Answers to Questions

"(1) I am aware of the complaints. Mr O'Brien's solicitors, O'Connor Bellamy have written to me making similar allegations on behalf of Mr O'Brien. Both Mr Mack's question and the O'Connor Bellamy letter make grave allegations concerning police officers attached to the National Crime Authority (NCA). It is appropriate that they be treated formally as complaints under the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 or the equivalent State legislation. Some earlier complaints by Mr O'Brien (not involving the NCA) are already being examined under the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981."

"(2) I am aware of Mr O'Brien's allegation that his ""involvement in the Witness Protection Pro- gram and his role as an informer is the result of entrapment by NCA officers""."

"The Director of Public Prosecutions has pro- vided me with information as to the background to Mr O'Brien's involvement. The matter arose from charges under Section 223B (1) (cb) of the Customs Act 1901, in relation to an alleged con- spiracy to import 1.6 tonnes of cannabis resin, at Sydney on 24 December 1988. Ten persons were charged by the investigative authority, the NCA. Mr Reginald Michael O'Brien, one of the alleged conspirators had, early in the investigations, agreed to give evidence against his alleged co- conspirators on the condition that he be granted an indemnity from prosecution. There is no hint of Mr O'Brien having been coerced or ""im- trapped"" into the agreement."

Participation in the witness security scheme administered by the Australian Federal Police is voluntary. Mr O'Brien is free to terminate the relationship at any time.

National Museum of Australia

An Aboriginal Advisory Committee was estab- lished in 1984 by the Council of the Museum to provide advice to Aboriginal and Torres Strait

"Islander communities on the operations of the Museum. A position of Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Ad- viser has recently been created. The role of this position will be to advise Museum staff on mat- ters pertaining to Aboriginal heritage and cul- ture and to establish effective consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander commu- nities, agencies and other relevant groups. The Adviser will inform these communities' about the activities and resources of the National Mu- seum of Australia and seek appropriate input to Museum programs. The Museum' has recruited six curatorial staff with expertise in the fields of social history and Aboriginal studies to help to respond to the demands of the Australian community for ac- cess to the Museum's collection. The Museum has engaged two ethnic collections consultants to advise on the general approach that the Museum might adopt to the role and significance of immigration in Australian his- tory. These consultants have communicated with a range of ethnic organisations including repre- sentatives of the Austrian, Czechoslovakian, Hungarian, Polish, Chinese and Indo-Chinese communities. The Museum is in the process of establishing links with a range of community groups (eg women's organisations, the peace movement and environmental organisations) to broaden its base of participation. Australian Heritage Commission In regard to Aboriginal matters, where nomina- tions of Aboriginal sites for the Register of the Nat~onal Estate are received by the Commis- sion, from sources such as researchers carrying out National Estate Grants Program studies, every effort is made to ensure that consultation with the relevant Aboriginal communities takes place. A co-opted Aboriginal Commissioner, Dr Bill Jonas assists this process. Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) The Central Office of the Service has produced publications and brochures eg 'Australian Ani- mals and Plants-Enjoy and Protect Them' in 12 community languages. Information on endangered species, wildlife conservation and international wildlife trade is- sues is distributed to the Australian Customs Service, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Quarantine Service to assist in the development of briefing material for tourists and migrants.

Kakadu and Uluru (Ayers Rock-Mount Olga) National Parks have Boards of Management ap- pointed by the Minister comprised of Aboriginal representatives of the traditional owners, ANPWS staff and representatives of special in- terest' groups. The Boards of Management regu- larly review, monitor and evaluate services, policies and programs to ensure that Aboriginal considerations are taken into account in the day to day management of the Parks. Plans of Management for parks and reserves declared under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (NPWC) Act 1975 are prepared by the Director, where appropriate, in conjunc- tion with the relevant Board. Plans of Manage- ment, Which are the principal policy statements for the parks, are reViewed on a regular basis and access and equity requirements taken into account via the involvement of the Board or Advisory Committee and by public submissions when preparing a new plan. For .. national parks on Aboriginal land, the NPWC Act provides for consultation with Ab- original Land Councils in preparation of Plans of Management. Additional consultation with tradi.tional Aboriginal owners is via community advisers, Aboriginal staff, community liaison of- ficers, contact with Aboriginal organisations or thro)lgh the establishment of special' consulta- tive committees whose role specifically relates to preparation of the Plans of Management. Before proclamation of a park or reserve under the NPWC Act, a public notice is issued by the Director of the ANPWS indicating he intends to prepare a report recommending proclamation of an area as a park or reserve and invites public representation in connection with the re- port. The Director, when submitting his report to Executive Council, must give due considera- tion to any comments on those representations.

Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority The Authority is dependent upon public input into zoning plans. Whenever a zoning plan is about, to be prepared or reviewed, reef users,"

"including Aboriginal people who use the Reef for traditional purposes, are invited to give their opinions on how zoning should be undertaken as well as providing information about their use of the Reef. This information is collated. Con- flicts in usage are resolved and a draft zoning plan is prepared. The draft plan is advertised and public comment is again sought before the Plan is finalised and tabled in Parliament."

"The Great Barrier Reef Consultative Committee was established by the Great Barrier Reef Ma- rine Park Act 1975 as an independent body for , both the Minister and the Authority. The Con- sultative Committee represents a wide cross sec- tion of interests in the Great Barrier Reef, from both the public and private sectors, including tourism, fishing, science, conservation and the Aboriginal community. The Consultative Com- mittee's role is to furnish advice to the Minister, either of its own motion or upon request made by the Minister, in respect of matters relating to the operations of the Act; and to furnish advice to the Authority in respect of matters relating to the Marine Park, including advice as to the areas that should be parts of the Marine Park, referred to it by the Authority."

Road Accidents
(Question No. 321)
"Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 9 October 1990:"

"What was the (a) road accident rate, by all measures, (b) number of people hospitalised as a direct result of road accidents, (i) in total and (ii) by types and degrees and (c) total number of vehicles registered as (i) private vehicles, (ii) mo- torcycles, (iii) buses, (iv) rigid trucks and '(v) articulated trucks, in each State and Territory in each year since 1980."

Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as fol- lows:
(a) National figures on road crash rates are only available for two levels of severity:
"Fatal crashes~resulting in at least one fatality within 30 days of the crash, arid Serious Injury crashes-resulting in at least one person being admitted to hospital."
Casualty rates are typically measured in three ways:
"Casualties per 100,000 population"
"Casualties per 10,000 vehicles registered"
Casualties per 100 million Vehicle Kilometres Travelled
Fatalities and Fatality rates are given in At- tachment I.
Serious Injuries and Serious Injury Rates are given in Attachment II.
"In addition, Fatal crash rates have been calcu- lated for particular vehicle types, in 1988. These are given in Attachment III."
"(b) There are no nationally consistent data cur- rently available on casualties of any less severity than Serious Injury. No data are currently avail- able on degree of injury for either Fatal, or Seri- ous Injuries."
"(c) Vehicle registrations are given in Attach- ment IV. As no data is available on use of vehicle ie private/business, the total of all 'Motor-cars (Motor cars, Station Wagons, Utilities and Panel Vans) is given as a proxy for total 'private vehi- cles'."

General Public Listing of Airlines
(Question No. 345)
"Mr Moore asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 17 October 1990:"
"(l) Has his attention been drawn to a statement by the Prime Minister at a press conference on 24 September 1990 that in selling 49 per cent of Qantas, and allowing some employee involvement, the opportunities for general public listing would be limited."
"(2) Has his attention also been drawn to the fact that when the New Zealand Government pri- vatised Air New Zealand, 25 per cent of the airline was offered to the general public al- lowing 34 239 New Zealanders, 20 per cent of whom had never owned shares before, to"

"buy 62 million shares and a further 5 per cent to employees. (3) In view of the strong public demand for airline shares experienced in New Zealand, why is only 49 per cent of Qantas being offered for sale."
Mr Beazley-The answer to the honourable member's question is as fol- lows:
"'(1) I am aware of the Prime Minister's press conferen~e statement of 24 September 1990 in regard to Qantas. In fact, the news confer- ence referred to was called jointly by the Prime Minister and myself. The final arrangements for the selling of equity in Qantas have yet to be determined."

4990 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

Answers to Questions

"In determining the final equity arrangements the Government will need to take account of the benefits that can be realised from the formation or consolidation of commercial al- liances with other airlines, via strategic in- vestments, the benefits that can be obtained from employee share ownership, as well as from purchases of shares in Qantas by the general public. Every effort will be made, taking account of the balance of interests, to allow for equity participation by the public."

"ticipant in the ownership consortium guarantee- ing, or leading to, majority Australian ownership."
"(2) The merged carrier, Telecom/OTC, is to remain in full public ownership. All Australians therefore have an investment in Telecom."

Public Housing
(Question No. 351)
"Mr Prosser asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, .upon notice, on 17 October 1990:"

What Commonwealth funding has been given to each State and Territory each year from 1987-88 for (a) public housing and (b) upkeep of public housing.
Mr Howe-The answer to the honour- able member's question is as follows:
(a) The table shows the funds provided for public rental housing:

COMMONWEALTH FUNDS PROVIDED FOR RENTAL HOUSING ($'000) (i)

New South Wales . Victoria Queensland Western Australia. South Australia Tasmania. Australian Capital Territory (ii) Northern Territory TOTAL (iii) .

"17,262 61,250 1,001,108"

(i) These funds have been provided to the States primarily through the Commonwealth/State

Housing Agreement (CSHA). The totals for 1987-88 and 1988-89 exclude Commonwealth funds

"used for home purchase assistance; under the then CSHA, States could determine the allocation"

"of funds to home purchase or rental. Within the totals shown for 1989-90 and 1990-91, States,"

"under the 1989 CSHA, are able to use on average 12 per cent of funds for home purchase"

"assistance. However, actual amounts used are not yet available. The amounts. for all years exclude"

funds used for mortgage and private rent assistance.

.

"(ii) The ACT has been a signatory to the CSHA since 1989-90. For 1987-88 and 1988-89, Common"" .wealth funding for public housing was provided to the ACT on a basis comparable to CSHA arrangements."

(iii) Rounding errors may occur.

No Commonwealth funding is specifically provided for the up-keep ormaintenance of public housing.

This cost is largely met through rent payments from public housing ten'ants. Where total recurrent

"costs for a State housing authority (including maintenance) exceed rental income, the 1989 CSHA"

allows States to use an amount of CSHA capital funding otherwise available to construct or purchase

"dwellings, to offset this loss. A similar arrangement applied under the 1984 CSHA."

"(2) Is Bunbury Pathology and its adrninistra- tion competent and otherwise suitable to carry out the usual range of pathology services; if so, (a) why was approval for .Medicare payments to Bunbury Pathology for its first threl( weeks of operation withheld and (b) will he make special provision for those payments to be made."
"(3) When will he reply to my urgent facsimile message on this matter, dated August 1990."
Mr .Howe-The answer to the honour- able member's question is as follows:
(1) I am aware of difficulties experienced by Bunbury Pathology. I understand Bunbury Pa- thology commenced business late' in July 1990. Discussions were held between the Health Insur- ance Commission and Bunbury Pathology in May 1990 on the requirements associated with the payment of Medicare benefits for pathology serv- ices. The Commission advised a requirement to apply to my Department for accreditation of the laboratory; the National Association of Testing Associations for inspection of the laboratory premises; and to the Commission for the accept-

ance of pathology undertakings. Applications for the acceptance of approved pathology authority and approved pathology practitioner undertak- ings were submitted to the Commission and were accepted with effect-from 3 July and 6 July 1990 respectively.

In spite of the advice provided by the Com-

"mission, which included contact telephone num-"

"bers for laboratory accreditation enquiries,"

Bunbury Pathology failed to seek accreditation

for their pathology laboratory until 23 August

1990. The Health Insurance Act 1973 Provides

that Medicare benefits are not payable if a labo-

ratory is not. accredited and information about

this legislative requirement is included in Com-

mission literature which accompanies approved

pathology authority and approved pathology

practitioner docurnentation. The application to

my Department for accreditation of the labora-

tory was lodged on 23 August 1990 and approved

from that date.

'

(2) (a) Approval was granted from the date of lodgment ~nd was not withheld.

2 (b) The Health Insurance Act 1973 prevents backdating accreditation.

(3) A reply to the honourable member's corre- spondence was signed and mailed on 25 October 1990.

It is currently being used as a key reference for the review of residential development regulations by 51 councils throughout Australia under the 1989/90 Triple-R Program. A further 40 to 50 councils are to be assisted under 1990/91 TripIe- R Program with similar numbers expected in Year 3 (1991/92).
In addition to these councils: - Ringwood Council in Victoria has already
adopted a new code completely based on the Model Code. - Albert Shire Council in Queensland has con- structed a 5000 lot subdivision in Residential A Zoning completely in accordance with the Model Code. - Queensland Government has provided ad- vice to all its local governments on how they can adopt the Model Code. (2) Councils throughout Australia are expected to adopt the Model Code over the next three to five- years as: - Triple-R Program funding is extended to en- able councils to review their existing codes. - State governments encourage and facilitate the adoption of the Model Code's structure and requirements into State legislature and practices.

"- ,Queensland has sought permission to in- clude all the Model Code's provisions into the Queensland Government Gazette so that local governments can adopt and adapt the Model Code to their local area."

- Victoria is to review its 1987 Residen- tial Development Provisions in the light of the 1990 Edition 2 of the Model Code.

- Western Australia will review its R-codes to align with the Model Code.

Closure of Medicare Offices

"139 notice, on 12 November 1990:"

385 496 909 309 540 432

Mr Howe-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:

608 (1) Yes.

4998 REPRESENTATIVES 21 December 1990

Answers to Questions

"(a) Yes. However, the Commission is consid- ering the introduction of a claims collection fa- cility in Leeton and Narrandera to provide a fast path for the delivery of claims to a Commission processing centre for priority processing and pay- ment of benefits."
"(b) A projected saving of $120,750 per annum. (2) Yes. (a) No. However, the close proximity of other branch offices was taken into consideration be- fore any decision was made to close these offices. (b) Savings of approximately $1 milJion per year will result."
Medicare Benefits Schedule
(Question No. 399)
"'Dr Bob Woods asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 12 November 1990:"
"Were the majority of medical practitioners in South Australia not advised of the changes to the fees and item numbers of the Medicare Benefits Schedule prior to their taking effect on 1 Novem- ber 1990; if they were not, why not."
Mr Howe-The answer to the honour- able member's question is as follows:
"Many medical practitioners in South Australia, Victoria and Queensland did not receive advice of the Medicare Benefits Schedule changes prior to 1 November 1990. This was due to the failure of the printer to meet the delivery date of 19 October 1990 for distribution of the amend- ments, despite assurances to my Department by the printer that production was ahead of schedule."
"Responsibility for the letting of contracts to the private sector relating to the production and dis- tribution of publications such as the Medicare Benefits Schedule rests with the Australian Gov- ernment Publishing Service (AGPS). My Depart- ment lodged ""camera ready"" copy of the 1 November amendments with AGPS on 12 September 1990, which was sufficient time to allow printing and distribution to medical prac- titioners in all States prior to the 1 November 1990 date of effect."
"The performance of the printer in terms 'of his contractual obligations was completely unsatis- factory, and my Department has already advised AGPS that that particular printer wilJ not be acceptable for future printing contracts associated with the Medicare Benefits Schedule."
Victorian Prostitutes Collective
(Question No. 402)
"Dr Bob Woods asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 12 November 1990:"
"Has a combined Commonwealth and Victorian Government grant of $40,200 been made to the"

"Victorian Prostitutes Collective to employ a re- search worker; if so, (a) why, (b) what will be researched and (c) what wilJ the results of the research be used for."
Mr Howe-The answer to the honour- able member's question is as follows:
"Under the HIV/AIDS Matched Funding Pro- gram, Commonwealth allocations are matched on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the States and Terri- tories. States and Territories are required to ex- pend these funds, which are used for a range of activities including education, prevention, re- ~earch, treatment and care, in accordance with guidelines agreed between the Commonwealth and State Governments. The States and Territories have full responsibility for the allocation and administration of Matched Funds."
"The Victorian Department of Health has ad- vised me that, although Victoria does fund the Victorian Prostitutes Collective under the Matched Funding Program, the funding is not provided to employ a research worker."
ABC: Home Show
(Question No. 406)
"Mr Ewen Cameron asked the Minister for Transport ap.d Communications, upon notice, on 13 November 1990:"
"(1) Is the ABC television program ""The Home Show"" subsidised by individuals or bodies who may gain commercial advantage from their involvement with the program; if so, (a) which individuals or bodies and (b) what sum does each contribute."
"(2) Did another ABC television program, ""The Investigators',' regularly highlight cases of shoddy dwelling construction before ""The Home Show"" commenced."
"(3) Has ""The Investigators"" dealt with any cases of shoddy dwelling construction since ""The Home Show"" commenced."
"(4) Did ABC Television in Sydney agree in a telephone conversation with the Chairperson of the Building Action Review Group (BARG) in Sydney to film BARG members displaying banners referring to BARG's De- fective Homes Exhibition on 28 October 1990; if so, (a) was the venue to be outside the premises of the NSW Royal Commission into the Building Industry at Circular Quay, (b) did the ABC leave a message on the BARG answering machine on 25 October 1990 cancelling the filming arrangements and (c) given that the event was covered by all three commercial television channels in Sydney, why did the ABC cancel its cover- age."

"however, it is being expanded to include domes- tic production. As part of this expansion, consid- eration is being given to the inclusion of imported products. The National Residue Survey includes monitoring of pesticides in citrus fruits but does 'not include juices or concentrates. DPIE is una- ware of any State or Territory programme specif- ically for monitoring residues of pesticides in fruit juices or concentrates."
A range of regulatory and educational measures is being undertaken by the States and Territories to reduce the presence of pesticide residues in locally produced products. It should be noted that legislative responsibility for use of pesticides in Australia is a State or Territory matter and that the Commonwealth government has strongly advocated measures to minimise residues in food through the various coordinating mechanisms available to it.
"In the, international context, the Australian Gov.ernment strongly supports the acceptance of internationally agreed standards for pesticide res- idues. Australia participates in the development of the standards recommended by the Codex Al- imentarious Commission. The monitoring of high risk products for chemical residues in the import inspection programme and the proposed inclu- sion of imported products in the National Resi- due Survey are other measures aimed at reducing the likelihood of pesticide residues in imported products."

"(2) (a) In the Government's view the ANC is not merely a political party but is a major partner in the political process currently, underway in South Africa. At the same time it ha~ no right to contest elections and it has no formal status within the existing political structures in South Africa."

Middle East
(Question No. 444)
"Mr John Scott asked the Minister rep- resenting the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 5 December 1990:"
"Further to the answer to question No. 52 (Han- sard, 7 November 1990, page 3496) concerning the even-handedness of the Australian Govern- ment's policy towards the parties to the Arab- Israeli conflict, did the Government:"
"(a) unambiguously condemn the killing of at least 20 Palestinian demonstrators by Israeli security forces in Jerusalem on 8 October 1990; if not, why not;"
"(b) on 28 May 1990 support the emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel, which Israeli Prime Minis- ter Shamir said, on 19 November 1990, should be to the ""Land of Israel from the sea to the River Jordan""; if so, what action has the Govern- ment taken to press the Government of Israel to abide by UN General Assembly Resolution 194 (III) which affirms the right of Palestinian refu- gees to return to their homes; and,"
"(c) while taking swift action to oppose the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, take similar-action against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and its annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem in defiance of UN Security Council Resolution 242; if not, why not."
Dr Blewett-The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the fol- lowing answer to the honourable mem- ber's question:
"(a) In a statement issued on 9 October as act- ing Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I deplored the deaths of some 20 Palestinians in East Jerusalem the previous day when Israeli se- curity forces had fired on a large crowd of dem- onstrators. I acknowledged that the Israeli authorities had faced a very difficult situation, but I said the use of force on such a large scale appeared on the evidence available to be dispro- portionate. In my statement I said that the Israeli authorities must recognise the need for maximum"

restraint as tragic incidents such as that which took place on 8 October can only increase the frustration and antagonism of the Palestinian popuhition.
"(b) The Government made no statement on the emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel on 28 May 1990. Mr Scott may be referring to Senator Evans's statement of 23 May in the Senate in response to a Question Without Notice in which Senator Evans said: ""I would like to make it very clear that Australia wholeheartedly welcomes developments in the Soviet Union which have allowed Soviet Jews to emigrate. This is an issue on which Australia pressed the Soviet Union for several years""."
"Senator Evans added: ""While nobody can have any possible objection to the emigration of such Soviet Jews to Israel, I, on behalf of the Austra- lian Government, however share the concern ex- pressed by a number of other countries that some of these new migrants have been allowed to settle in the Occupied Territories and that the Israeli Government is apparently willing to allow an increase in these numbers. It is obvious that con- tinued movement into the Occupied Territories, including East Jerusalem, does not encourage Palestinians to pursue a negotiated path towards a dialogue with Israel. Again, I urge Israel and all other parties to the dispute to refrain from actions which might jeopardise the prospects of peace in the region."""
"Australia voted in favour of UN General As- sembly Resolution 194 (III) of 1948, which re- solved in paragraph 11 that refugees displaced in the 1948 Arab/Israeli War should be allowed to return to their homes. In relation to this issue I refer Mr Scott to an answer by Senator Evans to a Question Without Notice in the Senate on 21 May (tabled 25 May)."
(c) Australia has opposed Israel's continuing occupation of the territories it occupied during the 1967 Arab/Israeli war. We support UN Se- curity Council Resolution 242 calling for Israel's withdrawal from these territories. The circum- stances of Israel's occupation of territory in 1967 were significantly different from the situation this year when Iraq invaded Kuwait. The Govern- ment rejects any linkage between the two issues.
